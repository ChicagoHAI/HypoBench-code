    "task_description": "Given a tweet, determine the likely voting preference of the person for the 2028 U.S. presidential election. The classification should consider whether the individual is likely to vote for the Democratic candidate, the Republican candidate, a third-party candidate, or abstain from voting. The analysis should take into account explicit endorsements, political ideology, sentiment toward candidates and policies, use of partisan language, engagement with political topics, and references to past voting behavior. Additionally, indirect indicators such as reactions to major political events, stance on key social and economic issues, and alignment with party-affiliated hashtags or slogans should be factored into the prediction. The classification should aim to capture both strong political affiliations and nuanced, context-dependent voting tendencies.",
