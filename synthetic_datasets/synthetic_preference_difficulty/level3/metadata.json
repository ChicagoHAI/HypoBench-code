Preferences may include categories such as favorite activities, political orientation, preferred entertainment genres, dietary choices, technology usage, shopping habits, and social behaviors. The prediction should consider explicit statements (e.g., \"I love hiking\"), implicit cues (e.g., frequent mentions of outdoor gear brands), sentiment analysis (e.g., positive sentiment towards a particular movie or product), and linguistic style (e.g., formal vs. informal tone indicating professional vs. casual interests). The model should account for contextual clues, emojis, hashtags, and engagement patterns (e.g., retweets, likes) to refine preference classification.",
