        "Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to garner substantial interest in medical imaging. The potential applications are vast and include the entirety of the medical imaging life cycle from image creation to diagnosis to outcome prediction. The chief obstacles to development and clinical implementation of AI algorithms include availability of sufficiently large, curated, and representative training data that includes expert labeling (eg, annotations). Current supervised AI methods require a curation process for data to optimally train, validate, and test algorithms. Currently, most research groups and industry have limited data access based on small sample sizes from small geographic areas. In addition, the preparation of data is a costly and time-intensive process, the results of which are algorithms with limited utility and poor generalization. In this article, the authors describe fundamental steps for preparing medical imaging data in AI algorithm development, explain current limitations to data curation, and explore new approaches to address the problem of data availability. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020",
        "Background Chest radiography has not been validated for its prognostic utility in evaluating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Purpose To analyze the prognostic value of a chest radiograph severity scoring system for younger (nonelderly) patients with COVID-19 at initial presentation to the emergency department (ED); outcomes of interest included hospitalization, intubation, prolonged stay, sepsis, and death. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, patients between the ages of 21 and 50 years who presented to the ED of an urban multicenter health system from March 10 to March 26, 2020, with COVID-19 confirmation on real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction were identified. Each patient's ED chest radiograph was divided into six zones and examined for opacities by two cardiothoracic radiologists, and scores were collated into a total concordant lung zone severity score. Clinical and laboratory variables were collected. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship between clinical parameters, chest radiograph scores, and patient outcomes. Results The study included 338 patients: 210 men (62%), with median age of 39 years (interquartile range, 31\u201345 years). After adjustment for demographics and comorbidities, independent predictors of hospital admission (n = 145, 43%) were chest radiograph severity score of 2 or more (odds ratio, 6.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.5, 11; P < .001) and obesity (odds ratio, 2.4 [95% CI: 1.1, 5.4] or morbid obesity). Among patients who were admitted, a chest radiograph score of 3 or more was an independent predictor of intubation (n = 28) (odds ratio, 4.7; 95% CI: 1.8, 13; P = .002) as was hospital site. No significant difference was found in primary outcomes across race and ethnicity or those with a history of tobacco use, asthma, or diabetes mellitus type II. Conclusion For patients aged 21\u201350 years with coronavirus disease 2019 presenting to the emergency department, a chest radiograph severity score was predictive of risk for hospital admission and intubation. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To evaluate the feasibility of cutaneous and subcutaneous limb tissue elasticity measurement in participants with limb lymphedema by using acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography. Materials and Methods From July 2015 to June 2017, ARFI elastography was performed in 64 participants with lymphedema (seven men and 57 women; age range, 23\u201385 years) by using a US system. Tissue stiffness quantification with shear-wave velocity (SWV) was obtained in the cutaneous and subcutaneous limb tissues. Lymphoscintigraphy was the reference standard. Results SWV was significantly higher in limbs with lymphatic obstruction than in unaffected limbs (cutaneous tissue: 2.75 m/sec vs 1.74 m/sec, respectively; subcutaneous tissue: 1.90 m/sec vs 1.35 m/sec, respectively; P < .001). SWV was significantly different among limbs without lymphatic drainage obstruction, with partial obstruction, and with total obstruction (cutaneous tissue: 1.74 m/sec vs 2.75 m/sec vs 2.77 m/sec; subcutaneous tissue: 1.35 m/sec vs 1.90 m/sec vs 1.90 m/sec, respectively; P < .001). By using a cut-off value of 2.10 m/sec and 1.43 m/sec for cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue, respectively, sensitivity was 83.1% (59 of 71) and 80.3% (57 of 71), and specificity was 86.0% (49 of 57) and 70.2% (40 of 57) for manifestation of lymphatic obstruction. The corresponding areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.91 and 0.83, respectively. Conclusion Acoustic radiation force impulse elastography showed that cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues are stiffer in lymphedematous limbs than in unaffected limbs. Acoustic radiation force impulse elastography is a feasible imaging modality for noninvasive tissue stiffness quantification in limb lymphedema. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Background Radiomics-based biomarkers enable the prognostication of resected non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but their effectiveness in clinical stage and pathologic stage IA pure-solid tumors requires further determination. Purpose To construct an efficient radiomics signature for survival risk stratification personalized for patients with clinical stage and pathologic stage IA pure-solid NSCLC. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, six radiomics signatures were constructed for patients with stage IA pure-solid NSCLC who underwent resection between January 2011 and December 2013 at authors' institution and were tested in the radiogenomics data set. The radiomics features were extracted from the intratumoral two-dimensional region, three-dimensional volume, and peritumoral area using PyRadiomics. The discriminative abilities of the signatures were quantified using the area under the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and the optimal signature was selected for patient stratification. Results The study included 592 patients with stage IA pure-solid NSCLC (median age, 61 years; interquartile range, 55\u201366 years; 269 women) for radiomics analysis: 381 patients for training, 163 for internal validation, and 48 for external validation. The radiomics signature combining three-region features yielded the highest 3- and 5-year AUCs of 0.77 and 0.78, respectively, in the internal validation set and 0.76 and 0.75, respectively, in the external validation set. Multivariable analysis suggested that the radiomics signature remained an independent prognostic factor (hazard ratio, 6.2; 95% CI: 3.5, 11.0; P < .001) and improved the discriminative ability and clinical usefulness of conventional clinical predictors. Conclusion The radiomics signature with multiregional features helped stratify the survival risk of patients with clinical stage and pathologic stage IA pure-solid non\u2013small cell lung cancer.

        "Background Results of recent phantom studies show that variation in CT acquisition parameters and reconstruction techniques may make radiomic features largely nonreproduceable and of limited use for prognostic clinical studies. Purpose To investigate the effect of CT radiation dose and reconstruction settings on the reproducibility of radiomic features, as well as to identify correction factors for mitigating these sources of variability. Materials and Methods This was a secondary analysis of a prospective study of metastatic liver lesions in patients who underwent staging with single-energy dual-source contrast material\u2013enhanced staging CT between September 2011 and April 2012. Technique parameters were altered, resulting in 28 CT data sets per patient that included different dose levels, section thicknesses, kernels, and reconstruction algorithm settings. By using a training data set (n = 76), reproducible intensity, shape, and texture radiomic features (reproducibility threshold, R2 \u2265 0.95) were selected and correction factors were calculated by using a linear model to convert each radiomic feature to its estimated value in a reference technique. By using a test data set (n = 75), the reproducibility of hierarchical clustering based on 106 radiomic features measured with different CT techniques was assessed. Results Data in 78 patients (mean age, 60 years \u00b1 10; 33 women) with 151 liver lesions were included. The percentage of radiomic features deemed reproducible for any variation of the different technical parameters was 11% (12 of 106). Of all technical parameters, reconstructed section thickness had the largest impact on the reproducibility of radiomic features (12.3% [13 of 106]) if only one technical parameter was changed while all other technical parameters were kept constant. The results of the hierarchical cluster analysis showed improved clustering reproducibility when reproducible radiomic features with dedicated correction factors were used (\u03c1 = 0.39\u20130.71 vs \u03c1 = 0.14\u20130.47). Conclusion Most radiomic features are highly affected by CT acquisition and reconstruction settings, to the point of being nonreproducible. Selecting reproducible radiomic features along with study-specific correction factors offers improved clustering reproducibility. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "A 14-year-old boy presented with asthenia, low back pain, and abdominal distention. The onset of symptoms was slow and progressive over a few months. The patient had no contributing past medical history. At physical examination, all vital signs were normal. Only pallor and positive fluid wave test results were noted; there was no lower limb edema, mucocutaneous lesions, or palpable lymph node enlargement. Laboratory work-up revealed a decreased hemoglobin concentration of 9.3 g/dL (normal range, 12-16 g/dL) and a decreased hematocrit level of 29.8% (normal range, 37%-45%), but all other laboratory values were normal. Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed (Figs 1-3).",
        "Background Cervical spine CT is regularly performed to exclude cervical spine injury during the initial evaluation of trauma patients. Patients with asymmetry of the lateral atlantodental interval (LADI) often undergo subsequent MRI to rule out ligamentous injuries. The clinical relevance of an asymmetric LADI and the benefit of additional MRI remain unclear. Purpose To evaluate the diagnostic benefit of additional MRI in patients with blunt trauma who have asymmetry of the LADI and no other cervical injuries. Materials and Methods Patients who underwent cervical spine CT during initial trauma evaluation between March 2017 and August 2019 were retrospectively evaluated. Those who underwent subsequent MRI because of LADI asymmetry of 1 mm or greater with no other signs of cervical injury were identified and reevaluated by two readers blinded to clinical data and initial study reports regarding possible ligamentous injuries. Results Among 1553 patients, 146 (9%) had LADI asymmetry of 1 mm or greater. Of these, 46 patients (mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 39 years \u00b1 22; 28 men; median LADI asymmetry, 2.4 mm [interquartile range, 1.8-3.1 mm]) underwent supplementary MRI with no other signs of cervical injury at initial CT. Ten of the 46 patients (22%) showed cervical tenderness at clinical examination, and 36 patients (78%) were asymptomatic. In two of the 46 patients (4%), MRI revealed alar ligament injury; both of these patients showed LADI asymmetry greater than 3 mm, along with cervical tenderness at clinical examination, and underwent treatment for ligamentous injury. In 13 of the 46 patients (28%), signal intensity alterations of alar ligaments without signs of rupture were observed. Four of these 13 patients (31%) were subsequently treated for ligamentous injury despite being asymptomatic. Conclusion Subsequent MRI following CT of the cervical spine in trauma patients with lateral atlantodental interval asymmetry may have diagnostic benefit only in symptomatic patients. In asymptomatic patients without proven cervical injuries, subsequent MRI showed no diagnostic benefit and may even lead to overtreatment. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To investigate the value of T2-weighted-based radiomics compared with qualitative assessment at T2-weighted imaging and diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging for diagnosis of clinical complete response in patients with rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy-radiation therapy (CRT). Materials and Methods This retrospective study included 114 patients with rectal cancer who underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging after CRT between March 2012 and February 2016. Median age among women (47 of 114, 41%) was 55.9 years (interquartile range, 45.4-66.7 years) and median age among men (67 of 114, 59%) was 55 years (interquartile range, 48-67 years). Surgical histopathologic analysis was the reference standard for pathologic complete response (pCR). For qualitative assessment, two radiologists reached a consensus. For radiomics, one radiologist segmented the volume of interest on high-spatial-resolution T2-weighted images. A random forest classifier was trained to separate the patients by their outcomes after balancing the number of patients in each response category by using the synthetic minority oversampling technique. Statistical analysis was performed by using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, McNemar test, and Benjamini-Hochberg method. Results Twenty-one of 114 patients (18%) achieved pCR. The radiomic classifier demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.93 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.87, 0.96), sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 0.84, 1), specificity of 91% (95% CI: 0.84, 0.96), positive predictive value of 72% (95% CI: 0.53, 0.87), and negative predictive value of 100% (95% CI: 0.96, 1). The diagnostic performance of radiomics was significantly higher than was qualitative assessment at T2-weighted imaging or DW imaging alone (P < .02). The specificity and positive predictive values were significantly higher in radiomics than were at combined T2-weighted and DW imaging (P < .0001). Conclusion T2-weighted-based radiomics showed better classification performance compared with qualitative assessment at T2-weighted and DW imaging for diagnosing pCR in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer after CRT. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Background Although favorable outcomes have been reported with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for limited hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the efficacy of this treatment for recurrent HCC has not been thoroughly investigated. Purpose To compare the long-term outcomes and analyze the prognostic factors for outcomes after RFA for initial HCC versus as a second-line treatment for recurrent HCC. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included 560 patients with solitary tumors 5 cm or smaller (263 initial HCCs, 297 -recurrent HCCs) who underwent percutaneous US-guided RFA from January 2005 to December 2016. Of 297 patients with -recurrent HCC, 134 had previously undergone hepatectomy, 128 had undergone transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), and 35 had undergone local ablation therapy. Overall survival (OS) between initial HCC and recurrent HCC was compared before and after propensity score matching. Prognostic factors for all patients were analyzed with the log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards model. Results A total of 560 patients (mean age, 60 years \u00b1 12 [standard deviation]; 441 men) were evaluated. Before matching, the OS rates at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years were 92.6%, 73.9%, 59.3%, and 39.6%, respectively, in patients with recurrent HCC and 92.8%, 75.4%, 63.3%, and 44.7% in patients with initial HCC (P = .27). After matching, the OS rates at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years were 94.8%, 75.7%, 61.6%, and 47.3% in the initial HCC group and 91.9%, 71.2%, 58.7%, and 45.2% in the recurrent HCC group (P = .32). Among patients with recurrent HCC, no significant difference in mean OS was noted for local recurrence versus distant recurrence (81.6 months \u00b1 5.1 vs 83.8 months \u00b1 6.6, P = .82) or previous treatment modality (82.0 months \u00b1 7.3 in the resection group, 82.7 months \u00b1 5.3 in the TACE group, and 79.3 months \u00b1 10.8 in the local ablation group; P = .83). Local tumor progression after previous local ablation (10 of 35 [28.6%]) was higher than that after previous hepatectomy (15 of 134 [11.2%], P = .04). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that tumor size (hazard ratio, 1.58; 95% CI: 1.06, 2.36; P = .02), portal hypertension (hazard ratio, 1.52; 95% CI: 1.03, 2.26; P = .04), Child-Pugh class (hazard ratio, 2.01; 95% CI: 1.02, 3.96; P = .045), and serum \u03b1-fetoprotein level (hazard ratio, 1.62; 95% CI: 1.10, 2.39; P = .01) were independent predictive factors for recurrent HCC outcomes. Conclusion Radiofrequency ablation provides similar long-term survival for solitary hepatocellular carcinoma of 5 cm or less, regardless of whether treatment is initial or salvage therapy. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Background Deep learning (DL) algorithms could improve the classification of ovarian tumors assessed with multimodal US. Purpose To develop DL algorithms for the automated classification of benign versus malignant ovarian tumors assessed with US and to compare algorithm performance to Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System (O-RADS) and subjective expert assessment for malignancy. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included consecutive women with ovarian tumors undergoing gray scale and color Doppler US from January 2019 to November 2019. Histopathologic analysis was the reference standard. The data set was divided into training (70%), validation (10%), and test (20%) sets. Algorithms modified from residual network (ResNet) with two fusion strategies (feature fusion [hereafter, DLfeature] or decision fusion [hereafter, DLdecision]) were developed. DL prediction of malignancy was compared with O-RADS risk categorization and expert assessment by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis in the test set. Results A total of 422 women (mean age, 46.4 years \u00b1 14.8 [SD]) with 304 benign and 118 malignant tumors were included; there were 337 women in the training and validation data set and 85 women in the test data set. DLfeature had an AUC of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.97) for classifying malignant from benign ovarian tumors, comparable with O-RADS (AUC, 0.92; 95% CI: 0.85, 0.97; P = .88) and expert assessment (AUC, 0.97; 95% CI: 0.91, 0.99; P = .07), and similar to DLdecision (AUC, 0.90; 95% CI: 0.82, 0.96; P = .29). DLdecision, DLfeature, O-RADS, and expert assessment achieved sensitivities of 92%, 92%, 92%, and 96%, respectively, and specificities of 80%, 85%, 89%, and 87%, respectively, for malignancy. Conclusion Deep learning algorithms developed by using multimodal US images may distinguish malignant from benign ovarian tumors with diagnostic performance comparable to expert subjective and Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System assessment. \u00a9 RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Background Multidetector CT (MDCT) enables rapid and accurate diagnosis of head and neck (HN) injuries in patients with blunt trauma (BT). However, MDCT is overused, and appropriate selection of patients for imaging could improve workflow. Purpose To investigate the effect of implementing clinical triaging algorithms on use of MDCT in the HN in patients who have sustained BT. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, patients aged 15 years or older with BT admitted between October 28, 2007, and December 31, 2013, were included. Patients were divided into pre- and postalgorithm groups. The institutional trauma registry and picture archiving and communication system reports were reviewed to determine which patients underwent MDCT of the head, MDCT of the cervical spine (CS), and MDCT angiography of the HN at admission and whether these examinations yielded positive results. Injury Severity Score, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (only those patients in the intensive care unit), length of hospital stay (LOS), length of intensive care unit stay (ICULOS), and mortality were obtained from the trauma registry. Results A total of 8999 patients (mean age, 45 years \u00b1 20 [standard deviation]; age range, 15\u2013101 years; 6027 male) were included in this study. A lower percentage of the postalgorithm group versus the prealgorithm group underwent MDCT of the head (55.8% [2774 of 4969 patients]; 95% CI: 54.4, 57.2 vs 64.2% [2589 of 4030 patients]; 95% CI: 62.8, 65.7; P < .001) and CS (49.4% [2452 of 4969 patients]; 95% CI: 48.0, 50.7 vs 60.5% [2438 of 4030 patients]; 95% CI: 59.0, 62.0; P < .001) but not MDCT angiography of the HN (9.7% [480 of 4969 patients]; 95% CI: 8.9, 10.5 vs 9.8% [393 of 4030 patients]; 95% CI: 8.9, 10.7; P > .99). Pre- versus postalgorithm groups did not differ in LOS (mean, 4.8 days \u00b1 7.1 vs 4.5 days \u00b1 7.1, respectively; P = .42), ICULOS (mean, 4.6 days \u00b1 6.6 vs 4.8 days \u00b1 6.7, respectively; P > .99), or mortality (2.9% [118 of 4030 patients]; 95% CI: 2.5, 3.5; vs 2.8% [141 of 4969 patients]; 95% CI: 2.4, 3.3; respectively; P > .99).

        "History A 50-year-old woman presented to the emergency department of our hospital with a 2-day history of lower limb pain associated with unusual asthenia and diffuse arthralgia over the past 3 weeks. She was a native of Guinea and had lived in France for most of her life, working as a personal care assistant. Her only medical history of note was an occurrence of fetal death at 12 weeks gestation when she was 35 years old. She had bilateral lower limb swelling, without changes in skin temperature or color. All proximal and distal arterial pulses were felt. General physical examination findings were otherwise unremarkable. Her laboratory tests showed a decreased hemoglobin concentration of 8.9 g/dL (normal range, 12\u201316 g/dL), a decreased platelet count of 45 \u00d7 109/L (normal range, 150\u2013400 \u00d7 109/L), a C-reactive protein level of 158 mg/L (normal range, <5 mg/L) and a d-dimer level of 2000 mg/L (normal range, <500 mg/L). Compression US of the lower limbs revealed bilateral calf vein thrombosis involving the fibular and posterior tibial veins. Curative anticoagulation using low-molecular-weight heparin (enoxaparin, subcutaneous injection of 100 units per kilogram of body weight twice a day) was started. The day after the start of anticoagulation therapy, the patient reported dyspnea and acute chest and abdominal pain. Her vital signs were assessed, and she had elevated blood pressure and increased heart rate and respiratory rate, but she remained afebrile. Her cardiac auscultation was unremarkable, besides tachycardia. Skin examination revealed small areas of necrosis on the fingertips of her right hand. Laboratory studies were repeated and showed an increase in serum creatinine level from a baseline value of 0.49 mg/dL to a new value of 1.01 mg/dL (normal range, 0.6\u20131.1 mg/dL), an apparition of low-grade proteinuria of 0.43 g per day (normal range, <0.3 g/day), and a high serum troponin level of 1066 ng/L (normal range, <14 ng/L), whereas electrocardiography showed no ST segment modification and echocardiography revealed a moderately altered left ventricular ejection fraction (45%). There was no coronary occlusion seen at emergency coronarography. Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed (Figs 1, 2) together with cardiac MRI (Figs 3, 4).",
        "Purpose To evaluate whether dual-selectin\u2013targeted US molecular imaging allows longitudinal monitoring of anti-inflammatory treatment effects in an acute terminal ileitis model in swine. Materials and Methods The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all animal studies. Fourteen swine with chemically induced acute terminal ileitis (day 0) were randomized into the following groups: (a) an anti-inflammatory treatment group (n = 8; meloxicam, 0.25 mg per kilogram of body weight; prednisone, 0.5 mg/kg) and (b) a control group (n = 6; saline). US molecular imaging was performed with a clinical US machine after intravenous injection of clinically translatable dual P- and E-selectin\u2013targeted microbubbles (5 \u00d7 108/kg). Three inflamed bowel segments per swine were imaged at baseline, as well as on days 1, 3, and 6 after treatment initiation. At day 6, bowel segments were analyzed ex vivo for selectin expression levels by using quantitative immunofluorescence. Results After induction of inflammation, US molecular imaging signal increased at day 1 in both animal groups (P < .001). At day 3, signal in the treatment group decreased (P < .001 vs day 1), while signal in control animals did not significantly change (P = .18 vs day 1) and was higher (P = .001) compared with that in the treatment group. At day 6, signal in the treatment group further decreased and remained lower (P = .02) compared with that in the control group. Immunofluorescence confirmed significant (P \u2264 .04) downregulation of both P- and E-selectin expression levels in treated versus control bowel segments. Conclusion Dual-selectin\u2013targeted US molecular imaging allows longitudinal monitoring of anti-inflammatory treatment effects in a large-animal model of acute ileitis. This supports further clinical development of this quantitative and radiation-free technique for monitoring inflammatory bowel disease. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "A 40-year-old woman presented to the outpatient department of our hospital with a 2-year history of abdominal pain, which had worsened in the past few days. There were no other constitutional symptoms; in particular, there was no weight loss or loss of appetite. The serum amylase and serum lipase levels were always within normal limits, even during the current episode. There was no history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, drug use, or trauma. The patient was evaluated at an outside clinic 2 years ago and underwent imaging, including US and dedicated pancreatic CT, which revealed a complex multiseptated noncalcified pancreatic cystic lesion. After CT, the patient underwent endoscopic US, which showed the lesion was suspected to be an infected parasitic cyst; fine-needle aspiration and cytology were not attempted due to the risk of iatrogenic rupture. The patient was advised to undergo surgical resection but declined the procedure and was lost to follow-up for 2 years before her current visit to our facility. On clinical examination, there were no clinically important findings, aside from mild to moderate pain on deep palpation and some shifting dullness that was suggestive of ascites. The patient always remained hemodynamically stable. US-guided ascitic fluid analysis was performed, which revealed amylase levels of 869 IU/L (normal range, 4-234 IU/L). Considering prior CT and endoscopic US reports, the patient was further evaluated with a pancreatic MRI protocol for lesion characterization and to explain the new-onset abdominal pain (Figs 1, 2).",
        "Purpose To investigate whether low graft attenuation at unenhanced computed tomography (CT) is associated with 1-month mortality or graft failure after liver transplant and determine its diagnostic performance. Materials and Methods Included were 663 recipients who underwent CT imaging within 7 days after liver transplant between December 2014 and August 2016. Initial poor function (IPF) was diagnosed by using a combination of laboratory values within 7 days after liver transplant and subdivided patients into primary and secondary IPF. At 1 month after the operation, mortality and graft failure or survival in recipients was categorized. Two radiologists who were blinded to clinical data retrospectively and independently evaluated graft attenuation on unenhanced CT images (high or isoattenuation, graft attenuation greater than or equal to that of spleen; low, graft attenuation less than that of spleen). The interobserver agreement was evaluated by using intraclass correlation coefficient and \u03ba statics. Incidence of low graft attenuation between recipients with IPF and those with normal function was compared by using \u03c72 test. The relationship between graft attenuation and outcome in primary and secondary IPF was evaluated by using log-rank test. Results Of 663 recipients, 114 had IPF (80 primary; 34 secondary). After 1 month, 11 had graft failure or died, whereas 652 survived. Low graft attenuation was more common in patients with IPF than in normal-function patients (P < .001). In the primary group (those without identifiable cause), 15 patients had low graft attenuation, which led to mortality or graft failure within 1 month in seven of those patients. No recipient with high or isoattenuation had 1-month mortality or graft failure (P < .001). The secondary group (those with identifiable cause) showed no significant association between graft attenuation and 1-month mortality and graft failure (P = .181). Values of low graft attenuation for 1-month mortality and graft failure in primary IPF were positive predictive value, 46.7%; negative predictive value, 100%; sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 89.0%; and accuracy, 90.0%. There was excellent interobserver agreement in the assessment of graft attenuation (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.957; \u03ba = 1.00). Conclusion Low graft attenuation can be associated with 1-month mortality or graft failure in liver graft recipients with primary IPF. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017.",
        "Purpose To compare the performance of a deep-learning bone age assessment model based on hand radiographs with that of expert radiologists and that of existing automated models. Materials and Methods The institutional review board approved the study. A total of 14 036 clinical hand radiographs and corresponding reports were obtained from two children's hospitals to train and validate the model. For the first test set, composed of 200 examinations, the mean of bone age estimates from the clinical report and three additional human reviewers was used as the reference standard. Overall model performance was assessed by comparing the root mean square (RMS) and mean absolute difference (MAD) between the model estimates and the reference standard bone ages. Ninety-five percent limits of agreement were calculated in a pairwise fashion for all reviewers and the model. The RMS of a second test set composed of 913 examinations from the publicly available Digital Hand Atlas was compared with published reports of an existing automated model. Results The mean difference between bone age estimates of the model and of the reviewers was 0 years, with a mean RMS and MAD of 0.63 and 0.50 years, respectively. The estimates of the model, the clinical report, and the three reviewers were within the 95% limits of agreement. RMS for the Digital Hand Atlas data set was 0.73 years, compared with 0.61 years of a previously reported model. Conclusion A deep-learning convolutional neural network model can estimate skeletal maturity with accuracy similar to that of an expert radiologist and to that of existing automated models. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 An earlier incorrect version of this article appeared online.

        "Background Opening of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) induced with MRI-guided focused ultrasound has been shown in experimental animal models to reduce amyloid-\u03b2 plaque burden, improve memory performance, and facilitate delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain. However, physiologic effects of this procedure in humans with Alzheimer disease (AD) require further investigation. Purpose To assess imaging effects of focused ultrasound\u2013induced BBB opening in the hippocampus of human participants with early AD and to evaluate fluid flow patterns after BBB opening by using serial contrast-enhanced MRI. Materials and Methods Study participants with early AD recruited to a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act\u2013compliant, prospective, ongoing phase II clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT03671889) underwent three separate focused ultrasound\u2013induced BBB opening procedures that used a 220-kHz transducer with a concomitant intravenous microbubble contrast agent administered at 2-week intervals targeting the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex between October 2018 and May 2019. Posttreatment effects and gadolinium-based contrast agent enhancement patterns were evaluated by using 3.0-T MRI. Results Three women (aged 61, 72, and 73 years) consecutively enrolled in the trial successfully completed repeated focused ultrasound\u2013induced BBB opening of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Postprocedure contrast enhancement was clearly identified within the targeted brain volumes, indicating immediate spatially precise BBB opening. Parenchymal enhancement resolved within 24 hours after all treatments, confirming BBB closure. Transient perivenous enhancement was consistently observed during the acute phase after BBB opening. Notably, contrast enhancement reappeared in the perivenular regions after BBB closure. This imaging marker is consistent with blood-meningeal barrier permeability and persisted for 24\u201348 hours before spontaneous resolution. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or other adverse effect was identified. Conclusion MRI-guided focused ultrasound\u2013induced blood-brain barrier opening was safely performed in the hippocampi of three participants with Alzheimer disease without any adverse effects. Posttreatment MRI reveals a unique spatiotemporal contrast enhancement pattern that suggests a perivenular immunologic healing response downstream from targeted sites. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Background The biologic meaning of prognostic radiomics phenotypes remains poorly understood, hampered in part by lack of multicenter reproducible evidence. Purpose To uncover the biologic meaning of individual prognostic radiomics phenotypes in glioblastomas using paired MRI and RNA sequencing data and to validate the reproducibility of the identified radiogenomics linkages externally. Materials and Methods This retrospective multicenter study included four data sets gathered between January 2015 and December 2016. From a radiomics analysis set, a 13-feature radiomics signature was built using preoperative MRI for overall survival prediction. Using a radiogenomics training set with both MRI and RNA sequencing, biologic pathways were enriched and correlated with each of the 13 radiomics phenotypes. Radiomics-correlated key genes were identified to derive a prognostic radiomics gene expression (RadGene) score. The reproducibility of identified pathways and genes was validated with an external test set and a public data set (The Cancer Genome Atlas [TCGA]). A log-rank test was performed to assess prognostic significance. Results A total of 435 patients (mean age, 55 years \u00b1 15 [standard deviation]; 263 men) were enrolled. The radiomics signature was associated with overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 3.68; 95% CI: 2.08, 6.52; P < .001) in the radiomics validation subset. Four types of prognostic radiomics phenotypes were correlated with distinct pathways: immune, proliferative, treatment responsive, and cellular functions (false-discovery rate < 0.10). Thirty radiomics-correlated genes were identified. The prognostic significance of the RadGene score was confirmed in an external test set (HR, 2.02; 95% CI: 1.19, 3.41; P = .01) and a TCGA test set (HR, 1.43; 95% CI: 1.001, 2.04; P = .048). The radiomics-associated pathways and key genes can be replicated in an external test set. Conclusion Individual radiomics phenotypes on MRI scans predictive of overall survival were driven by distinct key pathways involved in immune regulation, tumor proliferation, treatment responses, and cellular functions in glioblastoma, which could be reproduced externally. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Background CT of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 disease depicts the extent of lung involvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Purpose To determine the value of quantification of the well-aerated lung (WAL) obtained at admission chest CT to determine prognosis in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Materials and Methods Imaging of patients admitted at the emergency department between February 17 and March 10, 2020 who underwent chest CT were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with negative results of reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at nasal-pharyngeal swabbing, negative chest CT findings, and incomplete clinical data were excluded. CT images were analyzed for quantification of WAL visually (%V-WAL), with open-source software (%S-WAL), and with absolute volume (VOL-WAL). Clinical parameters included patient characteristics, comorbidities, symptom type and duration, oxygen saturation, and laboratory values. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship between clinical parameters and CT metrics versus patient outcome (intensive care unit [ICU] admission or death vs no ICU admission or death). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated to determine model performance. Results The study included 236 patients (59 of 123 [25%] were female; median age, 68 years). A %V-WAL less than 73% (odds ratio [OR], 5.4; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.7, 10.8; P < .001), %S-WAL less than 71% (OR, 3.8; 95% CI: 1.9, 7.5; P < .001), and VOL-WAL less than 2.9 L (OR, 2.6; 95% CI: 1.2, 5.8; P < .01) were predictors of ICU admission or death. In comparison with clinical models containing only clinical parameters (AUC = 0.83), all three quantitative models showed better diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.86 for all models). The models containing %V-WAL less than 73% and VOL-WAL less than 2.9 L were superior in terms of performance as compared with the models containing only clinical parameters (P = .04 for both models).

        "The Fleischner Society Guidelines for management of solid nodules were published in 2005, and separate guidelines for subsolid nodules were issued in 2013. Since then, new information has become available; therefore, the guidelines have been revised to reflect current thinking on nodule management. The revised guidelines incorporate several substantive changes that reflect current thinking on the management of small nodules. The minimum threshold size for routine follow-up has been increased, and recommended follow-up intervals are now given as a range rather than as a precise time period to give radiologists, clinicians, and patients greater discretion to accommodate individual risk factors and preferences. The guidelines for solid and subsolid nodules have been combined in one simplified table, and specific recommendations have been included for multiple nodules. These guidelines represent the consensus of the Fleischner Society, and as such, they incorporate the opinions of a multidisciplinary international group of thoracic radiologists, pulmonologists, surgeons, pathologists, and other specialists. Changes from the previous guidelines issued by the Fleischner Society are based on new data and accumulated experience. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Purpose To reduce radiotracer requirements for amyloid PET/MRI without sacrificing diagnostic quality by using deep learning methods. Materials and Methods Forty data sets from 39 patients (mean age \u00b1 standard deviation [SD], 67 years \u00b1 8), including 16 male patients and 23 female patients (mean age, 66 years \u00b1 6 and 68 years \u00b1 9, respectively), who underwent simultaneous amyloid (fluorine 18 [18F]\u2013florbetaben) PET/MRI examinations were acquired from March 2016 through October 2017 and retrospectively analyzed. One hundredth of the raw list-mode PET data were randomly chosen to simulate a low-dose (1%) acquisition. Convolutional neural networks were implemented with low-dose PET and multiple MR images (PET-plus-MR model) or with low-dose PET alone (PET-only) as inputs to predict full-dose PET images. Quality of the synthesized images was evaluated while Bland-Altman plots assessed the agreement of regional standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) between image types. Two readers scored image quality on a five-point scale (5 = excellent) and determined amyloid status (positive or negative). Statistical analyses were carried out to assess the difference of image quality metrics and reader agreement and to determine confidence intervals (CIs) for reading results. Results The synthesized images (especially from the PET-plus-MR model) showed marked improvement on all quality metrics compared with the low-dose image. All PET-plus-MR images scored 3 or higher, with proportions of images rated greater than 3 similar to those for the full-dose images (\u221210% difference [eight of 80 readings], 95% CI: \u221215%, \u22125%). Accuracy for amyloid status was high (71 of 80 readings [89%]) and similar to intrareader reproducibility of full-dose images (73 of 80 [91%]). The PET-plus-MR model also had the smallest mean and variance for SUVR difference to full-dose images. Conclusion Simultaneously acquired MRI and ultra\u2013low-dose PET data can be used to synthesize full-dose\u2013like amyloid PET images. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

Purpose To determine if the rate of barotrauma in patients with COVID-19 infection was greater than in other patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation at the authors' institution. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, clinical and imaging data of patients seen between March 1, 2020, and April 6, 2020, who tested positive for COVID-19 and experienced barotrauma associated with invasive mechanical ventilation, were compared with patients without COVID-19 infection during the same period. Historical comparison was made to barotrauma rates of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome from February 1, 2016, to February 1, 2020, at the authors' institution. Comparison of patient groups was performed using categoric or continuous statistical testing as appropriate, with multivariable regression analysis. Patient survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves analysis. Results A total of 601 patients with COVID-19 infection underwent invasive mechanical ventilation (mean age, 63 years \u00b1 15 [standard deviation]; 71% men). Of the total, there were 89 (15%) patients with one or more barotrauma events for a total of 145 barotrauma events (24% overall events) (95% confidence interval [CI]: 21%, 28%). During the same period, 196 patients without COVID-19 infection (mean age, 64 years \u00b1 19; 52% men) with invasive mechanical ventilation had one barotrauma event (0.5%; 95% CI: 0%, 3%;",
        "Background There currently is no consensus on the optimal localization procedure and imaging protocol for parathyroid adenoma. Parathyroid four-dimensional (4D) CT has emerged as a promising method for preoperative localization. Purpose To evaluate the diagnostic performance of parathyroid 4D CT and technetium 99m-sestamibi (hereafter, referred to as sestamibi) SPECT/CT in preoperative localization in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Materials and Methods This was a single-institution retrospective study of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism who underwent a combined imaging protocol of sestamibi SPECT/CT and 4D CT (noncontrast, contrast agent-enhanced, arterial, and delayed venous phases) acquired in a single setting from February 2013 to May 2016, with subsequent parathyroidectomy within 6 months. Reference standard for correct localization was on the basis of location denoted on operative reports, with pathologic confirmation of parathyroid adenoma or hyperplasia. By using a four-quadrant analysis, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) for localization of the hyperfunctioning parathyroid gland or glands at sestamibi SPECT/CT and 4D CT were compared, per modality and in combination. Results Four hundred patients (319 women, 81 men; mean age, 61 years \u00b1 14 [standard deviation]) were evaluated. Similar diagnostic performance was found in both combined 4D CT with sestamibi SPECT/CT and 4D CT alone (area under the curve [AUC], 0.88 [95% CI: 0.86, 0.90] and 0.87 [95% CI: 0.85, 0.90], respectively; P = .82). Both modalities outperformed sestamibi SPECT/CT (AUC, 0.78; 95% CI: 0.76, 0.81; P < .001). Four-dimensional CT showed higher sensitivity than did sestamibi SPECT/CT (sensitivity, 79.3% [414 of 522] vs 58.0% [303 of 522], respectively; P < .001). In a subset analysis, 4D CT had higher sensitivity than sestamibi SPECT/CT in patients with single-gland disease (sensitivity, 92.5% [297 of 321] vs 75.1% [241 of 321], respectively; P < .001) and with multigland disease (sensitivity, 58.2% [117 of 201] vs 30.8% [62 of 201], respectively; P < .001). Conclusion Four-dimensional CT provided superior preoperative localization compared with sestamibi SPECT/CT in patients with single and multigland disease. The combination of the two modalities did not improve diagnostic performance compared with four-dimensional CT alone. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has widely spread all over the world since the beginning of 2020. It is desirable to develop automatic and accurate detection of COVID-19 using chest CT. Purpose To develop a fully automatic framework to detect COVID-19 using chest CT and evaluate its performance. Materials and Methods In this retrospective and multicenter study, a deep learning model, the COVID-19 detection neural network (COVNet), was developed to extract visual features from volumetric chest CT scans for the detection of COVID-19. CT scans of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and other non-pneumonia abnormalities were included to test the robustness of the model. The datasets were collected from six hospitals between August 2016 and February 2020. Diagnostic performance was assessed with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, and specificity. Results The collected dataset consisted of 4352 chest CT scans from 3322 patients. The average patient age (\u00b1standard deviation) was 49 years \u00b1 15, and there were slightly more men than women (1838 vs 1484, respectively; P = .29). The per-scan sensitivity and specificity for detecting COVID-19 in the independent test set was 90% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 83%, 94%; 114 of 127 scans) and 96% (95% CI: 93%, 98%; 294 of 307 scans), respectively, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.96 (P < .001). The per-scan sensitivity and specificity for detecting CAP in the independent test set was 87% (152 of 175 scans) and 92% (239 of 259 scans), respectively, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.97). Conclusion A deep learning model can accurately detect coronavirus 2019 and differentiate it from community-acquired pneumonia and other lung conditions. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Background Subdural hemorrhage (SDH) is thought to have a benign course in asymptomatic neonates. However, effects on neurodevelopmental outcomes have not been established. Purpose To evaluate neurodevelopmental outcomes, gray matter volumes, and MRI findings in asymptomatic neonates with SDH compared with control neonates. Materials and Methods This retrospective analysis was conducted between 2003 and 2016 and was based on data from the University of North Carolina Early Brain Development Study. Neurodevelopmental outcomes were evaluated at 2 years of age by using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL). All infants were imaged with 3.0-T MRI machines and were evaluated for SDH at baseline (neonates) and at ages 1 and 2 years. Volumetric MRI for brain segmentation was performed at ages 1 and 2 years. A secondary analysis was performed in neonates matched 1:1 with control neonates. Differences in categorical variables were measured by using the Fisher exact test, and the",
        "This case series examines cardiac MRI findings in four children and adolescents admitted to intensive care in April 2020 for multisystem inflammatory syndrome and Kawasaki disease\u2013like features related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Acute myocarditis occurred less than 1 week after onset of fever and gastrointestinal symptoms. Physical examination showed rash and cheilitis or conjunctivitis. All patients recovered after intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was negative in nasopharyngeal, stool, and respiratory samples and was positive on serology. Cardiac MRI showed diffuse myocardial edema on T2 short tau inversion-recovery sequences and native T1 mapping, with no evidence of late gadolinium enhancement suggestive of replacement fibrosis or focal necrosis. These findings favor postinfectious myocarditis in children and adolescents with COVID-19. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "History Part one of this case appeared 4 months previously and may contain larger images. A 32-year-old woman presented to an ophthalmologist for bilateral blurry vision. She underwent MRI of the brain and orbits, which showed a focal abnormality within the pituitary gland. The patient was referred to an endocrinologist for further evaluation. Review of systems and physical examination by the endocrinologist revealed no symptoms or signs of endocrine dysfunction. Anterior pituitary hormone levels, including growth hormone, prolactin, thyroid stimulating hormone, follicular-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and adrenocorticotropic hormone, were normal. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI of the sella and pituitary gland and subsequent CT of the anterior skull base were performed.",
        "History A 68-year-old man with a remote history of a previously resected high-grade urothelial carcinoma in the renal pelvis was being observed and was undergoing urologic treatment for recurrent low-grade urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. During his most recent evaluation, he reported no specific symptoms and denied experiencing hematuria, dysuria, or abdominal pain. At routine surveillance MRI of the abdomen and pelvis (images not shown), a lesion was noted in the peripheral zone of the prostate gland. The prostate-specific antigen level was elevated (7.51 ng/mL [normal range, 0.00\u20134.00 ng/mL]). The patient had no family history of prostate cancer and had never undergone prostate biopsy. MRI of the prostate with an endorectal coil was subsequently performed.",
        "History A 28-year-old man presented with lifelong anejaculation, which had become an issue because of family planning. The patient had a history of normal erections and experienced the sensation of orgasm without ever ejaculating. On physical examination, both testes were present in the scrotum, with normal dimensions and a normal epididymis bilaterally. The patient had a slightly tender left testicle, and digital rectal examination findings were normal. The patient underwent further investigation for the possibility of retrograde ejaculation with urine cytology, the results of which were negative. Genetic testing was performed to exclude Y chromosome microdeletions. Serum-luteinizing and follicle-stimulating hormone levels were normal, with a borderline low level of testosterone (7.6 nmol/L; normal range, 8.0-29.0 nmol/L). All other pertinent laboratory results were noncontributory. Pelvic MRI was requested to exclude an anatomic cause of anejaculation. MRI was performed in accordance with the standard clinical prostate protocol, with a dynamic contrast material-enhanced study. CT of the upper abdomen was also performed. The patient subsequently underwent cystoscopy, which revealed an intravesicular fluid-filled mass near the left ureteric orifice.",
        "A 54-year-old man was found by paramedics in his home face-down at his computer desk with a substantially reduced level of consciousness. He had not contacted his family for more than 50 hours. The patient lived alone and was a heavy smoker with a history of alcohol abuse. His medical history was otherwise unremarkable, and there was no history of cancer, psoriasis, or rheumatoid arthritis, nor was there a history of methotrexate administration. At presentation to the emergency department, he was mildly hypotensive and was experiencing hypercapnic respiratory failure and acute renal failure with rhabdomyolysis. His toxicology screen was mildly positive for opiates. He received naloxone (Narcan; Emergent) with minimal effect. An unenhanced CT scan of the head was obtained. Of note, this patient's presentation predated the COVID-19 pandemic. He was admitted to the intensive care unit for decreased level of consciousness and respiratory failure. The decreased level of consciousness was thought to be secondary to seizure, as he developed seizurelike movements prior to intubation, probably in the context of intoxication or alcohol withdrawal. Electroencephalography revealed moderate bilateral cerebral dysfunction and encephalopathy, with no evidence of nonconvulsive seizures. He had a short course of intermittent hemodialysis and was discharged home 8 days later with an appointment for neurology follow-up. At discharge, he was at his cognitive and functional baseline. Approximately 3 weeks later, the patient was brought back to the emergency department for progressive confusion and decrease in balance. He became apathetic with reduced psychomotor activity and was no longer able to perform basic daily activities, such as cooking or bathing. He displayed bizarre behavior, such as staring at a wall for hours, and was somnolent, irritable, and inattentive. He eventually became incontinent of urine and stool. Results of a neurologic examination of the cranial nerves, motor function, sensation, and reflexes were normal. The results of blood work-up were grossly normal, and the results of an extensive toxicology work-up were negative. Repeat head CT was performed. MRI was ordered to further investigate the patient's encephalopathic presentation.",
        "Purpose To develop diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) and achievable doses (ADs) for the 10 most common adult computed tomographic (CT) examinations in the United States as a function of patient size by using the CT Dose Index Registry. Materials and Methods Data from the 10 most commonly performed adult CT head, neck, and body examinations from 583 facilities were analyzed. For head examinations, the lateral thickness was used as an indicator of patient size; for neck and body examinations, water-equivalent diameter was used. Data from 1 310 727 examinations (analyzed by using SAS 9.3) provided median values, as well as means and 25th and 75th (DRL) percentiles for volume CT dose index (CTDIvol), dose-length product (DLP), and size-specific dose estimate (SSDE). Applicable results were compared with DRLs from eight countries. Results More than 46% of the facilities were community hospitals; 13% were academic facilities. More than 48% were in metropolitan areas, 39% were suburban, and 13% were rural. More than 50% of the facilities performed fewer than 500 examinations per month. The abdomen and pelvis was the most frequently performed examination in the study (45%). For body examinations, DRLs (75th percentile) and ADs (median) for CTDIvol, SSDE, and DLP increased consistently with the patient's size (water-equivalent diameter). The relationships between patient size and DRLs and ADs were not as strong for head and neck examinations. These results agree well with the data from other countries. Conclusion DRLs and ADs as a function of patient size were developed for the 10 most common adult CT examinations performed in the United States. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017.",
        "History In November 2012, a previously healthy 31-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with a 2-month history of right-sided numbness, diplopia, and intermittent nausea and dizziness. She did not have a history of fever, weight loss, headache, photophobia, seizure, or extremity weakness. Physical examination revealed left abduction limitation and right-sided hypoesthesia. Kernig and Brudzinski signs were absent, and pathergy test results were negative. Laboratory evaluation revealed normal complete and differential blood counts, normal serum chemistry, and normal immune function. Analysis of her serum was negative for antiaquaporin 4 antibody, rheumatism antibody profile, and paraneoplastic profile. Serum analysis was also negative for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and 2 RNA, hepatitis B and C antigen or antibody profile, and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed clear fluid, a normal glucose level, an elevated protein level (45 mg/dL; normal range, 20-40 mg/dL), and an elevated white blood cell count (10/mm3 [0.01 \u00d7109/L]; normal range, 0-8/mm3 [{0-0.008} \u00d7109/L]; 81% lymphocytes, 19% monocytes). No CSF-specific oligoclonal bands were detected. Gram staining, acid-fast staining, and lactic acid and cryptococcal antigen test results were negative. CSF did not grow any bacteria, fungus, or acid-fast bacillus at culture. Spinal cord MRI, brain MR angiography, and CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed normal findings (images not shown). Brain MRI and gadolinium-enhanced (20 mL gadopentetate dimeglumine, BeiLu Pharmaceutical, Beijing, China) MRI were performed ( Fig 1 ). The patient's clinical symptoms and imaging findings responded to treatment with a high dose of steroids. However, the patient's symptoms exhibited clinical and radiologic progression as she attempted to taper the steroid dose. She arbitrarily stopped taking the steroids and started traditional Chinese treatment instead. However, her condition was not controlled. [Figure: see text][Figure: see text][Figure: see text] In November 2013, she was readmitted with worsening dizziness and diplopia accompanied by hearing loss, tinnitus, slurred speech, drinking-induced cough, walking instability, and involuntary outbursts of laughter and crying. Dysmetria, ataxia, brisk tendon reflexes, pathologic reflexes, and pseudobulbar signs were observed bilaterally. Repeated biochemical and immune tests did not yield positive findings. CSF analysis revealed mild lymphocytic pleocytosis (white blood cell count, 8/mm3 [0.008 \u00d7109/L]; 83% lymphocytes, 17% monocytes) and a slightly elevated total protein level (46 mg/dL). Brain PET revealed diffuse high metabolism in the midbrain and pons (images not shown). Whole-body PET was negative for malignancy (images not shown). Brain MRI and gadolinium-enhanced MRI were performed ( Fig 2 ). The patient's clinical symptoms and imaging findings improved after treatment with a high dose of steroids. Thereafter, intravenous cyclophosphamide therapy was added after her condition deteriorated again when the prednisone dose was tapered to 20 mg per day in March 2014 ( Fig 3a ). Her pontocerebral symptoms were relatively stable in the following year, with apparent diminishment of lesions in the brainstem and cerebellum observed at brain PET (images not shown). Follow-up MR images were obtained in July 2014 ( Fig 3b ). Subsequently, the patient exhibited clinical and radiologic aggravation. MR images were obtained again in July 2015 ( Fig 4 ) and February 2016 ( Fig 5 ). The patient underwent biopsy of the right frontal lobe, and a histopathologic examination was performed in August 2015. Afterward, her condition worsened, and she died in September 2016.

        "Background The use of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) is linked to gadolinium retention in the skeleton of healthy individuals. The mechanism of gadolinium incorporation into bone tissue is not fully understood and requires spatially resolved analysis to locate the gadolinium. Purpose To compare the quantitative distribution of gadolinium retained over time in rodent femur following the administration of gadodiamide and gadobutrol at three different time points. Materials and Methods In this animal study conducted between May 2018 and April 2020, 108 9-week-old healthy rats were repeatedly injected with either gadodiamide, gadobutrol, or saline solution and were killed 1, 3, or 12 months after the last injection. The femurs of six female and six male rats per each group and time point were collected. Quantitative elemental imaging of gadolinium in longitudinal thin sections was performed on one sample per sex with use of laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Gadolinium concentration was determined with use of ICP-MS on the samples of all animals (six per group). Mann-Whitney U tests were applied on pairwise comparisons to determine potential sex effect and GBCA effect on gadolinium concentrations. Results The highest gadolinium retention was observed in the gadodiamide group (concentration, 97-200 nmol \u00b7 g-1), exceeding the mean concentration in the gadobutrol group (6.5-17 nmol \u00b7 g-1). However, the gadolinium distribution pattern was similar for both contrast agents, showing prominent gadolinium retention at endosteal surfaces, in the bone marrow, and in small tissue pores. Gadolinium distribution in cortical bone changed over time, initially showing a thin rim of higher concentration close to the periosteum, which appeared to grow wider and move toward the interior of the femur over 1 year. Conclusion For both gadolinium-based contrast agents, gadolinium retention in rat bone was initially located close to the periosteum and bone cavities and changed with bone remodeling processes. The relevance to long-term storage of gadolinium in humans remains to be determined. \u00a9 RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To evaluate the clinical performance of dual-agent relaxation contrast (DARC) magnetic resonance (MR) lymphangiography compared with that of conventional MR lymphangiography in the creation of isolated lymphatic maps in patients with secondary lymphedema. Materials and Methods This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board. The diagnostic quality of 42 DARC MR lymphangiographic studies was compared with that of 42 conventional MR lymphangiographic studies. Two independent readers rated venous contamination as absent, mild, or moderate to severe. Interreader agreement on venous contamination grades was assessed by using the linearly weighted Cohen \u03ba statistic. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the distribution of grades at each station between conventional MR lymphangiography and DARC MR lymphangiography for each reader separately. Results DARC MR lymphangiography had significantly less venous contamination than did conventional MR lymphangiography (P < .001). The two radiologists rated venous contamination as moderate to severe in 64% (27 of 42) and 69% (29 of 42) of distal limbs, 23% (10 of 42) of midlimbs, and 2% (one of 42) and 9% (four of 42) of proximal limbs at conventional MR lymphangiography compared with 0% (0 of 42) of distal limbs, 2% (one of 42) of midlimbs, and 0% (0 of 42) of proximal limbs at DARC MR lymphangiography. Lymphatic signal was partially attenuated (median 45% decrease) when longer echo times were used for venous suppression, but it did not subjectively degrade diagnostic quality. Conclusion DARC MR lymphangiography yields isolated lymphatic maps through nulling of venous contamination, thereby simplifying diagnostic interpretation and communication with surgical colleagues. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017.",
        "Background Early stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the ideal candidate for resection in patients with preserved liver function; however, cancer will recur in half of these patients and no reliable prognostic tool has been established. Purpose To investigate the effectiveness of radiomic features in predicting tumor recurrence after resection of early stage HCC. Materials and Methods In total, 295 patients (median age, 58 years; interquartile range, 50\u201365 years; 221 men) who underwent contrast material\u2013enhanced CT and curative resection for early stage HCC that met the Milan criteria between February 2009 and December 2016 were retrospectively recruited from three independent institutions. Follow-up consisted of serum \u03b1-fetoprotein level, liver function tests, and dynamic imaging examinations every 3 months during the first 2 years and then every 6 months thereafter. In the development cohort of 177 patients from institution 1, recurrence-related radiomic features were computationally extracted from the tumor and its periphery and a radiomics signature was built with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression. Two models, one integrating preoperative and one integrating pre- and postoperative variables, were created by using multivariable Cox regression analysis. An independent external cohort of 118 patients from institutions 2 and 3 was used to validate the proposed models. Results The preoperative model integrated radiomics signature with serum \u03b1-fetoprotein level and tumor number; the postoperative model incorporated microvascular invasion and satellite nodules into the above-mentioned predictors. In both study cohorts, two radiomics-based models provided better predictive performance (concordance index \u22650.77, P < .05 for all), lower prediction error (integrated Brier score \u22640.14), and larger net benefits, as determined by means of decision curve analysis, than rival models without radiomics and widely adopted staging systems. The radiomics-based models gave three risk strata with high, intermediate, or low risk of recurrence and distinct profiles of recurrent tumor number. Conclusion The proposed radiomics models with pre- and postresection features helped predict tumor recurrence for early stage hepatocellular carcinoma. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",

        "This is a condensed summary of an international multisociety statement on ethics of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology produced by the ACR, European Society of Radiology, RSNA, Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine, European Society of Medical Imaging Informatics, Canadian Association of Radiologists, and American Association of Physicists in Medicine. AI has great potential to increase efficiency and accuracy throughout radiology, but it also carries inherent pitfalls and biases. Widespread use of AI-based intelligent and autonomous systems in radiology can increase the risk of systemic errors with high consequence and highlights complex ethical and societal issues. Currently, there is little experience using AI for patient care in diverse clinical settings. Extensive research is needed to understand how to best deploy AI in clinical practice. This statement highlights our consensus that ethical use of AI in radiology should promote well-being, minimize harm, and ensure that the benefits and harms are distributed among stakeholders in a just manner. We believe AI should respect human rights and freedoms, including dignity and privacy. It should be designed for maximum transparency and dependability. Ultimate responsibility and accountability for AI remains with its human designers and operators for the foreseeable future. The radiology community should start now to develop codes of ethics and practice for AI that promote any use that helps patients and the common good and should block use of radiology data and algorithms for financial gain without those two attributes.

        "Purpose To develop and evaluate the feasibility of deep learning approaches for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging\u2013based attenuation correction (AC) (termed deep MRAC) in brain positron emission tomography (PET)/MR imaging. Materials and Methods A PET/MR imaging AC pipeline was built by using a deep learning approach to generate pseudo computed tomographic (CT) scans from MR images. A deep convolutional auto-encoder network was trained to identify air, bone, and soft tissue in volumetric head MR images coregistered to CT data for training. A set of 30 retrospective three-dimensional T1-weighted head images was used to train the model, which was then evaluated in 10 patients by comparing the generated pseudo CT scan to an acquired CT scan. A prospective study was carried out for utilizing simultaneous PET/MR imaging for five subjects by using the proposed approach. Analysis of covariance and paired-sample t tests were used for statistical analysis to compare PET reconstruction error with deep MRAC and two existing MR imaging\u2013based AC approaches with CT-based AC. Results Deep MRAC provides an accurate pseudo CT scan with a mean Dice coefficient of 0.971 \u00b1 0.005 for air, 0.936 \u00b1 0.011 for soft tissue, and 0.803 \u00b1 0.021 for bone. Furthermore, deep MRAC provides good PET results, with average errors of less than 1% in most brain regions. Significantly lower PET reconstruction errors were realized with deep MRAC (\u22120.7% \u00b1 1.1) compared with Dixon-based soft-tissue and air segmentation (\u22125.8% \u00b1 3.1) and anatomic CT-based template registration (\u22124.8% \u00b1 2.2). Conclusion The authors developed an automated approach that allows generation of discrete-valued pseudo CT scans (soft tissue, bone, and air) from a single high-spatial-resolution diagnostic-quality three-dimensional MR image and evaluated it in brain PET/MR imaging. This deep learning approach for MR imaging\u2013based AC provided reduced PET reconstruction error relative to a CT-based standard within the brain compared with current MR imaging\u2013based AC approaches. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "History A 21-year-old man presented with swelling of the medial aspect of the left thigh of 1-month duration. There was no history of fever or penetrating injury in the left thigh. The patient had undergone renal transplantation 7 years earlier and had been taking immunosuppressants since transplantation. He had undergone two surgeries at the same site in the medial aspect of the left thigh in the past 3 years for a similar problem. At physical examination, there was swelling in the medial aspect of the left thigh, with mild tenderness. A surgical scar was noted anterior to the swelling ( Fig 1 ). No redness or discharging sinus was present. Laboratory results were as follows: hemoglobin level, 11.3 g/dL (normal range, 13.8-17.2 g/dL); white blood cell count, 9.7 \u00d7 109/L (normal range, [4-11] \u00d7 109/L); neutrophil, 75% (normal range, 48%-77%); lymphocyte, 22% (normal range, 10%-24%); eosinophil, 1% (normal range, 0.3%- 7%); monocyte, 1% (normal range, 0.6%-10%); serum creatinine level, 1.3 mg/dL (114.9 \u03bcmol/L) (normal range, 0.5-1.6 mg/dL [44.2-141.4 \u03bcmol/L]); and serum glucose (random) level, 82 mg/dL (4.5 mmol/L) (normal range, 79-140 mg/dL [4.4-7.8 mmol/L]).

        "Introduction: Ocular volume measurement is essential for prompt diagnosis and management of eye diseases such as microphthalmos, buphthalmos, macrophthalmos, orbital tumours and refractive errors such as myopia and hypermetropia.Aims and Objective: To measure ocular volume in a population of Nigerian adults with B-mode ultrasonography and establish the range of normal ocular volumes in the population studied.Materials and Method: Four hundred subjects were scanned in this study using Sonoace X8 Ultrasound Machine (Medison, South Korea). Each subject eyeball volume was measured by B-mode ultrasonography. The ocular volumes were correlated with sex, age, height, and weight and body mass index. The data from the study was analyzed using statistical package for social science software version 17 (SPSS Inc, Chicago).Result: Of the 400 subjects evaluated, 56.3% were female. The mean age of the subjects was 36.67years \u00b1 10.84, while that of the male and female subjects were 36.46years \u00b1 11.32 and 36.93years \u00b1 10.46 respectively. The right ocular volume (ROV) was slightly larger than the left ocular volume (LOV) in both sexes [male: ROV=8.38cm3 \u00b1 0.57, LOV=8.31cm3 \u00b1 0.48; female: ROV=8.31cm3 \u00b1 0.58, LOV=8.21cm3 \u00b1 0.56], although the differences between the ocular volumes were not statistically significant in both genders [p>0.005]. Both eyeball increased in volume till fourth decade of life; right ocular volume increased till thirty-two years of age while left ocular volumes increased till forty-two years of age. Both ocular Volumes thereafter decreased gradually as age increased. The ocular volume correlated positively with the age and height, but negatively with the weight and body mass index in both genders.Conclusion: The ocular volume correlated positively with the age and height; and negatively with the weight and body mass index of the subjects. It was observed that males had slightlylarger eyeballs in comparison to females, and that right eyeball volume was larger than the left eyeball volume. The differences were not statistically significant.",
        "Purpose To test whether computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) approaches can increase the positive predictive value (PPV) and reduce the false-positive rate in lung cancer screening for small nodules compared with human reading by thoracic radiologists. Materials and Methods A matched case-control sample of low-dose computed tomography (CT) studies in 186 participants with 4\u201320-mm noncalcified lung nodules who underwent biopsy in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) was selected. Variables used for matching were age, sex, smoking status, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease status, body mass index, study year of the positive screening test, and screening results. Studies before lung biopsy were randomly split into a training set (70 cancers plus 70 benign controls) and a validation set (20 cancers plus 26 benign controls). Image features from within and outside dominant nodules were extracted. A CAD algorithm developed from the training set and a random forest classifier were applied to the validation set to predict biopsy outcomes. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to compare the prediction accuracy of CAD with the NLST investigator's diagnosis and readings from three experienced and board-certified thoracic radiologists who used contemporary clinical practice guidelines. Results In the validation cohort, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for CAD was 0.9154. By default, the sensitivity, specificity, and PPV of the NLST investigators were 1.00, 0.00, and 0.43, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and negative predictive value of CAD and the three radiologists' combined reading were 0.95, 0.88, 0.86, and 0.96 and 0.70, 0.69, 0.64, and 0.75, respectively. Conclusion CAD could increase PPV and reduce the false-positive rate in the early diagnosis of lung cancer. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "In this retrospective case series, chest CT scans of 21 symptomatic patients from China infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) were reviewed, with emphasis on identifying and characterizing the most common findings. Typical CT findings included bilateral pulmonary parenchymal ground-glass and consolidative pulmonary opacities, sometimes with a rounded morphology and a peripheral lung distribution. Notably, lung cavitation, discrete pulmonary nodules, pleural effusions, and lymphadenopathy were absent. Follow-up imaging in a subset of patients during the study time window often demonstrated mild or moderate progression of disease, as manifested by increasing extent and density of lung opacities. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020",
        "Background An extensive intraductal component (EIC) in breast cancer is an independent risk factor for local recurrence after surgery, especially in young, premenopausal women. Few studies have analyzed long-term outcomes or imaging features of EIC-positive breast cancer. Purpose To assess the prognostic value of EIC on recurrence-free and overall survival in breast cancer and evaluate imaging features of EIC-positive breast cancer by using mammography, US, and MRI. Materials and Methods A retrospective study of 6816 consecutive women with surgically diagnosed invasive breast cancer between January 2007 and December 2012 was performed. After individual matching, women were allocated into either an EIC-positive or an EIC-negative group. Imaging factors associated with prognosis were investigated. The recurrence-free and overall survival rates were compared. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to analyze the effect of EIC. Results Among 6136 included women (mean age, 48.9 years \u00b1 9.8), 1800 EIC-positive and 4336 EIC-negative breast cancers were identified. After matching according to EIC presence was performed, 1551 women were allocated into each group. The mean follow-up period was 79.9 months. The local-regional recurrence rate in the EIC-positive group was higher than that in the EIC-negative group (39.4% [63 of 160] vs 25.5% [37 of 145];",
        "Background Data on the long-term pulmonary sequelae in COVID-19 are lacking. Purpose To assess symptoms, functional impairment, and residual pulmonary abnormalities on serial chest CT scans in COVID-19 survivors discharged from hospital at up to 1-year follow-up. Materials and Methods Adult patients with COVID-19 discharged between March 2020 and June 2020 were prospectively evaluated at 3 months and 1 year through systematic assessment of symptoms, functional impairment, and thoracic CT scans as part of the PHENOTYPE study, an observational cohort study in COVID-19 survivors. Lung function testing was limited to participants with CT abnormalities and/or persistent breathlessness. Bonferroni correction was used. Results Eighty participants (mean age, 59 years \u00b1 13 [SD]; 53 men) were assessed. At outpatient review, persistent breathlessness was reported in 37 of the 80 participants (46%) and cough was reported in 17 (21%). CT scans in 73 participants after discharge (median, 105 days; IQR, 95-141 days) revealed persistent abnormalities in 41 participants (56%), with ground-glass opacification (35 of 73 participants [48%]) and bands (27 of 73 participants [37%]) predominating. Unequivocal signs indicative of established fibrosis (ie, volume loss and/or traction bronchiectasis) were present in nine of 73 participants (12%). Higher admission serum C-reactive protein (in milligrams per liter), fibrinogen (in grams per deciliter), urea (millimoles per liter), and creatinine (micromoles per liter) levels; longer hospital stay (in days); older age (in years); and requirement for invasive ventilation were associated with CT abnormalities at 3-month follow-up. Thirty-two of 41 participants (78%) with abnormal findings at 3-month follow-up CT underwent repeat imaging at a median of 364 days (range, 360-366 days), with 26 (81%) showing further radiologic improvement (median, 18%; IQR, 10%-40%). Conclusion CT abnormalities were common at 3 months after COVID-19 but with signs of fibrosis in a minority. More severe acute disease was linked with CT abnormalities at 3 months. However, radiologic improvement was seen in the majority at 1-year follow-up.

        "Purpose To assess the degree of cortical vein opacification in patients with internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke and to evaluate the relationship with treatment benefit from intra-arterial therapy (IAT). Materials and Methods Written informed consent was obtained from all patients in the Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands. From the trial's database, all patients (recruited from December 2010 until March 2014) with baseline computed tomographic (CT) angiograms were retrospectively included. Enhancement of the vein of Labb\u00e9, sphenoparietal sinus, and superficial middle cerebral vein was graded by one neuroradiologist, as follows: 0, not visible; 1, moderate opacification; and 2, full opacification. The sum for the ipsilateral hemisphere was calculated, resulting in the cortical vein opacification score (COVES) (range, 0\u20136). Primary outcome was the modified Rankin Scale score at 90 days. Association with treatment according to full cortical vein score and different dichotomized cutoff points was estimated with ordinal logistic regression. Interobserver agreement was assessed by two separate observers who reviewed 100 studies each. Results In total, 397 patients were analyzed. Interaction of the cortical vein score with treatment was significant (P = .044) when dichotomized COVES was 0 versus more than 0. The adjusted odds ratio for shift toward better functional outcome was 1.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.5, 2.0) for a COVES of 0 (n = 123) and 2.2 (95% CI: 1.6, 4.1) for a COVES greater than 0 (n = 274). The multirater \u03ba value was 0.73. Conclusion In this study, patients with acute middle cerebral artery stroke with absence of cortical vein opacification in the affected hemisphere (COVES = 0) appeared to have no benefit from IAT, whereas patients with venous opacification (COVES >0) were shown to benefit from IAT. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Clinical trial registration nos.

        "Purpose To determine whether texture features on pretreatment contrast material-enhanced computed tomographic (CT) images can help predict overall survival (OS) and time to progression (TTP) in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with sorafenib. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included 92 patients with advanced HCC treated with sorafenib between January 2009 and April 2015 at two independent university hospitals. Sixty-four of the 92 patients (70%) (six women, 58 men; median age, 66 years) were included from institution 1 and constituted a training cohort; 28 patients (30%) (five women, 23 men; median age, 64 years) were included from institution 2 and constituted a validation cohort. Pretreatment CT texture analysis was performed on late arterial and portal venous phase HCC images. Mean gray-level intensity, entropy, kurtosis, skewness, and standard deviation values were derived from the pixel distribution histogram before and after spatial filtration at different anatomic scales ranging from fine to coarse texture. Lesion heterogeneity was also visually graded on a 4-point scale. Correlations between visual analysis and texture parameters were assessed with the Spearman rank correlation. Univariate Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed in the training cohort to identify independent predictors of OS and TTP. Their predictive capacity was tested on the validation cohort by using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results Visual analysis of tumor heterogeneity correlated with entropy at both arterial (P = .012) and portal venous (P = .038) phases. Portal phase-derived entropy at fine (hazard ratio [HR], 5.08; P = .0033), medium (HR, 2.23; P = .019), and coarse (HR, 2.26; P = .0032) texture scales was identified as an independent predictor of OS and confirmed in the validation cohort (P < .05). The difference in median survival between patients in the validation cohort with entropy values below and above the identified threshold was 272 days (with fine texture) and 741 days (with medium and coarse textures). Arterial phase-derived texture parameters (P > .085) and visual analysis (P > .11) were not associated with changes in survival. Conclusion Pretreatment portal venous phase-derived tumor entropy may be a predictor of survival in patients with advanced HCC treated with sorafenib.",

        "Background Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) has improved the accuracy of mammography, including resolving many breast asymmetries as overlapping breast tissue. The pathologic outcomes of persistent developing asymmetries visualized at DBT are not well established. Purpose To characterize the outcomes and the predictors of malignancy for developing asymmetries visualized at DBT without a sonographic correlate. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included all tomosynthesis-guided biopsies of developing asymmetries performed at a single institution from May 2017 through January 2020. A reader study including three breast imaging radiologists determined interrater agreement and inclusion into the study. Electronic medical records were used to extract patient characteristics, imaging characteristics, and pathologic diagnoses. The Wilcoxon rank sum test, Fisher exact test, and \u03c72 test were used to analyze correlations of patient and imaging characteristics with likelihood of malignancy. Results The reader study included 95 DBT examinations with moderate interrater reliability (Fleiss \u03ba = 0.45). There was majority reader agreement in 85 of the 95 DBT examinations (89%) of 83 women (median age, 56 years; interquartile range, 47-69 years), and this finalized the study data set. At pathologic examination, most asymmetries (68 of 85, 80%) were benign, with common diagnoses being fibrocystic change (n = 20), stromal fibrosis (n = 10), and fat necrosis (n = 10). The overall malignancy rate was 20% (17 of 85 asymmetries; 95% CI: 12, 29); 15 of the 17 malignancies (88%) were invasive cancers. Malignancies were more common in women with a personal history of breast cancer (35% vs 10%, P = .02). Conclusion In 85 developing asymmetries visualized at digital breast tomosynthesis without a sonographic correlate, there was a 20% (95% CI: 12, 29) malignancy rate, which was higher than the rates of malignancy for a developing asymmetry detected at digital mammography. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 See also the editorial by Skaane in this issue.",
        "Objective: To analyze the prevalence of non-contiguous injury of spinal cord using MRI with a focus on cervical spinal injury patients.\r\n\r\nMethods: 60 cervical spinal injury patients were reviewed using the NIMIS (National Integrated Medical Imaging System) system. The MR imaging and imaging reports for cervical spinal injury were reviewed in a University Teaching Hospital in West Ireland (45 male and 15 female). The mean age of patients in this population group was 42. They were divided into three groups based on the mechanism of injury; hyperflexion, hyperextension and axial injury as per ASIA guidelines. The presence or absence of non-contiguous spinal injury was confirmed as to whether there was marrow contusion, herniation, or fracture at any area along the spine. During evaluation of spinal injury the cervical spine is often prioritized, however the importance of surveying the entire spine is essential. It has been emphasized that the whole cervical spine including the cervicothoracic junction (CTJ)\r\n\r\nResults: A total of 9 cases (15%) showed CTJ or upper thoracic spinal injuries defined as C7-L1 injury. 2 of 21 cases revealed obvious fractures in the CTJs or upper thoracic spines. Ligamentous injury in these regions was found in only one case, Traumatic disc herniation in four cases and spinal cord injury in five cases. Nerve impingement was observed in two cases. The incidence of non-contiguous spinal injuries was higher in the axial compression injury group (25%) than in the hyperflexion injury group (21%) or the hyperextension (20%) injury group, highlighting the importance of injury mechanism.\r\n\r\nConclusion: Cervical spinal MR showed non-contiguous CTJ or upper thoracic spinal injuries in 28% of the patients with cervical spinal injury. The mechanism of cervical spinal injury did not significantly affect the incidence of the noncontiguous CTJ or upper thoracic spinal injury. Physicians in Ireland should consider imaging other areas of the spine when a cervical spinal injury is suspected.",
        "History A 70-year-old man presented to the emergency department with fever, chills, rigors, and upper abdominal discomfort. Physical examination revealed jaundice and mild right upper quadrant tenderness. Laboratory tests revealed an increased C-reactive protein level of 133 mg/L (normal range, 0.2-0.9 mg/L), a white blood cell count of 11.69 \u00d7109/L (normal range, 4-10 \u00d7109/L), and an obstructive pattern on liver function tests, with a total bilirubin level of 3.5 mg/dL (59.9 \u00b5mol/L) (normal range, 0.4-1.9 mg/dL [6.8-32.5 \u00b5mol/L]), an alkaline phosphatase level of 716 U/L (11.9 \u00b5kat/L) (normal range, 39-99 U/L [0.65-1.65 \u00b5kat/L]), and an aspartate aminotransferase level of 88 U/L (1.47 \u00b5kat/L) (normal range, 12-42 U/L [0.20-0.70 \u00b5kat/L]). Serum amylase level was within normal limits at 84 U/L (1.40 \u00b5kat/L) (normal range, 38-149 U/L [0.63-2.48 \u00b5kat/L]). A clinical diagnosis of hepatobiliary sepsis due to ascending cholangitis was made.

        "Background Approximately 40% of pancreatic tumors smaller than 2 cm are missed at abdominal CT. Purpose To develop and to validate a deep learning (DL)-based tool able to detect pancreatic cancer at CT. Materials and Methods Retrospectively collected contrast-enhanced CT studies in patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer between January 2006 and July 2018 were compared with CT studies of individuals with a normal pancreas (control group) obtained between January 2004 and December 2019. An end-to-end tool comprising a segmentation convolutional neural network (CNN) and a classifier ensembling five CNNs was developed and validated in the internal test set and a nationwide real-world validation set. The sensitivities of the computer-aided detection (CAD) tool and radiologist interpretation were compared using the McNemar test. Results A total of 546 patients with pancreatic cancer (mean age, 65 years \u00b1 12 [SD], 297 men) and 733 control subjects were randomly divided into training, validation, and test sets. In the internal test set, the DL tool achieved 89.9% (98 of 109; 95% CI: 82.7, 94.9) sensitivity and 95.9% (141 of 147; 95% CI: 91.3, 98.5) specificity (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.96; 95% CI: 0.94, 0.99), without a significant difference (P = .11) in sensitivity compared with the original radiologist report (96.1% [98 of 102]; 95% CI: 90.3, 98.9). In a test set of 1473 real-world CT studies (669 malignant, 804 control) from institutions throughout Taiwan, the DL tool distinguished between CT malignant and control studies with 89.7% (600 of 669; 95% CI: 87.1, 91.9) sensitivity and 92.8% specificity (746 of 804; 95% CI: 90.8, 94.5) (AUC, 0.95; 95% CI: 0.94, 0.96), with 74.7% (68 of 91; 95% CI: 64.5, 83.3) sensitivity for malignancies smaller than 2 cm.

        "Background Assessment of lumbar spinal stenosis at MRI is repetitive and time consuming. Deep learning (DL) could improve \u00adproductivity and the consistency of reporting. Purpose To develop a DL model for automated detection and classification of lumbar central canal, lateral recess, and neural \u00adforaminal stenosis. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, lumbar spine MRI scans obtained from September 2015 to September 2018 were included. Studies of patients with spinal instrumentation or studies with suboptimal image quality, as well as postgadolinium studies and studies of patients with scoliosis, were excluded. Axial T2-weighted and sagittal T1-weighted images were used. Studies were split into an internal training set (80%), validation set (9%), and test set (11%). Training data were labeled by four radiologists using predefined gradings (normal, mild, moderate, and severe). A two-component DL model was developed. First, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained to detect the region of interest (ROI), with a second CNN for classification. An internal test set was labeled by a musculoskeletal radiologist with 31 years of experience (reference standard) and two subspecialist radiologists (radiologist 1: A.M., 5 years of experience; radiologist 2: J.T.P.D.H., 9 years of experience). DL model performance on an external test set was evaluated. Detection recall (in percentage), interrater agreement (Gwet \u03ba), sensitivity, and specificity were calculated. Results Overall, 446 MRI lumbar spine studies were analyzed (446 patients; mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 52 years \u00b1 19; 240 women), with 396 patients in the training (80%) and validation (9%) sets and 50 (11%) in the internal test set. For internal testing, DL model and radiologist central canal recall were greater than 99%, with reduced neural foramina recall for the DL model (84.5%) and radiologist 1 (83.9%) compared with radiologist 2 (97.1%) (P < .001). For internal testing, dichotomous classification (normal or mild vs moderate or severe) showed almost-perfect agreement for both radiologists and the DL model, with respective \u03ba values of 0.98, 0.98, and 0.96 for the central canal; 0.92, 0.95, and 0.92 for lateral recesses; and 0.94, 0.95, and 0.89 for neural foramina (P < .001). External testing with 100 MRI scans of lumbar spines showed almost perfect agreement for the DL model for dichotomous classification of all ROIs (\u03ba, 0.95\u20130.96; P < .001). Conclusion A deep learning model showed comparable agreement with subspecialist radiologists for detection and classification of central canal and lateral recess stenosis, with slightly lower agreement for neural foraminal stenosis at lumbar spine MRI. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Purpose To determine if the change in tumor apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) at diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI is predictive of pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. Materials and Methods In this prospective multicenter study, 272 consecutive women with breast cancer were enrolled at 10 institutions (from August 2012 to January 2015) and were randomized to treatment with 12 weekly doses of paclitaxel (with or without an experimental agent), followed by 12 weeks of treatment with four cycles of anthracycline. Each woman underwent breast DW MRI before treatment, at early treatment (3 weeks), at midtreatment (12 weeks), and after treatment. Percentage change in tumor ADC from that before treatment (\u0394ADC) was measured at each time point. Performance for predicting pCR was assessed by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the overall cohort and according to tumor hormone receptor (HR)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) disease subtype. Results The final analysis included 242 patients with evaluable serial imaging data, with a mean age of 48 years \u00b1 10 (standard deviation); 99 patients had HR-positive (hereafter, HR+)/HER2-negative (hereafter, HER2-) disease, 77 patients had HR-/HER2- disease, 42 patients had HR+/HER2+ disease, and 24 patients had HR-/HER2+ disease. Eighty (33%) of 242 patients experienced pCR. Overall, \u0394ADC was moderately predictive of pCR at midtreatment/12 weeks (AUC = 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.52, 0.68; P = .017) and after treatment (AUC = 0.61; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.69; P = .013). Across the four disease subtypes, midtreatment \u0394ADC was predictive only for HR+/HER2- tumors (AUC = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.89; P < .001). In a test subset, a model combining tumor subtype and midtreatment \u0394ADC improved predictive performance (AUC = 0.72; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.83) over \u0394ADC alone (AUC = 0.57; 95% CI: 0.44, 0.70; P = .032.).

        "History A 64-year-old man presented with a 6-month history of lightheadedness, intermittent balance, and coordination difficulties. Two months before admission, symptoms became more substantial and persistent, with a worsening sense of disequilibrium and unsteady gait. He reported difficulties pronouncing words and mild word-finding difficulties. His wife noted a change in his cognition and memory over the same time. His medical history included well-controlled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) secondary to a long history of smoking with associated unintentional 30-lb (13.6-kg) weight loss over the previous 3 years, for which chest CT scanning was performed, revealing no abnormality. On clinical examination, the patient was alert and oriented but had slurred speech. A positive Romberg sign was noted, finger-to-nose and hand rapid alternating movement tests revealed impairment on the right side, and his gait was ataxic. The motor examination revealed normal muscle tone, bulk, and power in the upper and lower extremities. Sensory testing results were normal. Initial MRI of the brain at admission revealed abnormal findings in the left supratentorial brain (Figs 1\u20133). Of note, this patient's presentation predated the COVID-19 pandemic. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed predominant pleocytosis (23 \u00d7 106/L; normal range, [0\u20135] \u00d7 106/L) (78% lymphocytes, 22% monocytes), elevated protein level (1.23 g/L; normal range, 0.19\u20130.64 g/L), oligoclonal bands (faint one or two), and a high immunoglobulin G index (0.130 g/L; normal reference, \u22640.059 g/L). Despite extensive initial work-up for inflammatory, infectious, autoimmune, or neoplastic causes, a definitive diagnosis was not reached. Thus, repeat MRI of the brain was performed 2 weeks after admission (Fig 4).",
        "Purpose To develop and evaluate an examination consisting of magnetic resonance (MR) fingerprinting\u2013based T1, T2, and standard apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping for multiparametric characterization of prostate disease. Materials and Methods This institutional review board\u2013approved, HIPAA-compliant retrospective study of prospectively collected data included 140 patients suspected of having prostate cancer. T1 and T2 mapping was performed with fast imaging with steady-state precession\u2013based MR fingerprinting with ADC mapping. Regions of interest were drawn by two independent readers in peripheral zone lesions and normal-appearing peripheral zone (NPZ) tissue identified on clinical images. T1, T2, and ADC were recorded for each region. Histopathologic correlation was based on systematic transrectal biopsy or cognitively targeted biopsy results, if available. Generalized estimating equations logistic regression was used to assess T1, T2, and ADC in the differentiation of (a) cancer versus NPZ, (b) cancer versus prostatitis, (c) prostatitis versus NPZ, and (d) high- or intermediate-grade tumors versus low-grade tumors. Analysis was performed for all lesions and repeated in a targeted biopsy subset. Discriminating ability was evaluated by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results In this study, 109 lesions were analyzed, including 39 with cognitively targeted sampling. T1, T2, and ADC from cancer (mean, 1628 msec \u00b1 344, 73 msec \u00b1 27, and 0.773 \u00d7 10\u22123 mm2/sec \u00b1 0.331, respectively) were significantly lower than those from NPZ (mean, 2247 msec \u00b1 450, 169 msec \u00b1 61, and 1.711 \u00d7 10\u22123 mm2/sec \u00b1 0.269) (P < .0001 for each) and together produced the best separation between these groups (AUC = 0.99). ADC and T2 together produced the highest AUC of 0.83 for separating high- or intermediate-grade tumors from low-grade cancers.

        "Purpose To create a radiogenomic map linking computed tomographic (CT) image features and gene expression profiles generated by RNA sequencing for patients with non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Materials and Methods A cohort of 113 patients with NSCLC diagnosed between April 2008 and September 2014 who had preoperative CT data and tumor tissue available was studied. For each tumor, a thoracic radiologist recorded 87 semantic image features, selected to reflect radiologic characteristics of nodule shape, margin, texture, tumor environment, and overall lung characteristics. Next, total RNA was extracted from the tissue and analyzed with RNA sequencing technology. Ten highly coexpressed gene clusters, termed metagenes, were identified, validated in publicly available gene-expression cohorts, and correlated with prognosis. Next, a radiogenomics map was built that linked semantic image features to metagenes by using the t statistic and the Spearman correlation metric with multiple testing correction. Results RNA sequencing analysis resulted in 10 metagenes that capture a variety of molecular pathways, including the epidermal growth factor (EGF) pathway. A radiogenomic map was created with 32 statistically significant correlations between semantic image features and metagenes. For example, nodule attenuation and margins are associated with the late cell-cycle genes, and a metagene that represents the EGF pathway was significantly correlated with the presence of ground-glass opacity and irregular nodules or nodules with poorly defined margins. Conclusion Radiogenomic analysis of NSCLC showed multiple associations between semantic image features and metagenes that represented canonical molecular pathways, and it can result in noninvasive identification of molecular properties of NSCLC.

        "Background The first clinical CT system to use photon-counting detector (PCD) technology has become available for patient care. Purpose To assess the technical performance of the PCD CT system with use of phantoms and representative participant examinations. Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval and written informed consent from four participants were obtained. Technical performance of a dual-source PCD CT system was measured for standard and high-spatial-resolution (HR) collimations. Noise power spectrum, modulation transfer function, section sensitivity profile, iodine CT number accuracy in virtual monoenergetic images (VMIs), and iodine concentration accuracy were measured. Four participants were enrolled (between May 2021 and August 2021) in this prospective study and scanned using similar or lower radiation doses as their respective clinical examinations performed on the same day using energy-integrating detector (EID) CT. Image quality and findings from the participants' PCD CT and EID CT examinations were compared. Results All standard technical performance measures met accreditation and regulatory requirements. Relative to filtered back-projection reconstructions, images from iterative reconstruction had lower noise magnitude but preserved noise power spectrum shape and peak frequency. Maximum in-plane spatial resolutions of 125 and 208 \u00b5m were measured for HR and standard PCD CT scans, respectively. Minimum values for section sensitivity profile full width at half maximum measurements were 0.34 mm (0.2-mm nominal section thickness) and 0.64 mm (0.4-mm nominal section thickness) for HR and standard PCD CT scans, respectively. In a 120-kV standard PCD CT scan of a 40-cm phantom, VMI iodine CT numbers had a mean percentage error of 5.7%, and iodine concentration had root mean squared error of 0.5 mg/cm",
        "Purpose To evaluate the validity and reproducibility of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging\u2013based ovarian morphologic measurements for diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in adolescents. Materials and Methods This case-control study included 110 adolescent girls (age range, 13\u201317 years) who underwent pelvic MR imaging in 2006\u20132015. The case group included girls with high (n = 40, hyperandrogenism and oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea), intermediate (n = 8, hyperandrogenism), or low (n = 7, oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea) suspicion of PCOS. Control subjects were 55 age-matched (\u00b1 2 years) girls with no clinical hyperandrogenism, oligomenorrhea, or amenorrhea. The validity (sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]) of the number of follicles per ovary (FPO) measuring 9 mm or smaller (FPO-9) and FPO measuring 5 mm or smaller (FPO-5), ovarian volume (OV), sphericity index, peripheral distribution of follicles, and absence of a dominant follicle were determined, with girls who were highly suspected of having PCOS compared with control subjects as the reference. Two radiologists independently measured these criteria in 50 girls who were suspected of having PCOS to assess reproducibility (\u03ba and intraclass correlation coefficients [ICCs]). Results All criteria except sphericity index and absence of a dominant follicle were significantly associated with the level of suspicion of PCOS (P \u2264 .05). The AUCs for FPO-9 (0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.68, 0.87), FPO-5 (0.73; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.83), and OV (0.77; 95% CI: 0.68, 0.87) were significantly greater than 0.5; that was not true for sphericity index (AUC, 0.58; 95% CI: 0.47, 0.70). Sensitivity and specificity for peripheral distribution of follicles were 33% (95% CI: 19%, 49%) and 95% (95% CI: 85%, 99%), respectively; for absence of a dominant follicle, they were 90% (95% CI: 76%, 97%) and 27% (95% CI: 16%, 41%), respectively. Reproducibility was almost perfect for OV (ICC, 0.89), substantial for absence of a dominant follicle (\u03ba, 0.74), moderate for FPO-9 (ICC, 0.54) and FPO-5 (ICC, 0.61), and fair for peripheral distribution of follicles (\u03ba, 0.37). Conclusion The most accurate MR imaging\u2013based diagnostic criteria for PCOS were OV, FPO-9, and peripheral distribution of follicles; however, reproducibility of these measures was moderate, except that for OV (ICC, 0.89). \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Background Although previous studies have focused on rural disparities in the use of screening mammography, city-level use throughout the United States has not been well evaluated even though more than 30 million women live in the 500 largest cities. Purpose To evaluate disparities in the city-level use of screening mammography and to identify factors that have an impact on screening utilization. Materials and Methods This retrospective study used data from large publicly available databases, the American Community Survey and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation 500 Cities Project, which includes screening mammography utilization data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Databases were searched from January to March 2018. The use of screening mammography was evaluated at the city level by census region and division by using the Mann-Whitney U test. Univariable Spearman rank correlation and multivariable regression analysis were performed to determine the impact of factors on screening use, including population size, health-related variables (use of Papanicolaou test, obesity), income variables (median household income, poverty status, health insurance), and race. Results Overall mean city-level screening mammography use rate was 77.7% (range, 62.8%-88.9%). The highest mean utilization occurred in coastal cities, with the highest overall utilization in the New England area (82.7%). The lowest utilization rate was in Mountain states (73.6%). City-level utilization showed a positive correlation with Papanicolaou test use (r = 0.75, P < .001), median household income (r = 0.44, P < .001), and percentage Asian population (r = 0.38, P < .001) and a negative correlation with obesity (r = -0.36, P < .001), the lack of health insurance (r = -0.44, P < .001), and poverty (r = -0.30, P < .001). Multivariable analysis showed the strongest independent predictors of utilization to be percentage of women screened with the Papanicolaou test, Asian race, private insurance, and census division (R2 = 68%). Conclusion Disparities in the utilization of preventive health care services exist at the large city level, with the highest use in New England cities and lowest in Mountain cities. Predictors of higher than average utilization include census division and percentage of inhabitants who are up to date with the Papanicolaou test, are of Asian race, and have private insurance. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019.",
        "Background The lack of functional information in thoracic CT remains a limitation of its use in the clinical management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Purpose To compare the distribution of pulmonary ventilation assessed by a CT-based full-scale airway network (FAN) flow model with hyperpolarized xenon 129 (129Xe) MRI (hereafter, 129Xe MRI) and technetium 99m\u2013diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid aerosol SPECT ventilation imaging (hereafter, V-SPECT) in participants with COPD. Materials and Methods In this prospective study performed between May and August 2017, pulmonary ventilation in participants with COPD was computed by using the FAN flow model. The modeled pulmonary ventilation was compared with functional imaging data from breath-hold time-series 129Xe MRI and V-SPECT. FAN-derived ventilation images on the coronal plane and volumes of interest were compared with functional lung images. Percentage lobar ventilation estimated by the FAN model was compared with that measured at 129Xe MRI and V-SPECT. The statistical significance of ventilation distribution between FAN and functional images was demonstrated with the Spearman correlation coefficient and \u03c72 distance. Results For this study, nine participants (seven men [mean age, 65 years \u00b1 5 {standard deviation}] and two women [mean age, 63 years \u00b1 7]) with COPD that was Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease stage II\u2013IV were enrolled. FAN-modeled ventilation profile showed strong positive correlation with images from 129Xe MRI (\u03c1 = 0.67; P < .001) and V-SPECT (\u03c1 = 0.65; P < .001). The \u03c72 distances of the ventilation histograms in the volumes of interest between the FAN and 129Xe MRI and FAN and V-SPECT were 0.16 \u00b1 0.08 and 0.28 \u00b1 0.14, respectively. The ratios of lobar ventilations in the models were linearly correlated to images from 129Xe MRI (\u03c1 = 0.67; P < .001) and V-SPECT (\u03c1 = 0.59; P < .001). Conclusion A CT-based full-scale airway network flow model provided regional pulmonary ventilation information for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and correlates with hyperpolarized xenon 129 MRI and technetium 99m\u2013diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid aerosol SPECT ventilation imaging. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "History A 19-year-old woman with no pertinent medical history was brought to the emergency department after being found unconscious on her bathroom floor by her roommate. In the preceding weeks, she had reported intractable nausea and vomiting, for which she had been taking ondansetron. No other medications had been prescribed. The day prior to presentation, she had contacted her mother and described increasing confusion. Glasgow coma scale score on arrival in the emergency department was 4. Intravenous naloxone was administered, without immediate response. Initial blood glucose level was 232 mg/dL (12.8 mmol/L) (normal range, 79-140 mg/dL [4.4- 7.7 mmol/L]), and other routine laboratory test results were normal. Urine toxicology results were negative. Cerebrospinal fluid evaluation revealed levels were within normal limits. Neurologic examination revealed dilated pupils, which showed a sluggish response to light, and left lower extremity rigidity with intermittent tremors. Initial unenhanced cranial computed tomographic (CT) findings were negative. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the brain was performed. The patient's condition deteriorated, with increasing cerebral edema over the next week, and she was declared brain dead. Her liver was transplanted into an adult recipient, who subsequently developed cerebral edema and elevated plasma ammonia levels, resulting in death in the immediate postoperative period.",
        "History A 26-year-old man presented with a 1-month history of chest pain, a palpable and painful right inguinal mass, and edema in the right lower extremity. One month earlier, he started to experience left chest pain with no cough. Pulmonary CT angiography (CTA) revealed a left lower lobe segmental pulmonary embolus. The local hospital made a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. He received anticoagulants, and his chest pain was gradually relieved. At the time of current presentation, the patient was experiencing right lower extremity swelling and pain. Physical examination revealed a 4 \u00d7 3 cm palpable right inguinal mass with no redness. His medical history and family history were negative. The results of laboratory work-up were normal, with a d-dimer level of 0.16 mg/L fibrinogen equivalent units (reference range, <0.46 mg/L) and an international normalized ratio of 2.45 (therapeutic range, 2.0\u20133.0 for a patient taking warfarin), except the prothrombin time was 28.2 seconds (reference range, 9.6\u201312.8 seconds) and the activated partial thromboplastin time was 52.2 seconds (reference range, 24.8\u201333.8 seconds). Echocardiography, chest radiography, chest CT, and contrast-enhanced (CE) CT revealed no abnormalities. The patient underwent right lower extremity vascular conventional US (Philips IU22; Philips) with an L9\u20133 probe (3\u20139 MHz, venous condition) and contrast-enhanced US (1.5\u20132.0 mL, SonoVue; Bracco) with an intravenous bolus injection at the initial evaluation.

        "Some patients with positive chest CT findings may present with negative results of real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this study, the authors present chest CT findings from five patients with COVID-19 infection who had initial negative RT-PCR results. All five patients had typical imaging findings, including ground-glass opacity (five patients) and/or mixed ground-glass opacity and mixed consolidation (two patients). After isolation for presumed COVID-19 pneumonia, all patients were eventually confirmed to have COVID-19 infection by means of repeated swab tests. A combination of repeated swab tests and CT scanning may be helpful for individuals with a high clinical suspicion of COVID-19 infection but negative findings at RT-PCR screening.",
        "Background Evaluation of interstitial lung disease (ILD) at CT is a challenging task that requires experience and is subject to substantial interreader variability. Purpose To investigate whether a proposed content-based image retrieval (CBIR) of similar chest CT images by using deep learning can aid in the diagnosis of ILD by readers with different levels of experience. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included patients with confirmed ILD after multidisciplinary discussion and available CT images identified between January 2000 and December 2015. Database was composed of four disease classes: usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, and chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Eighty patients were selected as queries from the database. The proposed CBIR retrieved the top three similar CT images with diagnosis from the database by comparing the extent and distribution of different regional disease patterns quantified by a deep learning algorithm. Eight readers with varying experience interpreted the query CT images and provided their most probable diagnosis in two reading sessions 2 weeks apart, before and after applying CBIR. Diagnostic accuracy was analyzed by using McNemar test and generalized estimating equation, and interreader agreement was analyzed by using Fleiss \u03ba. Results A total of 288 patients were included (mean age, 58 years \u00b1 11 [standard deviation]; 145 women). After applying CBIR, the overall diagnostic accuracy improved in all readers (before CBIR, 46.1% [95% CI: 37.1, 55.3]; after CBIR, 60.9% [95% CI: 51.8, 69.3]; P < .001). In terms of disease category, the diagnostic accuracy improved after applying CBIR in UIP (before vs after CBIR, 52.4% vs 72.8%, respectively; P < .001) and NSIP cases (before vs after CBIR, 42.9% vs 61.6%, respectively; P < .001). Interreader agreement improved after CBIR (before vs after CBIR Fleiss \u03ba, 0.32 vs 0.47, respectively; P = .005). Conclusion The proposed content-based image retrieval system for chest CT images with deep learning improved the diagnostic accuracy of interstitial lung disease and interreader agreement in readers with different levels of experience. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Background The workflow of breast cancer screening programs could be improved given the high workload and the high number of false-positive and false-negative assessments. Purpose To evaluate if using an artificial intelligence (AI) system could reduce workload without reducing cancer detection in breast cancer screening with digital mammography (DM) or digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). Materials and Methods Consecutive screening-paired and independently read DM and DBT images acquired from January 2015 to December 2016 were retrospectively collected from the C\u00f3rdoba Tomosynthesis Screening Trial. The original reading settings were single or double reading of DM or DBT images. An AI system computed a cancer risk score for DM and DBT examinations independently. Each original setting was compared with a simulated autonomous AI triaging strategy (the least suspicious examinations for AI are not human-read; the rest are read in the same setting as the original, and examinations not recalled by radiologists but graded as very suspicious by AI are recalled) in terms of workload, sensitivity, and recall rate. The McNemar test with Bonferroni correction was used for statistical analysis. Results A total of 15 987 DM and DBT examinations (which included 98 screening-detected and 15 interval cancers) from 15 986 women (mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 58 years \u00b1 6) were evaluated. In comparison with double reading of DBT images (568 hours needed, 92 of 113 cancers detected, 706 recalls in 15 987 examinations), AI with DBT would result in 72.5% less workload (P < .001, 156 hours needed), noninferior sensitivity (95 of 113 cancers detected, P = .38), and 16.7% lower recall rate (P < .001, 588 recalls in 15 987 examinations). Similar results were obtained for AI with DM. In comparison with the original double reading of DM images (222 hours needed, 76 of 113 cancers detected, 807 recalls in 15 987 examinations), AI with DBT would result in 29.7% less workload (P < .001), 25.0% higher sensitivity (P < .001), and 27.1% lower recall rate (P < .001). Conclusion Digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis screening strategies based on artificial intelligence systems could reduce workload up to 70%. Published under a CC BY 4.0 license.",
        "Background: Diabetes mellitus (DM), a devastating disease, is one of the major global public health burdens. In Port-Harcourt, the prevalence of type 2 DM is estimated at 7.9%. Diabetic individuals are more prone to advanced atherosclerosis, a known risk factor for stroke. DM has been reported as one of the commonest factors for stroke at the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital (UPTH), Port Harcourt. Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) is a marker of the degree of atherosclerosis with resulting carotid haemodynamic changes and these have been found useful in predicting the risk of stroke in type 2 diabetics.\r\nAims and Objectives: To sonographically evaluate the CIMT and blood flow velocities in type 2 diabetics and to compare the findings to those of non-diabetics.\r\nMaterials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional comparative study carried out between February, 2015 and June, 2016. Participants were recruited from UPTH and Braithwaite Memorial Specialist Hospital (BMSH), Port Harcourt. Seven-hundred participants, comprising equal number of type 2 diabetics and non-diabetics aged 18 years and above, had colour Doppler ultrasound scan of the carotid arteries; to measure CIMT and blood flow velocities. The results in the type 2 diabetic group were compared with those of non-diabetic group. Sonographic parameters were correlated with age, gender and BMI. CIMT was also correlated with duration of diabetes. Data was analyzed using statistical package for social sciences (SPSS), version 21 for Windows. P-values \u2264 0.05 (5% level of significance), were considered significant.\r\nResults: There were 174(49.7%) males and 176(50.3%) females among the 350 type 2 diabetic participants, while there were 158(45.1%) males and 192(54.9%) females among the 350 non-diabetic participants. Mean age for type 2 diabetic group was 59.3\u00b110.2 years, while the mean age for the non-diabetic group was 49.6\u00b112.4 years. The cumulative mean\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsonographic parameters measured, stated as type 2 diabetic group versus non-diabetic group were as follows, CIMT: 1.09\u00b10.25mm vs 0.94\u00b10.24mm, CCA PSV: 105.43\u00b120.68cm/s vs 112.16\u00b117.07cm/s, CCA EDV: 26.63\u00b111.65cm/s vs 29.65\u00b16.62cm/s, ICA PSV: 90.58\u00b120.29cm/s vs 97.39\u00b114.56cm/s, ICA EDV: 26.79\u00b17.66cm/s vs 30.85\u00b16.88cm/s and ICA/CCA PSV ratio: 1.33\u00b10.29 vs 1.33\u00b10.26.\r\nConclusion: Type 2 diabetic patients had significantly higher CIMT values than non- diabetics (p = 0.001); CIMT increased with advancing age in both groups. Carotid blood flow velocities in the common carotid and internal carotid arteries were significantly lower in type 2 diabetics compared to non-diabetics. CIMT also increased significantly with duration of DM (r=0.194, p=0.001). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of carotid plaques between type 2 diabetics and non-diabetics (p = 0.32).\r\nKey words: Doppler, Diabetes mellitus, CIMT, Carotid Blood Flow Velocities.",
        "History A 17-year-old white male adolescent was re-evaluated for a withheld cardiac condition initially detected during prenatal imaging at an outside institution. He had previously experienced intermittent episodes of shortness of breath, chest pain, and palpitations with exertion, but more recently he had been asymptomatic. He had no other comorbidities and no family history of congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, or sudden cardiac death. At physical examination, the patient had a grade II/IV rumbling systolic murmur best heard at the left upper sternal border. Otherwise, cardiovascular and other physical examination findings were normal. An electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia and nonspecific T wave changes. A graded exercise stress test was normal. Cardiac MRI was performed without and with gadolinium-based contrast material ( Figs 1 - 3 ). Multiple echocardiograms obtained since birth, cardiac MR images obtained 2 and 4 years earlier ( Fig 4 ), and nongated CT images obtained with iodinated contrast material to evaluate trauma 8 years prior ( Fig 5 ) showed findings similar to those of the current examination. Prior chest radiographs (not shown) were normal, and angiography performed when the patient was 4 years old revealed normal coronary arteries.

        "Background Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 2.0 requires multiparametric MRI of the prostate, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging sequences; however, the contribution of DCE imaging remains unclear. Purpose To assess whether DCE imaging in addition to apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and normalized T2 values improves PI-RADS version 2.0 for prediction of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, clinically reported PI-RADS lesions in consecutive men who underwent 3-T multiparametric MRI (T2-weighted, DWI, and DCE MRI) from May 2015 to September 2016 were analyzed quantitatively and compared with systematic and targeted MRI-transrectal US fusion biopsy. The normalized T2 signal (nT2), ADC measurement, mean early-phase DCE signal (mDCE), and heuristic DCE parameters were calculated. Logistic regression analysis indicated the most predictive DCE parameters for csPCa (Gleason grade group \u22652). Receiver operating characteristic parameter models were compared using the Obuchowski test. Recursive partitioning analysis determined ADC and mDCE value ranges for combined use with PI-RADS. Results Overall, 260 men (median age, 64 years [IQR, 58-69 years]) with 432 lesions (csPCa [n = 152] and no csPCa [n = 280]) were included. The mDCE parameter was predictive of csPCa when accounting for the ADC and nT2 parameter in the peripheral zone (odds ratio [OR], 1.76; 95% CI: 1.30, 2.44; P = .001) but not the transition zone (OR, 1.17; 95% CI: 0.81, 1.69; P = .41). Recursive partitioning analysis selected an ADC cutoff of 0.897 \u00d7 10-3 mm2/sec (P = .04) as a classifier for peripheral zone lesions with a PI-RADS score assessed on the ADC map (hereafter, ADC PI-RADS) of 3. The mDCE parameter did not differentiate ADC PI-RADS 3 lesions (P = .11), but classified lesions with ADC PI-RADS scores greater than 3 with low ADC values (less than 0.903 \u00d7 10-3 mm2/sec, P < .001) into groups with csPCa rates of 70% and 97% (P = .008). A lesion size cutoff of 1.5 cm and qualitative DCE parameters were not defined as classifiers according to recursive partitioning (P > .05). Conclusion Quantitative or qualitative dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI was not relevant for Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) 3 lesion risk stratification, while quantitative apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were helpful in upgrading PI-RADS 3 and PI-RADS 4 lesions. Quantitative ADC measurement may be more important for risk stratification than current methods in future versions of PI-RADS. \u00a9 RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article See also the editorial by Goh in this issue.",
        "History A 24-year-old right-handed woman presented to a neuro-ophthalmology clinic in Massachusetts in the summer with acute binocular diplopia when looking down and to the left, which started about 1 month earlier. Her medical history was notable for Raynaud syndrome, recurrent streptococcal pharyngitis, and an allergy to amoxicillin. Three days prior to developing diplopia, she presented to an outside emergency department due to fever, chills, and back pain. She received ciprofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection based on urinalysis, which demonstrated few bacteria and was negative for leukocyte esterase, nitrites, and white blood cells. She then presented again to an outside emergency department for diplopia evaluation. Initial MRI and MR angiography of the brain at that time did not demonstrate any relevant findings, and the patient was referred to our department for neuro-ophthalmic evaluation, where she was seen 4 weeks later. Neuro-ophthalmic examination revealed 20/20 visual acuity in both eyes, and a right hypertropia in left gaze, downgaze and right head tilt, with right eye excyclotorsion. There were no ocular signs of myasthenia gravis or thyroid eye disease, nor did the patient report ocular or systemic symptoms. She denied recent travel. High-spatial-resolution MRI of the brain and orbit were performed.",
        "The World Health Organization (WHO) undertook the development of a rapid guide on the use of chest imaging in the diagnosis and management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The rapid guide was developed over 2 months by using standard WHO processes, except for the use of \"rapid reviews\" and online meetings of the panel. The evidence review was supplemented by a survey of stakeholders regarding their views on the acceptability, feasibility, impact on equity, and resource use of the relevant chest imaging modalities (chest radiography, chest CT, and lung US). The guideline development group had broad expertise and country representation. The rapid guide includes three diagnosis recommendations and four management recommendations. The recommendations cover patients with confirmed or who are suspected of having COVID-19 with different levels of disease severity, throughout the care pathway from outpatient facility or hospital entry to home discharge. All recommendations are conditional and are based on low certainty evidence (",
        "History Part one of this case appeared 4 months previously and may contain larger images. A 40-year-old woman presented to the outpatient department of our hospital with a 2-year history of abdominal pain, which had worsened in the past few days. There were no other constitutional symptoms; in particular, there was no weight loss or loss of appetite. The serum amylase and serum lipase levels were always within normal limits, even during the current episode. There was no history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, drug use, or trauma. The patient was evaluated at an outside clinic 2 years ago and underwent imaging, including US and dedicated pancreatic CT, which revealed a complex multiseptated noncalcified pancreatic cystic lesion. After CT, the patient underwent endoscopic US, which showed the lesion was suspected to be an infected parasitic cyst; fine-needle aspiration and cytology were not attempted due to the risk of iatrogenic rupture. The patient was advised to undergo surgical resection but declined the procedure and was lost to follow-up for 2 years before her current visit to our facility. On clinical examination, there were no clinically important findings, aside from mild to moderate pain on deep palpation and some shifting dullness that was suggestive of ascites. The patient always remained hemodynamically stable. US-guided ascitic fluid analysis was performed, which revealed amylase levels of 869 IU/L (normal range, 4\u2013234 IU/L). Considering prior CT and endoscopic US reports, the patient was further evaluated with a pancreatic MRI protocol for lesion characterization and to explain the new-onset abdominal pain.",

        "Background Renal impairment is common in patients with coronary artery disease and, if severe, late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging for myocardial infarction (MI) evaluation cannot be performed. Purpose To develop a fully automatic framework for chronic MI delineation via deep learning on non\u2013contrast material\u2013enhanced cardiac cine MRI. Materials and Methods In this retrospective single-center study, a deep learning model was developed to extract motion features from the left ventricle and delineate MI regions on nonenhanced cardiac cine MRI collected between October 2015 and March 2017. Patients with chronic MI, as well as healthy control patients, had both nonenhanced cardiac cine (25 phases per cardiac cycle) and LGE MRI examinations. Eighty percent of MRI examinations were used for the training data set and 20% for the independent testing data set. Chronic MI regions on LGE MRI were defined as ground truth. Diagnostic performance was assessed by analysis of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). MI area and MI area percentage from nonenhanced cardiac cine and LGE MRI were compared by using the Pearson correlation, paired t test, and Bland-Altman analysis. Results Study participants included 212 patients with chronic MI (men, 171; age, 57.2 years \u00b1 12.5) and 87 healthy control patients (men, 42; age, 43.3 years \u00b1 15.5). Using the full cardiac cine MRI, the per-segment sensitivity and specificity for detecting chronic MI in the independent test set was 89.8% and 99.1%, respectively, with an AUC of 0.94. There were no differences between nonenhanced cardiac cine and LGE MRI analyses in number of MI segments (114 vs 127, respectively; P = .38), per-patient MI area (6.2 cm2 \u00b1 2.8 vs 5.5 cm2 \u00b1 2.3, respectively; P = .27; correlation coefficient, r = 0.88), and MI area percentage (21.5% \u00b1 17.3 vs 18.5% \u00b1 15.4; P = .17; correlation coefficient, r = 0.89). Conclusion The proposed deep learning framework on nonenhanced cardiac cine MRI enables the confirmation (presence), detection (position), and delineation (transmurality and size) of chronic myocardial infarction. However, future larger-scale multicenter studies are required for a full validation. Published under a CC BY 4.0 license. Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Background Protective factors against the risk of bronchiectasis are unknown. A high level of cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with a lower risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. But whether fitness relates to bronchiectasis remains, to the knowledge of the authors, unknown. Purpose To examine the association between cardiorespiratory fitness and bronchiectasis. Materials and Methods This was a secondary analysis of a prospective observational study: the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults cohort (from 1985\u20131986 [year 0] to 2015\u20132016 [year 30]). During a 30-year period, healthy participants (age at enrollment 18\u201330 years) underwent treadmill exercise testing at year 0 and year 20 visits. Cardiorespiratory fitness was determined according to the treadmill exercise duration. The 20-year difference in cardiorespiratory fitness was used as the fitness measurement. At year 25, chest CT was performed to assess bronchiectasis and was used as the primary outcome. Multivariable logistic models were performed to determine the association between cardiorespiratory fitness changes and bronchiectasis. Results Of 2177 selected participants (at year 0: mean age, 25 years \u00b1 4 [standard deviation]; 1224 women), 209 (9.6%) had bronchiectasis at year 25. After adjusting for age, race-sex group, study site, body mass index, pack-years smoked, history of tuberculosis, pneumonia, asthma and myocardial infarction, peak lung function, and cardiorespiratory fitness at baseline, preservation of cardiorespiratory fitness was associated with lower odds of bronchiectasis at CT at year 25 (per 1-minute\u2013longer treadmill duration from year 0 to year 20: odds ratio [OR], 0.88; 95% CI: 0.80, 0.98; P = .02). A consistent strong association was found when cough and phlegm were included in bronchiectasis (OR, 0.72; 95% CI: 0.59, 0.87; P < .001). Conclusion In a long-term follow-up, the preservation of cardiorespiratory fitness was associated with lower odds of bronchiectasis at CT. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "History A 65-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 1-week history of constipation, which was associated with increasing abdominal distention and not passing flatus. Four weeks prior to the current admission he had been diagnosed with metastatic primary adenocarcinoma of the appendix. One week ago, he had been hospitalized with small-bowel obstruction, for which he required laparotomy and loop ileostomy. His medical history included basal cell carcinoma, rheumatoid arthritis, and Barrett esophagus. Physical examination revealed a distended abdomen with tenderness at palpation within the right upper quadrant and lower abdomen and reduced bowel sounds at auscultation. Initial plain-film radiography of the abdomen at admission revealed dilated gas-filled small-bowel loops, suggestive of obstruction. His small-bowel obstruction was managed conservatively on this occasion. Nine days after his admission, the patient became unwell and reported a productive cough. He became tachycardic, tachypneic, and hypotensive. Relevant blood tests at this stage revealed a C-reactive protein level of 206 mg/L (normal range, 0\u201310 mg/L), a white blood cell count of 24.5 \u00d7 109/L (normal range, [4.0\u201311.0] \u00d7 109/L), a red blood cell count of 3.39 \u00d7 1012/L (normal range, [4.5\u20135.5] \u00d7 1012/L), a hemoglobin level of 93 g/L (normal range, 130\u2013170 g/L), and a hematocrit level of 0.27 (normal range, 0.4\u20130.5). CT of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast material (100 mL Omnipaque 350; GE Healthcare, Oslo, Norway) was performed (Figs 1, 2).

        "History A 10-year-old girl with global developmental delay and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder was transferred from an outside hospital because of confusion and multiple episodes of left face and arm jerking. Physical examination revealed normal muscle bulk, strength, and tone in the bilateral upper and lower extremities but insuppressible left arm and jaw twitching Lumbar puncture revealed no white or red blood cells, a normal glucose level of 55 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) (normal range, 50-80 mg/dL [2.8-4.4 mmol/L]), and an elevated protein level of 81.6 mg/dL (normal range, 15-60 mg/100 dL). A comprehensive metabolic panel revealed lactic acidosis. The patient was initially started on levetiracetam, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and topiramate for status epilepticus. Hepatic dysfunction was not present at initial admission but developed 2 months later, with an alanine aminotransferase level of 90-406 U/L (1.5-6.8 \u03bckat/L) (normal range, 8-37 U/L [0.13-0.62 \u03bckat/L]) and aspartate aminotransferase in the range of 75-187 U/L (1.2-3.1 \u03bckat/L) (normal range, 8-35 U/L [0.13-0.58 \u03bckat/L]). Electroencephalography revealed right parietal and occipital spike-and-wave discharges, with bursts of up to 20 seconds, which were indicative of subclinical status epilepticus. The family history was remarkable for a sister with head lag, developmental delay, seizure disorder, and liver failure.",
        "Background Macrotrabecular-massive (MTM) subtype of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive variant associated with angiogenesis and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which is expected to be noninvasively identified using radiomics approaches. Purpose To construct a CT radiomics model to predict the MTM subtype and to investigate the underlying immune infiltration patterns. Materials and Methods This study included five retrospective data sets and one prospective data set from three academic medical centers between January 2015 and December 2021. The preoperative liver contrast-enhanced CT studies of 365 adult patients with resected HCC were evaluated. The Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University provided the training set and internal test set, while Yueyang Central Hospital and Hunan Cancer Hospital provided the external test sets. Radiomic features were extracted and used to develop a radiomics model with machine learning in the training set, and the performance was verified in the two test sets. The outcomes cohort, including 58 adult patients with advanced HCC undergoing transarterial chemoembolization and antiangiogenic therapy, was used to evaluate the predictive value of the radiomics model for progression-free survival (PFS). Bulk RNA sequencing of tumors from 41 patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and single-cell RNA sequencing from seven prospectively enrolled participants were used to investigate the radiomics-related immune infiltration patterns. Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of the radiomics model was calculated, and Cox proportional regression was performed to identify predictors of PFS. Results Among 365 patients (mean age, 55 years \u00b1 10 [SD]; 319 men) used for radiomics modeling, 122 (33%) were confirmed to have the MTM subtype. The radiomics model included 11 radiomic features and showed good performance for predicting the MTM subtype, with AUCs of 0.84, 0.80, and 0.74 in the training set, internal test set, and external test set, respectively. A low radiomics model score relative to the median value in the outcomes cohort was independently associated with PFS (hazard ratio, 0.4; 95% CI: 0.2, 0.8; P = .01). The radiomics model was associated with dysregulated humoral immunity involving B-cell infiltration and immunoglobulin synthesis. Conclusion Accurate prediction of the macrotrabecular-massive subtype in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma was achieved using a CT radiomics model, which was also associated with defective humoral immunity.

        "Background The prognostic value of myocardial trabecular complexity in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is unknown. Purpose To explore the prognostic value of myocardial trabecular complexity using fractal analysis in participants with HCM. Materials and Methods The authors prospectively enrolled participants with HCM who underwent 3.0-T cardiovascular MRI from August 2011 to October 2017. The authors also enrolled 100 age- and sex-matched healthy participants to form a comparison group. Trabeculae were quantified with fractal analysis of cine slices to estimate the fractal dimension (FD). Participants with HCM were divided into normal and high FD groups according to the upper limit of normal reference value from the healthy group. The primary end point was defined as all-cause mortality and aborted sudden cardiac death. The secondary end point was the composite of the primary end point and readmission to the hospital owing to heart failure. Internal validation was performed using the bootstrapping method. Results A total of 378 participants with HCM (median age, 50 years; age range, 40-61 years; 207 men) and 100 healthy participants (median age, 46 years; age range, 36-59 years; 55 women) were included in this study. During the median follow-up of 33 months \u00b1 18 (standard deviation), the increased maximal apical FD (\u22651.325) had a higher risk of the primary and secondary end points than those with a normal FD (<1.325) (P = .01 and P = .04, respectively). Furthermore, Cox analysis revealed that left ventricular maximal apical FD (hazard ratio range, 1.001-1.008; all P < .05) provided significant prognostic value to predict the primary and secondary end points after adjustment for the European Society of Cardiology predictors and late gadolinium enhancement. Internal validation showed that left ventricular maximal apical FD retained a good performance in predicting the primary end points with an area under the curve of 0.70 \u00b1 0.03. Conclusion Left ventricular apical fractal dimension, which reflects myocardial trabecular complexity, was an independent predictor of the primary and secondary end points in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Background Fetal MRI-based differential diagnosis of congenital lung malformations is difficult because of the paucity of well-described imaging markers. Purpose To characterize the hyperintense bronchus sign (HBS) in in vivo fetal MRI of congenital lung malformation cases. Materials and Methods In this retrospective two-center study, fetal MRI scans obtained in fetuses with congenital lung malformations at US (January 2002 to September 2018) were reviewed for the HBS, a tubular or branching hyperintense structure within a lung lesion on T2-weighted images. The frequency of the HBS and respective gestational ages in weeks and days were analyzed. Areas under the curve (AUCs), 95% CIs, and P values of the HBS regarding airway obstruction, as found in histopathologic and postnatal CT findings as the reference standards, were calculated for different gestational ages. Results A total of 177 fetuses with congenital lung malformations (95 male fetuses) and 248 fetal MRI scans obtained at a median gestational age of 25.6 weeks (interquartile range, 8.9 weeks) were included. The HBS was found in 79% (53 of 67) of fetuses with bronchial atresia, 71% (39 of 55) with bronchopulmonary sequestration (BPS), 43% (three of seven) with hybrid lesion, 15% (six of 40) with congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation, and 13% (one of eight) with bronchogenic cyst at a median gestational age of 24.9 weeks (interquartile range, 9.7 weeks). HBS on MRI scans at any gestational age had an AUC of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.83; P = .04) for the presence of isolated or BPS-associated airway obstruction at histopathologic analysis and postnatal CT. The AUC of HBS on fetal MRI scans obtained until gestational age of 26 weeks (AUC, 0.83; 95% CI: 0.75, 0.91; P < .001) was significantly higher (P = .045) than that for fetal MRI scans obtained after gestational age 26 weeks (AUC, 0.69; 95% CI: 0.57, 0.80; P = .004). Conclusion The hyperintense bronchus sign is a frequently detectable feature at fetal MRI and is associated with airway obstruction particularly before gestational age 26 weeks. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Background SARS-CoV-2 targets angiotensin-converting enzyme 2\u2013expressing cells in the respiratory tract. There are reports of breathlessness in patients many months after infection. Purpose To determine whether hyperpolarized xenon 129 MRI (XeMRI) imaging could be used to identify the possible cause of breathlessness in patients at 3 months after hospital discharge following COVID-19 infection. Materials and Methods This prospective study was undertaken between August and December of 2020, with patients and healthy control volunteers being enrolled. All patients underwent lung function tests; ventilation and dissolved-phase XeMRI, with the mean red blood cell (RBC) to tissue or plasma (TP) ratio being calculated; and a low-dose chest CT, with scans being scored for the degree of abnormalities after COVID-19. Healthy control volunteers underwent XeMRI. The intraclass correlation coefficient was calculated for volunteer and patient scans to assess repeatability. A Wilcoxon rank sum test and Cohen effect size calculation were performed to assess differences in the RBC/TP ratio between patients and control volunteers. Results Nine patients (mean age, 57 years \u00b1 7 [standard deviation]; six male patients) and five volunteers (mean age, 29 years \u00b1 3; five female volunteers) were enrolled. The mean time from hospital discharge for patients was 169 days (range, 116\u2013254 days). There was a difference in the RBC/TP ratio between patients and control volunteers (0.3 \u00b1 0.1 vs 0.5 \u00b1 0.1, respectively; P = .001; effect size, 1.36). There was significant difference between the RBC and gas phase spectral full width at half maximum between volunteers and patients (median \u00b1 range, 567 \u00b1 1 vs 507 \u00b1 81 [P = .002] and 104 \u00b1 2 vs 122 \u00b1 17 [P = .004], respectively).

        "Purpose To compare breast cancer detection performance of radiologists reading mammographic examinations unaided versus supported by an artificial intelligence (AI) system. Materials and Methods An enriched retrospective, fully crossed, multireader, multicase, HIPAA-compliant study was performed. Screening digital mammographic examinations from 240 women (median age, 62 years; range, 39-89 years) performed between 2013 and 2017 were included. The 240 examinations (100 showing cancers, 40 leading to false-positive recalls, 100 normal) were interpreted by 14 Mammography Quality Standards Act-qualified radiologists, once with and once without AI support. The readers provided a Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System score and probability of malignancy. AI support provided radiologists with interactive decision support (clicking on a breast region yields a local cancer likelihood score), traditional lesion markers for computer-detected abnormalities, and an examination-based cancer likelihood score. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), specificity and sensitivity, and reading time were compared between conditions by using mixed-models analysis dof variance and generalized linear models for multiple repeated measurements. Results On average, the AUC was higher with AI support than with unaided reading (0.89 vs 0.87, respectively; P = .002). Sensitivity increased with AI support (86% [86 of 100] vs 83% [83 of 100]; P = .046), whereas specificity trended toward improvement (79% [111 of 140]) vs 77% [108 of 140]; P = .06). Reading time per case was similar (unaided, 146 seconds; supported by AI, 149 seconds; P = .15). The AUC with the AI system alone was similar to the average AUC of the radiologists (0.89 vs 0.87). Conclusion Radiologists improved their cancer detection at mammography when using an artificial intelligence system for support, without requiring additional reading time.

        "Background Diagnosis of chylous effusions normally requires invasive paracentesis. Purpose To assess whether MRI with multipoint Dixon fat quantification allows for noninvasive differentiation of chylous and nonchylous ascites and pleural effusions. Materials and Methods Phantom, ex vivo, and in vivo MRI examinations were performed by using a commercially available multipoint Dixon pulse sequence with a 1.5-T MRI system. Fat fraction values were measured with a region of interest\u2013based approach on reconstructed maps. For phantom evaluation, eight titrated fatty fluid solutions (nonhuman samples) with varying triglyceride content (145\u201319 000 mg/dL [1.64\u2013214.7 mmol/L]) were examined. For ex vivo evaluation, 15 chylous and five nonchylous study participant fluid samples were examined. In a prospective study performed from June 2016 to February 2018, 29 study participants with known chylous (n = 17) and nonchylous (n = 12) effusions were evaluated with MRI. All clinical samples underwent laboratory testing for triglyceride level, total protein level, white blood cells, and red blood cells. Laboratory values were correlated with fat fraction values; the optimal fat fraction threshold was determined to differentiate chylous and nonchylous fluids. Results Phantom analysis showed that fat fraction values correlated with triglyceride content (r = 0.99, P < .001). In ex vivo studies, multipoint Dixon-derived fat fraction was higher in chylous versus nonchylous fluids (mean, 2.5% \u00b1 1.2 [standard deviation] vs 0.8% \u00b1 0.2; P = .001). Fat fraction was correlated with triglyceride content (r = 0.96, P < .001). For in vivo studies, fat fraction was greater for chylous versus nonchylous fluids (mean, 6.2% \u00b1 4.3 vs 0.6% \u00b1 0.6; P < .001). In vivo fat fraction was correlated with triglyceride content (r = 0.96, P < .001). Use of a fat fraction cutoff value greater than 1.8% yielded a sensitivity of 14 of 17 (82% [95% confidence interval (CI): 57%, 97%]) and a specificity of 12 of 12 (100% [95% CI: 74%, 100%]) for differentiation of chylous and nonchylous effusions. Conclusion MRI can help identify chylous versus nonchylous ascites and pleural effusions through use of multipoint Dixon fat quantification. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To compare biparametric contrast-free radiomic machine learning (RML), mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and radiologist assessment for characterization of prostate lesions detected during prospective MRI interpretation. Materials and Methods This single-institution study included 316 men (mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 64.0 years \u00b1 7.8) with an indication for MRI-transrectal US fusion biopsy between May 2015 and September 2016 (training cohort, 183 patients; test cohort, 133 patients). Lesions identified by prospective clinical readings were manually segmented for mean ADC and radiomics analysis. Global and zone-specific random forest RML and mean ADC models for classification of clinically significant prostate cancer (Gleason grade group \u2265 2) were developed on the training set and the fixed models tested on an independent test set. Clinical readings, mean ADC, and radiomics were compared by using the McNemar test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results In the test set, radiologist interpretation had a per-lesion sensitivity of 88% (53 of 60) and specificity of 50% (79 of 159). Quantitative measurement of the mean ADC (cut-off 732 mm2/sec) significantly reduced false-positive (FP) lesions from 80 to 60 (specificity 62% [99 of 159]) and false-negative (FN) lesions from seven to six (sensitivity 90% [54 of 60]) (P = .048). Radiologist interpretation had a per-patient sensitivity of 89% (40 of 45) and specificity of 43% (38 of 88). Quantitative measurement of the mean ADC reduced the number of patients with FP lesions from 50 to 43 (specificity 51% [45 of 88]) and the number of patients with FN lesions from five to three (sensitivity 93% [42 of 45]) (P = .496). Comparison of the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the mean ADC (AUCglobal = 0.84; AUCzone-specific \u2264 0.87) vs the RML (AUCglobal = 0.88, P = .176; AUCzone-specific \u2264 0.89, P \u2265 .493) showed no significantly different performance. Conclusion Quantitative measurement of the mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) improved differentiation of benign versus malignant prostate lesions, compared with clinical assessment. Radiomic machine learning had comparable but not better performance than mean ADC assessment. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To compare two technical approaches for determination of coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography\u2013derived fractional flow reserve (FFR)\u2014FFR derived from coronary CT angiography based on computational fluid dynamics (hereafter, FFRCFD) and FFR derived from coronary CT angiography based on machine learning algorithm (hereafter, FFRML)\u2014against coronary CT angiography and quantitative coronary angiography (QCA). Materials and Methods A total of 85 patients (mean age, 62 years \u00b1 11 [standard deviation]; 62% men) who had undergone coronary CT angiography followed by invasive FFR were included in this single-center retrospective study. FFR values were derived on-site from coronary CT angiography data sets by using both FFRCFD and FFRML. The performance of both techniques for detecting lesion-specific ischemia was compared against visual stenosis grading at coronary CT angiography, QCA, and invasive FFR as the reference standard. Results On a per-lesion and per-patient level, FFRML showed a sensitivity of 79% and 90% and a specificity of 94% and 95%, respectively, for detecting lesion-specific ischemia. Meanwhile, FFRCFD resulted in a sensitivity of 79% and 89% and a specificity of 93% and 93%, respectively, on a per-lesion and per-patient basis (P = .86 and P = .92). On a per-lesion level, the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.89 for FFRML and 0.89 for FFRCFD showed significantly higher discriminatory power for detecting lesion-specific ischemia compared with that of coronary CT angiography (AUC, 0.61) and QCA (AUC, 0.69) (all P < .0001). Also, on a per-patient level, FFRML (AUC, 0.91) and FFRCFD (AUC, 0.91) performed significantly better than did coronary CT angiography (AUC, 0.65) and QCA (AUC, 0.68) (all P < .0001). Processing time for FFRML was significantly shorter compared with that of FFRCFD (40.5 minutes \u00b1 6.3 vs 43.4 minutes \u00b1 7.1; P = .042). Conclusion The FFRML algorithm performs equally in detecting lesion-specific ischemia when compared with the FFRCFD approach. Both methods outperform accuracy of coronary CT angiography and QCA in the detection of flow-limiting stenosis. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018",
        "HistoryA 34-year-old man presented to the emergency department of our hospital for progressive shortness of breath and worsening productive cough of 2 weeks duration. He reported a 10-kg weight loss over 4 months but denied experiencing fever, chills, night sweats, or gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, or neurologic symptoms. His medical history was unremarkable. Although he was a native of Morocco, he had lived in Europe for many years and worked as a truck driver. The patient had a smoking history but had quit smoking 5 years prior to presentation. He denied alcohol abuse or recreational drug use. He did not have any allergies. Besides bilateral clubbing, the physical examination findings were normal. At the time of admission, he had an oxygen (O2) saturation of 87% at ambient air, which increased to 100% with 1 L of O2 administered via a nasal cannula. The blood sample revealed a slight increase in his hemoglobin concentration (18.7 g/dL; normal range, 13.6-17.2 g/dL) and hematocrit level (50.8%; normal range, 39%-49%). His inflammatory parameters were normal, as were his hepatic and renal function. The arterial blood gas test showed partially compensated pulmonary alkalosis (pH, 7.43; normal range, 7.35-7.42; PCO2, 26 mmHg; normal range, 38-42 mmHg; PO2, 89 mmHg; normal range, 75-100 mmHg; bicarbonate level, 17 mEq/L [17 mmol/L]; normal range 22-26 mEq/L [22-26 mmol/L]). The results of the pulmonary function tests were expressed as the percentage of predicted values and were 92% for forced vital capacity, 93% for forced expiratory volume in 1 second, 116% for total lung capacity, and 60% for diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide. Anteroposterior chest radiography and enhanced chest CT were also performed at admission.",
        "Purpose To evaluate the diagnostic performance and interrater reliability of the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) version 2014 in differentiating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from non-HCC malignancy in a population of patients at risk for HCC. Materials and Methods This retrospective HIPAA-compliant institutional review board-approved study was exempt from informed consent. A total of 178 pathology-proven malignant liver masses were identified in 178 patients at risk for HCC but without established extrahepatic malignancy from August 2012 through August 2015. Two readers blinded to pathology findings and clinical follow-up data independently evaluated a liver protocol magnetic resonance or computed tomography study for each lesion and assigned LI-RADS categories, scoring all major and most ancillary features. Statistical analyses included the independent samples t test, x2 test, Fisher exact test, and Cohen k. Results This study included 136 HCCs and 42 non-HCC malignancies. Specificity and positive predictive value of an HCC imaging diagnosis (LR-5 or LR-5V) were 69.0% and 90.5%, respectively, for reader 1 (R1) and 88.3% and 95.5%, respectively, for reader 2 (R2). Tumor in vein was a common finding in patients with non-HCC malignancies (R1, 10 of 42 [23.8%]; R2, five of 42 [11.9%]). Exclusion of the LR-5V pathway improved specificity and positive predictive value for HCC to 83.3% and 92.9%, respectively, for R1 (six fewer false-positive findings) and 92.3% and 96.4%, respectively, for R2 (one fewer false-positive finding). Among masses with arterial phase hyperenhancement, the rim pattern was more common among non-HCC malignancies than among HCCs for both readers (R1: 24 of 36 [66.7%] vs 13 of 124, [10.5%], P < .001; R2: 27 of 35 [77.1%] vs 21 of 123 [17.1%], P < .001) (k = 0.76). Exclusion of rim arterial phase hyperenhancement as a means of satisfying LR-5 criteria also improved specificity and positive predictive value for HCC (R1, two fewer false-positive findings). Conclusion Modification of the algorithmic role of tumor in vein and rim arterial phase hyperenhancement improves the diagnostic performance of LI-RADS version 2014 in differentiating HCC from non-HCC malignancy. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To test the hypothesis that hepatic triglyceride content is associated with subclinical vascular impairment and is not confounded by various cardiometabolic risk factors. Materials and Methods This study was approved by the institutional review board, and all participants gave written informed consent. In this cross-sectional analysis of baseline measurements of the Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity study, a population-based cohort study, 1899 participants (52% men; mean age, 55 years \u00b1 6 [standard deviation]) underwent magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy and MR imaging to assess hepatic triglyceride content, aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV), and visceral fat. Carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) was acquired and measured by trained research nurses according to standard procedures. Multivariate regression analyses were used to study associations of hepatic triglyceride content with total and regional aortic PWV and carotid IMT while adjusting for several possible confounding factors, including the metabolic syndrome. Results Total aortic PWV (mean difference, 0.5 m/sec; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.3, 0.7) and carotid IMT (mean difference, 37 \u03bcm; 95% CI: 25, 49) were higher in participants with hepatic steatosis. After adjusting for various covariates, a 10-fold increase in hepatic triglyceride content was associated with an increased mean aortic PWV of 0.19 m/sec (95% CI: 0.03, 0.36) in total and an increased mean aortic PWV of 0.42 m/sec (95% CI: 0.03, 0.81) in the abdominal segment. A 10-fold increase in hepatic triglyceride content was also associated with an increased mean carotid IMT of 15 \u03bcm (95% CI: 0, 29) but not after additional adjustments for visceral and total body fat. Conclusion In this relatively large population-based cohort study, hepatic triglyceride content was associated with aortic pulse wave velocity and carotid IMT. These associations were only partly explained by the metabolic syndrome and visceral adiposity, suggesting a possible specific contribution of hepatic steatosis to subclinical vascular impairment. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Background The associations of density measures from the publicly available Laboratory for Individualized Breast Radiodensity Assessment (LIBRA) software with breast cancer have primarily focused on estimates from the contralateral breast at the time of diagnosis. Purpose To evaluate LIBRA measures on mammograms obtained before breast cancer diagnosis and compare their performance to established density measures. Materials and Methods For this retrospective case-control study, full-field digital mammograms in for-processing (raw) and for-presentation (processed) formats were obtained (March 2008 to December 2011) in women who developed breast cancer an average of 2 years later and in age-matched control patients. LIBRA measures included absolute dense area and area percent density (PD) from both image formats. For comparison, dense area and PD were assessed by using the research software (Cumulus), and volumetric PD (VPD) and absolute dense volume were estimated with a commercially available software (Volpara). Density measures were compared by using Spearman correlation coefficients (r), and conditional logistic regression (odds ratios [ORs] and 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) was performed to examine the associations of density measures with breast cancer by adjusting for age and body mass index. Results Evaluated were 437 women diagnosed with breast cancer (median age, 62 years \u00b1 17 [standard deviation]) and 1225 matched control patients (median age, 61 years \u00b1 16). LIBRA PD showed strong correlations with Cumulus PD (r = 0.77-0.84) and Volpara VPD (r = 0.85-0.90) (P < .001 for both). For LIBRA, the strongest breast cancer association was observed for PD from processed images (OR, 1.3; 95% CI: 1.1, 1.5), although the PD association from raw images was not significantly different (OR, 1.2; 95% CI: 1.1, 1.4; P = .25). Slightly stronger breast cancer associations were seen for Cumulus PD (OR, 1.5; 95% CI: 1.3, 1.8; processed images; P = .01) and Volpara VPD (OR, 1.4; 95% CI: 1.2, 1.7; raw images; P = .004) compared with LIBRA measures. Conclusion Automated density measures provided by the Laboratory for Individualized Breast Radiodensity Assessment from raw and processed mammograms correlated with established area and volumetric density measures and showed comparable breast cancer associations. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Background Macrophage burden is a major factor in the risk of atherosclerotic plaque rupture, and its evaluation remains challenging with molecular noninvasive imaging approaches. Photon-counting CT (PCCT) with k-edge imaging aims to allow for the specific detection of macrophages using gold nanoparticles. Purpose To perform k-edge imaging in combination with gold nanoparticles to detect and quantify the macrophage burden within the atherosclerotic aortas of rabbits. Materials and Methods Atherosclerotic and control New Zealand white rabbits were imaged before and at several time points up to 2 days after intravenous injection of gold nanoparticles (3.5 mL/kg, 65 mg gold per milliliter). Aortic CT angiography was performed at the end of the follow-up using an intravenous injection of an iodinated contrast material. Gold k-edge and conventional CT images were reconstructed for qualitative and quantitative assessment of the macrophage burden. PCCT imaging results were compared with findings at histologic examination, quantitative histomorphometry, transmission electron microscopy, and quantitative inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. Pearson correlations between the macrophage area measured in immunostained sections and the concentration of gold and attenuation measured in the corresponding PCCT sections were calculated. Results Seven rabbits with atherosclerosis and four control rabbits without atherosclerosis were analyzed. In atherosclerotic rabbits, calcifications were observed along the aortic wall before injection. At 2 days after injection of gold nanoparticles, only gold k-edge images allowed for the distinction of plaque enhancement within calcifications and for lumen enhancement during angiography. A good correlation was observed between the gold concentration measured within the wall and the macrophage area in 35 plaques (five per rabbit) (r = 0.82; 95% CI: 0.67, 0.91; P < .001), which was higher than that observed on conventional CT images (r = 0.41; 95% CI: 0.09, 0.65; P = .01). Transmission electron microscopy and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry analyses confirmed the gold k-edge imaging findings. Conclusion Photon-counting CT with gold nanoparticles allowed for the noninvasive evaluation of both molecular and anatomic information in vivo in rabbits with atherosclerotic plaques.

        "Background Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a target of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), demonstrates its highest surface expression in the lung, small bowel, and vasculature, suggesting abdominal viscera may be susceptible to injury. Purpose To report abdominal imaging findings in patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Materials and Methods In this retrospective cross-sectional study, patients consecutively admitted to a single quaternary care center from March 27 to April 10, 2020, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were included. Abdominal imaging studies performed in these patients were reviewed, and salient findings were recorded. Medical records were reviewed for clinical data. Univariable analysis and logistic regression were performed. Results A total of 412 patients (average age, 57 years; range, 18 to >90 years; 241 men, 171 women) were evaluated. A total of 224 abdominal imaging studies were performed (radiography, n = 137; US, n = 44; CT, n = 42; MRI, n = 1) in 134 patients (33%). Abdominal imaging was associated with age (odds ratio [OR], 1.03 per year of increase; P = .001) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission (OR, 17.3; P < .001). Bowel-wall abnormalities were seen on 31% of CT images (13 of 42) and were associated with ICU admission (OR, 15.5; P = .01). Bowel findings included pneumatosis or portal venous gas, seen on 20% of CT images obtained in patients in the ICU (four of 20). Surgical correlation (n = 4) revealed unusual yellow discoloration of the bowel (n = 3) and bowel infarction (n = 2). Pathologic findings revealed ischemic enteritis with patchy necrosis and fibrin thrombi in arterioles (n = 2). Right upper quadrant US examinations were mostly performed because of liver laboratory findings (87%, 32 of 37), and 54% (20 of 37) revealed a dilated sludge-filled gallbladder, suggestive of bile stasis. Patients with a cholecystostomy tube placed (n = 4) had negative bacterial cultures. Conclusion Bowel abnormalities and gallbladder bile stasis were common findings on abdominal images of patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Patients who underwent laparotomy often had ischemia, possibly due to small-vessel thrombosis. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020",
        "Background Radiomics extracts features from medical images more precisely and more accurately than visual assessment. However, radiomics features are affected by CT scanner parameters such as reconstruction kernel or section thickness, thus obscuring underlying biologically important texture features. Purpose To investigate whether a compensation method could correct for the variations of radiomic feature values caused by using different CT protocols. Materials and Methods Phantom data involving 10 texture patterns and 74 patients in cohorts 1 (19 men; 42 patients; mean age, 60.4 years; September-October 2013) and 2 (16 men; 32 patients; mean age, 62.1 years; January-September 2007) scanned by using different CT protocols were retrospectively included. For any radiomic feature, the compensation approach identified a protocol-specific transformation to express all data in a common space that were devoid of protocol effects. The differences in statistical distributions between protocols were assessed by using Friedman tests before and after compensation. Principal component analyses were performed on the phantom data to evaluate the ability to distinguish between texture patterns after compensation. Results In the phantom data, the statistical distributions of features were different between protocols for all radiomic features and texture patterns (P < .05). After compensation, the protocol effect was no longer detectable (P > .05). Principal component analysis demonstrated that each texture pattern was no longer displayed as different clusters corresponding to different imaging protocols, unlike what was observed before compensation. The correction for scanner effect was confirmed in patient data with 100% (10 of 10 features for cohort 1) and 98% (87 of 89 features for cohort 2) of P values less than .05 before compensation, compared with 30% (three of 10) and 15% (13 of 89) after compensation. Conclusion Image compensation successfully realigned feature distributions computed from different CT imaging protocols and should facilitate multicenter radiomic studies. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Purpose To compare screening mammography recall rate, cancer detection rate (CDR), and positive predictive values (PPVs) for digital mammography before and after radiologist experience with digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). Materials and Methods This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board and compliant with HIPAA. The authors reviewed screening mammography audit data obtained from 2009 to 2014, during which 108 276 digital mammographic examinations were performed (50 062 before and 58 214 after experience with DBT). Recall rate, CDR, PPV of positive screening result (PPV1), PPV of biopsy recommendation (PPV2), and PPV of biopsies performed (PPV3) of digital mammography for six radiologists were compared before (2009-2011) and after (2012-2014) experience with DBT. Radiologists worked in both a community setting, in which only digital mammography was available, and in two tertiary breast imaging centers, where they interpreted DBT images starting in 2012. Data were examined by using generalized linear mixed modeling wherein observations were nested for each radiologist over time. P < .05 was considered indicative of a statistically significant difference; 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results The average recall rate was 6.8% (range, 3.6%-9.7%) before experience with DBT and 7.9% (range, 5.5%-9.5%) after (P = .0316). Before experience with DBT, the recall rate increased only 0.01% for each year from 2009 to 2011 (P = .9727). After experience with DBT, the recall rate increased 0.65% for each year from 2012 to 2014 (P < .0127). CDR increased from 2.5 per 1000 examinations (95% CI: 2.2, 2.9) to 3.5 per 1000 examinations (95% CI: 3.0, 4.0; P = .0203). PPV2 and PPV3 increased significantly after experience with DBT, from 26.9% (95% CI: 19.9%, 35.3%) to 36.1% (95% CI: 31.7%, 40.7%; P = .0212) for PPV2 and from 31.2% (95% CI: 24.0%, 39.3%) to 40.0% (95% CI: 35.5%, 44.6%; P = .0290) for PPV3. Conclusion Recall rate, CDR, PPV2, and PPV3 of digital mammography increased after radiologist experience with DBT. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017.",
        "Purpose To determine whether gadolinium deposits in neural tissues of patients with intracranial abnormalities following intravenous gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) exposure might be related to blood-brain barrier integrity by studying adult patients with normal brain pathologic characteristics. Materials and Methods After obtaining antemortem consent and institutional review board approval, the authors compared postmortem neuronal tissue samples from five patients who had undergone four to 18 gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) examinations between 2005 and 2014 (contrast group) with samples from 10 gadolinium-naive patients who had undergone at least one MR examination during their lifetime (control group). All patients in the contrast group had received gadodiamide. Neuronal tissues from the dentate nuclei, pons, globus pallidus, and thalamus were harvested and analyzed with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, and light microscopy to quantify, localize, and assess the effects of gadolinium deposition. Results Tissues from the four neuroanatomic regions of gadodiamide-exposed patients contained 0.1\u201319.4 \u03bcg of gadolinium per gram of tissue in a statistically significant dose-dependent relationship (globus pallidus: \u03c1 = 0.90, P = .04). In contradistinction, patients in the control group had undetectable levels of gadolinium with ICP-MS. All patients had normal brain pathologic characteristics at autopsy. Three patients in the contrast group had borderline renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate <45 mL/min/1.73 m2) and hepatobiliary dysfunction at MR examination. Gadolinium deposition in the contrast group was localized to the capillary endothelium and neuronal interstitium and, in two cases, within the nucleus of the cell. Conclusion Gadolinium deposition in neural tissues after GBCA administration occurs in the absence of intracranial abnormalities that might affect the permeability of the blood-brain barrier. These findings challenge current understanding of the biodistribution of these contrast agents and their safety. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017",
        "History A 46-year-old woman with known mixed connective tissue disease with clinical features of scleroderma and polymyositis and who was not on specific medications was referred to our institution to assess for interstitial lung disease due to her predisposing condition. She was a nonsmoker, had no respiratory symptoms, and enjoyed good exercise tolerance. She did not have any cutaneous lesions or renal disease. There was no family history of pulmonary or systemic disease. Her routine blood test results revealed a white blood cell count of 4.6 \u00d7 109/L (normal range, [4.4-10.1] \u00d7 109/L), a hemoglobin level of 7.76 mmol/L (normal range, 7.26-9.18 mmol/L), a platelet count of 189 \u00d7 109/L (normal range, [170-380] \u00d7 109/L), a bilirubin level of 8 mmol/L (normal range, <19 mmol/L), and a creatinine level of 63 mmol/L (normal range, 45-82 mmol/L), all within normal limits. Lung function tests at presentation yielded normal results, with a diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide of 95% and a forced vital capacity of 2.29 (98% predicted value). However, this patient had an elevated serum globulin level of 47 g/L (normal range, 26-32 g/L) and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 36 mm/h (normal range, 0-20 mm/h), while C-reactive protein level was normal at less than 0.35 mg/dL. She was seropositive for antinuclear (titer >1/720), anti-Ro, anti-La, and anti-extractable nuclear antigen antibodies. Chest radiography and CT were performed at presentation and 14-year follow-up. PET/CT was performed at 7- and 13-year follow-up. Throughout this 14-year follow-up period, she remained completely free of respiratory symptoms and continued to go for a brisk walk every day. At 14-year follow-up, there was no substantial change in serum laboratory values, but a lung function test revealed her diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide had decreased to 52%, while her forced vital capacity remained good at 95%; these findings were suggestive of interval development of restrictive lung function.",
        "Computed tomography and magnetic resonance enterography have become routine small bowel imaging tests to evaluate patients with established or suspected Crohn's disease, but the interpretation and use of these imaging modalities can vary widely. A shared understanding of imaging findings, nomenclature, and utilization will improve the utility of these imaging techniques to guide treatment options, as well as assess for treatment response and complications. Representatives from the Society of Abdominal Radiology Crohn's Disease-Focused Panel, the Society of Pediatric Radiology, the American Gastroenterological Association, and other experts, systematically evaluated evidence for imaging findings associated with small bowel Crohn's disease enteric inflammation and established recommendations for the evaluation, interpretation, and use of computed tomography and magnetic resonance enterography in small bowel Crohn's disease. This work makes recommendations for imaging findings that indicate small bowel Crohn's disease, how inflammatory small bowel Crohn's disease and its complications should be described, elucidates potential extra-enteric findings that may be seen at imaging, and recommends that cross-sectional enterography should be performed at diagnosis of Crohn's disease and considered for small bowel Crohn's disease monitoring paradigms. A useful morphologic construct describing how imaging findings evolve with disease progression and response is described, and standard impressions for radiologic reports that convey meaningful information to gastroenterologists and surgeons are presented. \u00a92018, RSNA, AGA Institute, and Society of Abdominal Radiology This article is being published jointly in Radiology and Gastroenterology.",
        "A 29-year-old woman was referred for US of bilateral breasts during evaluation for noncyclical mastalgia predominantly in the left breast of 8 months duration. She had been taking selective serotonin receptor inhibitors for the past 6 months for a clinical diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder. A detailed medical history revealed breast cancer in the patient's mother and grandmother. There was no history of weight loss or appetite loss, nor was there a history of any altered bowel or bladder habits. The patient was overweight, with a body mass index of 26.8 kg/m2, and appeared anxious during the general physical examination, with an increased pulse (102 beats per minute) and normal blood pressure (118/82 mm Hg). Local examination revealed multiple small mobile painful lesions that were palpable in all quadrants of the bilateral breasts, anterior abdominal wall, and forearm. On further questioning, the patient reported similar painful lesions were present in her mother and one brother. Laboratory investigations showed a normal hemoglobin level (12.4 g/dL; normal range, 12-15 g/dL), a total leukocyte count of 9000 cells per microliter (9 cells \u00d7 109/L) (normal range, 4500-11 000 cells per microliter [4.5-11 cells \u00d7 109/L]), a normal differential leukocyte count (74% neutrophils [normal range, 40%-80%], 24% lymphocytes [normal range, 20%-40%], and 2% eosinophils [normal range, 1%-4%]), and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 5 mm per hour (normal range, 0-29 mm per hour). High-frequency US of bilateral breasts (Figs 1, 2) was performed in conjunction with Color Doppler US (Fig 3) and shear-wave elastography of representative lesions in the breasts (Fig 4).

        "Background Abdominal and thoracic CT provide a valuable opportunity for osteoporosis screening regardless of the clinical indication for imaging. Purpose To establish reference normative ranges for first lumbar vertebra (L1) trabecular attenuation values across all adult ages to measure bone mineral density (BMD) at routine CT. Materials and Methods Reference data were constructed from 20 374 abdominal and/or thoracic CT examinations performed at 120 kV. Data were derived from adults (mean age, 60 years \u00b1 12 [standard deviation]; 56.1% [11 428 of 20 374] women). CT examinations were performed with (n = 4263) or without (n = 16 111) intravenous contrast agent administration for a variety of unrelated clinical indications between 2000 and 2018. L1 Hounsfield unit measurement was obtained either with a customized automated tool (n = 11 270) or manually by individual readers (n = 9104). The effects of patient age, sex, contrast agent, and manual region-of-interest versus fully automated L1 Hounsfield unit measurement were assessed using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results Mean L1 attenuation decreased linearly with age at a rate of 2.5 HU per year, averaging 226 HU \u00b1 44 for patients younger than 30 years and 89 HU \u00b1 38 for patients 90 years or older. Women had a higher mean L1 attenuation compared with men (P < .008) until menopause, after which both groups had similar values. Administration of intravenous contrast agent resulted in negligible differences in mean L1 attenuation values except in patients younger than 40 years. The fully automated method resulted in measurements that were average 21 HU higher compared with manual measurement (P < .004); at intrapatient subanalysis, this difference was related to the level of transverse measurement used (midvertebra vs off-midline level). Conclusion Normative ranges of L1 vertebra trabecular attenuation were established across all adult ages, and these can serve as a quick reference at routine CT to identify adults with low bone mineral density who are at risk for osteoporosis. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Background: Accurate clinical staging is crucial to managing gastrointestinal cancer, but fluorine 18 ( 18 F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT has limitations.Targeting fibroblast-activation protein is a newer diagnostic approach for the visualization of tumor stroma, and gallium 68 ( 68 Ga)-labeled fibroblast-activation protein inhibitors (FAPIs), hereafter 68 Ga-FAPIs, present a promising alternative to 18 F-FDG.Purpose: To compare the diagnostic efficacy of 68 Ga-FAPI PET/CT in primary and metastatic lesions of gastrointestinal malignancies with that of 18 F-FDG PET/CT. Materials and Methods:Images from patients with gastric, duodenal, and colorectal cancers who underwent contemporaneous 18 F-FDG and 68 Ga-FAPI PET/CT between October 2019 through June 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. 18F-FDG and 68 Ga-FAPI uptakes were compared by using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.The McNemar test was used to compare the diagnostic performance between the two techniques.Results: Thirty-five patients (median age, 64 years [interquartile range, 53-68 years]; 18 men) were evaluated.In treatment-naive patients (n = 19), 68 Ga-FAPI PET/CT led to upstaging of the clinical TNM stage in four (21%) patients compared with 18 F-FDG PET/CT.Tracer uptake was higher with 68 Ga-FAPI PET/CT than with 18 F-FDG PET/CT in primary lesions (gastric cancer: 12.7 vs 3.7, respectively, P = .003;colorectal cancer: 15.9 vs 7.9, P = .03),involved lymph nodes (6.7 vs 2.4, P , .001), and bone and visceral metastases (liver metastases: 9.7 vs 5.2, P , .001;peritoneal metastases: 8.4 vs 3.6, P , .001;bone metastases: 4.3 vs 2.2, P , .001;lung metastases: 4.4 vs 1.9, P = .01).In addition, the sensitivity of 68 Ga-FAPI PET/CT was higher than that of 18 F-FDG PET/CT in the detection of primary tumors (100% [19 of 19] vs 53% [10 of 19], respectively; P = .004),lymph nodes (79% [22 of 28] vs 54% [15 of 28], P , .001), and bone and visceral metastases (89% [31 of 35] vs 57% [20 of 35], P , .001). Conclusion:Gallium 68 fibroblast-activation protein inhibitor PET/CT was superior to fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT in the detection of primary and metastatic lesions in gastric, duodenal, and colorectal cancers, with higher tracer uptake in most primary and metastatic lesions.",
        "Five cases of axillary lymphadenopathy are presented, which occurred after COVID-19 vaccination and mimicked metastasis in a vulnerable oncologic patient group. Initial radiologic diagnosis raised concerns for metastasis. However, further investigation revealed that patients received COVID-19 vaccinations in the ipsilateral arm prior to imaging. In two cases, lymph node biopsy results confirmed vaccination-related reactive lymphadenopathy. Ipsilateral axillary swelling or lymphadenopathy was reported based on symptoms and physical examination in COVID-19 vaccine trials. Knowledge of the potential for COVID-19 vaccine-related ipsilateral adenopathy is necessary to avoid unnecessary biopsy and change in therapy. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021.",
        "Background CT may play a central role in the diagnosis and management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Purpose To perform a longitudinal study to analyze the serial CT findings over time in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Materials and Methods During January 16 to February 17, 2020, 90 patients (33 men, 57 women; mean age, 45 years) with COVID-19 pneumonia were prospectively enrolled and followed up until being discharged, death, or the end of the study. A total of 366 CT scans were acquired and reviewed by two groups of radiologists for the patterns and distribution of lung abnormalities, total CT scores, and number of zones involved. Those features were analyzed for temporal change. Results CT scores and number of zones involved progressed rapidly, peaked during illness days 6-11 (median CT score, 5; median number of zones involved, five), and were followed by persistence of high levels. The predominant pattern of abnormalities after symptom onset was ground-glass opacity (35 of 78 scans [45%] to 49 of 79 scans [62%] in different periods). The percentage of mixed pattern peaked on illness days 12-17 (30 of 78 scans [38%]) and became the second most predominant pattern thereafter. Pure ground-glass opacity was the most prevalent subtype of ground-glass opacity after symptom onset (20 of 50 scans [40%] to 20 of 28 scans [71%]). The percentage of ground-glass opacity with irregular linear opacity peaked on illness days 6-11 (14 of 50 scans [28%]) and became the second most prevalent subtype thereafter. The distribution of lesions was predominantly bilateral and subpleural. Sixty-six of the 70 patients discharged (94%) had residual disease on final CT scans (median CT score, 4; median number of zones involved, four), with ground-glass opacity (42 of 70 patients [60%]) and pure ground-glass opacity (31 of 42 patients [74%]) the most common pattern and subtype. Conclusion The extent of lung abnormalities at CT peaked during illness days 6-11. The temporal changes of the diverse CT manifestations followed a specific pattern, which might indicate the progression and recovery of the illness. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",

Materials and Methods One hundred six US data sets in all subjects enrolled by three centers from a multicenter trial that included 54 malignant, 51 benign, and one indeterminate FLL were retrospectively analyzed. The 105 benign or malignant lesions were confirmed at histologic examination, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and/or 6 or more months of clinical follow-up. Data sets included 3-minute cine clips that were automatically corrected for in-plane motion and automatically filtered out frames acquired off plane. B-mode and contrast-specific features were automatically extracted on a pixel-by-pixel basis and analyzed by using an artificial neural network (ANN) and a support vector machine (SVM). Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) for CAD were compared with those for one experienced and one inexperienced blinded reader. A third observer graded cine quality to assess its effects on CAD performance. Results CAD, the inexperienced observer, and the experienced observer were able to analyze 95, 100, and 102 cine clips, respectively. The AUCs for the SVM, ANN, and experienced and inexperienced observers were 0.883 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.793, 0.940), 0.829 (95% CI: 0.724, 0.901), 0.843 (95% CI: 0.756, 0.903), and 0.702 (95% CI: 0.586, 0.782), respectively; only the difference between SVM and the inexperienced observer was statistically significant. Accuracy improved from 71.3% (67 of 94; 95% CI: 60.6%, 79.8%) to 87.7% (57 of 65; 95% CI: 78.5%, 93.8%) and from 80.9% (76 of 94; 95% CI: 72.3%, 88.3%) to 90.3% (65 of 72; 95% CI: 80.6%, 95.8%) when CAD was in agreement with the inexperienced reader and when it was in agreement with the experienced reader, respectively. B-mode heterogeneity and contrast material washout were the most discriminating features selected by CAD for all iterations. CAD selected time-based time-intensity curve (TIC) features 99.0% (207 of 209) of the time to classify FLLs, versus 1.0% (two of 209) of the time for intensity-based features. None of the 15 video-quality criteria had a statistically significant effect on CAD accuracy-all P values were greater than the Holm-Sidak \u03b1-level correction for multiple comparisons. Conclusion CAD systems classified benign and malignant FLLs with an accuracy similar to that of an expert reader. CAD improved the accuracy of both readers. Time-based features of TIC were more discriminating than intensity-based features. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To evaluate the efficacy of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) for detecting tuberculosis (TB) on chest radiographs. Materials and Methods Four deidentified HIPAA-compliant datasets were used in this study that were exempted from review by the institutional review board, which consisted of 1007 posteroanterior chest radiographs. The datasets were split into training (68.0%), validation (17.1%), and test (14.9%). Two different DCNNs, AlexNet and GoogLeNet, were used to classify the images as having manifestations of pulmonary TB or as healthy. Both untrained and pretrained networks on ImageNet were used, and augmentation with multiple preprocessing techniques. Ensembles were performed on the best-performing algorithms. For cases where the classifiers were in disagreement, an independent board-certified cardiothoracic radiologist blindly interpreted the images to evaluate a potential radiologist-augmented workflow. Receiver operating characteristic curves and areas under the curve (AUCs) were used to assess model performance by using the DeLong method for statistical comparison of receiver operating characteristic curves. Results The best-performing classifier had an AUC of 0.99, which was an ensemble of the AlexNet and GoogLeNet DCNNs. The AUCs of the pretrained models were greater than that of the untrained models (P < .001). Augmenting the dataset further increased accuracy (P values for AlexNet and GoogLeNet were .03 and .02, respectively). The DCNNs had disagreement in 13 of the 150 test cases, which were blindly reviewed by a cardiothoracic radiologist, who correctly interpreted all 13 cases (100%). This radiologist-augmented approach resulted in a sensitivity of 97.3% and specificity 100%. Conclusion Deep learning with DCNNs can accurately classify TB at chest radiography with an AUC of 0.99. A radiologist-augmented approach for cases where there was disagreement among the classifiers further improved accuracy. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017.",
        "History A 54-year-old woman presented with typical chest pain during physical training at the gym. She had a history of hypertension controlled with hydrochlorothiazide, without any other cardiovascular risk factor and with neither personal nor family history of ischemic heart disease. She was postmenopausal and had a long-standing history of migraine headaches without hormonal or drug therapy. The patient had no history of clinically important thoracic trauma or invasive chest interventions. Initial electrocardiography (ECG) showed signs of ongoing anterior ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, and emergent coronary angiography with angioplasty and intravascular US were performed ( Fig 1 ). Maximal level of high-sensitive T troponins was 820 ng/L (normal, <13 ng/L), while echocardiography showed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction, with no apparent regional wall motion abnormalities. General physical examination findings were unremarkable, excluding ligamentous hyperlaxity and joint instability. C-reactive protein, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, and angiotensin-converting enzyme blood test results were negative. For further evaluation, arterial phase ECG-synchronized CT angiography from the skull base to the pubis symphysis was performed ( Fig 2 ).

        "Background Choroid plexuses (CPs) have been suggested as a key gateway for inflammation in experimental autoimmune encephalitis, but in vivo evidence of their involvement in multiple sclerosis (MS) is lacking. Purpose To assess CP volumetric and inflammatory changes in patients with MS versus healthy control participants. Materials and Methods This was a secondary analysis of 97 patients (61 with relapsing-remitting MS [RRMS] and 36 with progressive MS) and 44 healthy control participants who participated in three prospective 3.0-T brain MRI studies between May 2009 and September 2017. A subgroup of 37 patients and 19 healthy control participants also underwent translocator protein fluorine 18 (18F)\u2013DPA-714 PET for neuroinflammation. Relapses and disability scores were collected at baseline and over 2 years. CPs were manually segmented on three-dimensional T1-weighted images; other brain volumes were additionally segmented. Volumes were expressed as a ratio of intracranial volume. The 18F-DPA-714 distribution volume ratio was quantified in parenchymal regions, whereas standardized uptake value was used for CP inflammation. Multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to assess CP volumetric and inflammatory differences between patients with MS and healthy control participants and correlations between CP volume and lesion load, brain volumes, 18F-DPA-714 uptake, and annualized relapse rate. Results Ninety-seven patients with MS (mean age, 42 years \u00b1 12 [standard deviation]; 49 women) and 44 healthy control participants (mean age, 39 years \u00b1 14; 23 women) underwent MRI. Thirty-seven patients with MS and 19 healthy control participants underwent PET. CPs were 35% larger in patients with MS (mean value, 15.9 \u00d7 10\u22124 \u00b1 4.5) than in healthy control participants (mean value, 11.8 \u00d7 10\u22124 \u00b1 3.8; P = .004). Subgroup analysis confirmed greater CP volume in patients with RRMS (mean value, 15.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 \u00b1 4.6; P = .008) than in healthy control participants. CP enlargement was greater in patients with active lesions at MRI (mean volume, 18.2 \u00d7 10\u22124 \u00b1 4.9 in patients with lesions that enhanced with gadolinium vs 14.9 \u00d7 10\u22124 \u00b1 4 in patients with lesions that did not enhance with gadolinium; P < .001) and correlated with white matter lesion load (r = 0.39; 95% CI: 0.20, 0.55; P < .001) and 18F-DPA-714 binding in the thalami (r = 0.44; 95% CI: 0.22, 0.72; P = .04) and normal-appearing white matter (r = 0.5; 95% CI: 0.20, 0.71; P = .005). Moreover, it correlated with annualized relapse rate in patients with RRMS (r = 0.37; 95% CI: 0.1, 0.55; P = .005). Finally, patients with MS showed 18.5% higher CP 18F-DPA-714 uptake than control participants (mean value, 0.778 \u00b1 0.23 vs 0.635 \u00b1 0.15, respectively; P = .01). CP volume in patients with RRMS (r = 0.57; 95% CI: 0.37, 0.73; P = .009) correlated with higher 18F-DPA-714 uptake. Conclusion Choroid plexuses (CPs) are enlarged and inflamed in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), particularly in those with relapsing-remitting MS with inflammatory profiles; CP volumetric analysis could represent an MS imaging marker. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 EudraCT no. 2008-004174-40; clinical trial registration nos.

        "Purpose To characterize clinically important prostate cancers missed at multiparametric (MP) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Materials and Methods The local institutional review board approved this HIPAA-compliant retrospective single-center study, which included 100 consecutive patients who had undergone MP MR imaging and subsequent radical prostatectomy. A genitourinary pathologist blinded to MP MR findings outlined prostate cancers on whole-mount pathology slices. Two readers correlated mapped lesions with reports of prospectively read MP MR images. Readers were blinded to histopathology results during prospective reading. At histopathologic examination, 80 clinically unimportant lesions (<5 mm; Gleason score, 3+3) were excluded. The same two readers, who were not blinded to histopathologic findings, retrospectively reviewed cancers missed at MP MR imaging and assigned a Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 2 score to better understand false-negative lesion characteristics. Descriptive statistics were used to define patient characteristics, including age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, PSA density, race, digital rectal examination results, and biopsy results before MR imaging. Student t test was used to determine any demographic differences between patients with false-negative MP MR imaging findings and those with correct prospective identification of all lesions. Results Of the 162 lesions, 136 (84%) were correctly identified with MP MR imaging. Size of eight lesions was underestimated. Among the 26 (16%) lesions missed at MP MR imaging, Gleason score was 3+4 in 17 (65%), 4+3 in one (4%), 4+4 in seven (27%), and 4+5 in one (4%). Retrospective PI-RADS version 2 scores were assigned (PI-RADS 1, n = 8; PI-RADS 2, n = 7; PI-RADS 3, n = 6; and PI-RADS 4, n = 5). On a per-patient basis, MP MR imaging depicted clinically important prostate cancer in 99 of 100 patients. At least one clinically important tumor was missed in 26 (26%) patients, and lesion size was underestimated in eight (8%). Conclusion Clinically important lesions can be missed or their size can be underestimated at MP MR imaging. Of missed lesions, 58% were not seen or were characterized as benign findings at second-look analysis. Recognition of the limitations of MP MR imaging is important, and new approaches to reduce this false-negative rate are needed. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "History A 68-year-old man was admitted to the hospital for work-up because of generalized fatigue, anorexia, chronic diarrhea, and weight loss. Laboratory work-up revealed an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 58 mm/h (reference range, 3-23 mm/h), a hemoglobin level of 14.1 g/dL (reference range, 13.8-17.5 g/dL), a leukocyte count of 8.1 \u00d7 109/L (reference range, [3.4-9.7] \u00d7 109/L), a platelet count of 223 \u00d7 109/L (reference range, [158-424] \u00d7 109/L), an alkaline phosphatase level of 85 U/L (1.42 \u03bckat/L) (normal level, <142 U/L [2.37 \u03bckat/L]), a serum creatinine level of 93 \u03bcmol/L (reference range, 79-125 \u03bcmol/L), a serum total protein level of 82 g/L (reference range, 66-81 g/L), a serum albumin level of 39.3 g/L (reference range, 40.2-47.6 g/L), an albumin-to-globulin ratio (a test showing relative amounts of major plasma proteins) of 0.92 (reference range, 0.8-2.0), a urine protein level of 15 mg/dL (normal level, <20 mg/dL), a total serum calcium level of 2.46 mmol/L (reference range, 2.14-2.53 mmol/L), and a carcinoembryonic antigen value of 2.69 \u03bcg/L (normal value, <3.4 \u03bcg/L). Serology findings were negative for celiac disease. Thyroid function was normal, as were 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and chromogranin A levels. Initial radiologic examination included chest radiography and plain abdominal erect radiography. Gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed to rule out inflammatory bowel disease or gastrointestinal neoplasm as a cause of chronic diarrhea. Endoscopic mucosal resection of two polyps from the cardia and duodenal bulb was performed during esophagogastroduodenoscopy, but histologic findings at hematoxylin-eosin staining were normal. Colonoscopy revealed diverticulosis involving the entire colon. Serum immunoelectrophoresis showed a monoclonal band, which was confirmed to be immunoglobulin M\u03bb at immunofixation. After histologic analysis of the bone marrow biopsy specimen, diagnosis of Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia was established, and computed tomography (CT) of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis was requested to depict lymphadenopathy and organomegaly. On the basis of CT findings, two more specimens considered highly sensitive for the CT diagnosis were obtained via minimally invasive biopsy, but the results were negative. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed a year later to control the progression of CT findings.",
        "Background Ultra-low-dose (ULD) CT could facilitate the clinical implementation of large-scale lung cancer screening while minimizing the radiation dose. However, traditional image reconstruction methods are associated with image noise in low-dose acquisitions. Purpose To compare the image quality and lung nodule detectability of deep learning image reconstruction (DLIR) and adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction-V (ASIR-V) in ULD CT. Materials and Methods Patients who underwent noncontrast ULD CT (performed at 0.07 or 0.14 mSv, similar to a single chest radiograph) and contrast-enhanced chest CT (CECT) from April to June 2020 were included in this prospective study. ULD CT images were reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP), ASIR-V, and DLIR. Three-dimensional segmentation of lung tissue was performed to evaluate image noise. Radiologists detected and measured nodules with use of a deep learning-based nodule assessment system and recognized malignancy-related imaging features. Bland-Altman analysis and repeated-measures analysis of variance were used to evaluate the differences between ULD CT images and CECT images. Results A total of 203 participants (mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 61 years \u00b1 12; 129 men) with 1066 nodules were included, with 100 scans at 0.07 mSv and 103 scans at 0.14 mSv. The mean lung tissue noise \u00b1 standard deviation was 46 HU \u00b1 4 for CECT and 59 HU \u00b1 4, 56 HU \u00b1 4, 53 HU \u00b1 4, 54 HU \u00b1 4, and 51 HU \u00b1 4 in FBP, ASIR-V level 40%, ASIR-V level 80% (ASIR-V-80%), medium-strength DLIR, and high-strength DLIR (DLIR-H), respectively, of ULD CT scans (P < .001). The nodule detection rates of FBP reconstruction, ASIR-V-80%, and DLIR-H were 62.5% (666 of 1066 nodules), 73.3% (781 of 1066 nodules), and 75.8% (808 of 1066 nodules), respectively (P < .001). Bland-Altman analysis showed the percentage difference in long diameter from that of CECT was 9.3% (95% CI of the mean: 8.0, 10.6), 9.2% (95% CI of the mean: 8.0, 10.4), and 6.2% (95% CI of the mean: 5.0, 7.4) in FBP reconstruction, ASIR-V-80%, and DLIR-H, respectively (P < .001). Conclusion Compared with adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction-V, deep learning image reconstruction reduced image noise, increased nodule detection rate, and improved measurement accuracy on ultra-low-dose chest CT images. \u00a9 RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Background Women are increasingly delaying childbearing, and thus lactation, into their 30s and 40s, when mammography would typically be the initial imaging modality to evaluate palpable masses in the general population. Current guidelines recommend US as the first-line imaging modality for palpable masses in pregnant and lactating women, but data regarding breastfeeding women age 30 years and older are near nonexistent. Purpose To evaluate the diagnostic performance of targeted US as the primary imaging modality for the evaluation of palpable masses in lactating women, including those of advanced maternal age. Materials and Methods Lactating women with palpable breast masses evaluated at targeted US over a 17-year period (January 2000 to July 2017) were retrospectively identified. All US evaluations were performed at diagnostic evaluation, and mammography was performed at the discretion of the interpreting radiologist. Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System assessments, imaging, and pathology results were collected. Descriptive statistics and 2 \u00d7 2 contingency tables were assessed at the patient level. Results There were 167 women (mean age, 35 years \u00b1 5 [standard deviation]), 101 of whom (60%) were of advanced maternal age (\u226535 years). All women underwent targeted US, and 98 (59%) underwent mammography in addition to US. The frequency of malignancy was five of 167 (3.0%). Targeted US demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity of five of five (100%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 48%, 100%) and 114 of 162 (70%; 95% CI: 63%, 77%), respectively. Negative predictive value, positive predictive value of an abnormal examination, and positive predictive value of biopsy were 114 of 114 (100%; 95% CI: 97%, 100%), five of 53 (9.4%; 95% CI: 3%, 21%), and five of 50 (10%; 95% CI: 3%, 22%), respectively. In the subset of 98 women who underwent mammography in addition to US, mammography depicted seven incidental suspicious findings, which lowered the specificity from 62 of 93 (67%; 95% CI: 56%, 76%) to 57 of 93 (61%; 95% CI: 51%, 71%) (P = .02). Conclusion Targeted US depicted all malignancies in lactating women with palpable masses. Adding mammography increased false-positive findings without any additional cancer diagnoses. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020 See also the editorial by Newell in this issue.",
        "In this retrospective study, chest CTs of 121 symptomatic patients infected with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) from four centers in China from January 18, 2020 to February 2, 2020 were reviewed for common CT findings in relationship to the time between symptom onset and the initial CT scan (i.e. early, 0-2 days (36 patients), intermediate 3-5 days (33 patients), late 6-12 days (25 patients)). The hallmarks of COVID-19 infection on imaging were bilateral and peripheral ground-glass and consolidative pulmonary opacities. Notably, 20/36 (56%) of early patients had a normal CT. With a longer time after the onset of symptoms, CT findings were more frequent, including consolidation, bilateral and peripheral disease, greater total lung involvement, linear opacities, \"crazy-paving\" pattern and the \"reverse halo\" sign.

        "Background Brain MRI parenchymal signal abnormalities have been associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Purpose To describe the neuroimaging findings (excluding ischemic infarcts) in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Materials and Methods This was a retrospective study of patients evaluated from March 23, 2020, to April 27, 2020, at 16 hospitals. Inclusion criteria were (a) positive nasopharyngeal or lower respiratory tract reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays, (b) severe COVID-19 infection defined as a requirement for hospitalization and oxygen therapy, (c) neurologic manifestations, and (d) abnormal brain MRI findings. Exclusion criteria were patients with missing or noncontributory data regarding brain MRI or brain MRI showing ischemic infarcts, cerebral venous thrombosis, or chronic lesions unrelated to the current event. Categorical data were compared using the Fisher exact test. Quantitative data were compared using the Student t test or Wilcoxon test. P < .05 represented a significant difference. Results Thirty men (81%) and seven women (19%) met the inclusion criteria, with a mean age of 61 years \u00b1 12 (standard deviation) (age range, 8-78 years). The most common neurologic manifestations were alteration of consciousness (27 of 37, 73%), abnormal wakefulness when sedation was stopped (15 of 37, 41%), confusion (12 of 37, 32%), and agitation (seven of 37, 19%). The most frequent MRI findings were signal abnormalities located in the medial temporal lobe in 16 of 37 patients (43%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 27%, 59%), nonconfluent multifocal white matter hyperintense lesions seen with fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion-weighted sequences with variable enhancement, with associated hemorrhagic lesions in 11 of 37 patients (30%; 95% CI: 15%, 45%), and extensive and isolated white matter microhemorrhages in nine of 37 patients (24%; 95% CI: 10%, 38%). A majority of patients (20 of 37, 54%) had intracerebral hemorrhagic lesions with a more severe clinical presentation and a higher admission rate in intensive care units (20 of 20 patients [100%] vs 12 of 17 patients without hemorrhage [71%], P = .01) and development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (20 of 20 patients [100%] vs 11 of 17 patients [65%], P = .005).

        "Purpose To compare the diagnostic performance of ultrasonography (US)-based fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) criteria from seven international societies in the detection of thyroid malignancy. Materials and Methods This study included a total of 2000 consecutive thyroid nodules (\u22651 cm) in 1802 patients with final diagnoses from January 2010 to May 2011. US features of the thyroid nodules were retrospectively reviewed and were classified according to the categories defined by the seven international society guidelines. The diagnostic performance of US-based FNAB criteria in the detection of thyroid malignancy and unnecessary FNAB rates were calculated and compared by using a generalized estimating equation method. Results Of the 2000 thyroid nodules, 1546 (78.3%) were benign and 454 (22.7%) were malignant, with papillary carcinoma comprising 85.5% of all malignancies. The Korean Thyroid Association/Korean Society of Thyroid Radiology (KTA/KSThR) (94.5%), National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) (92.5%), and American Thyroid Association (ATA) (89.6%) guidelines were more sensitive than those of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology/Associazione Medici Endocrinologi (AACE/ACE/AME) (80.4%), American College of Radiology (ACR) (74.7%), French Society of Endocrinology (FSE) (72.7%), and Society of Radiology in Ultrasound (SRU) (70.9%) (P < .001), while the latter guidelines had higher specificity (P < .001). The rate of unnecessary FNAB was lowest with the ACR guidelines (25.3%), followed by the FSE (29.1%), AACE/ACE/AME (32.5%), SRU (45.2%), ATA (51.7%), NCCN (54.0%), and KTA/KSThR (56.9%) guidelines. Conclusion Because the diagnostic performance of US-based FNAB criteria varies according to the individual international society guidelines, clinicians should be aware of the strengths and weaknesses of US-based FNAB criteria in the management of thyroid nodules. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "HistoryA 55-year-old man with a history of chronic pancreatitis secondary to chronic alcohol abuse presented to the hospital with acute abdominal pain, generalized weakness, weight loss, and pyrexia. A clinical examination revealed he was tender to touch in the upper abdomen. Laboratory tests revealed a serum alkaline phosphatase level of 370 U/L (6.1 \u00b5kat/L) (normal range, 30-130 U/L [0.5-2.2 \u00b5kat/L]), a lipase level of 172 U/L (2.9 \u00b5kat/L) (normal range, 0-60 U/L [0-1.0 \u00b5kat/L]), a C-reactive protein level of 159 mg/L (1514 nmol/L) (normal value, <8.0 mg/L [76.2 nmol/L]), and a white cell count of 7 \u00d7 109/L (normal range, [4-11] \u00d7 109/L). During the present admission, the patient underwent urgent CT for his acute symptoms. His relevant medical history included a hospital admission 2 months earlier for abdominal discomfort.

        "Background Deep learning (DL) algorithms are gaining extensive attention for their excellent performance in image recognition tasks. DL models can automatically make a quantitative assessment of complex medical image characteristics and achieve increased accuracy in diagnosis with higher efficiency. Purpose To determine the feasibility of using a DL approach to predict clinically negative axillary lymph node metastasis from US images in patients with primary breast cancer. Materials and Methods A data set of US images in patients with primary breast cancer with clinically negative axillary lymph nodes from Tongji Hospital (974 imaging studies from 2016 to 2018, 756 patients) and an independent test set from Hubei Cancer Hospital (81 imaging studies from 2018 to 2019, 78 patients) were collected. Axillary lymph node status was confirmed with pathologic examination. Three different convolutional neural networks (CNNs) of Inception V3, Inception-ResNet V2, and ResNet-101 architectures were trained on 90% of the Tongji Hospital data set and tested on the remaining 10%, as well as on the independent test set. The performance of the models was compared with that of five radiologists. The models' performance was analyzed in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristic curves, areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs), and heat maps. Results The best-performing CNN model, Inception V3, achieved an AUC of 0.89 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.83, 0.95) in the prediction of the final clinical diagnosis of axillary lymph node metastasis in the independent test set. The model achieved 85% sensitivity (35 of 41 images; 95% CI: 70%, 94%) and 73% specificity (29 of 40 images; 95% CI: 56%, 85%), and the radiologists achieved 73% sensitivity (30 of 41 images; 95% CI: 57%, 85%; P = .17) and 63% specificity (25 of 40 images; 95% CI: 46%, 77%; P = .34). Conclusion Using US images from patients with primary breast cancer, deep learning models can effectively predict clinically negative axillary lymph node metastasis. Artificial intelligence may provide an early diagnostic strategy for lymph node metastasis in patients with breast cancer with clinically negative lymph nodes. Published under a CC BY 4.0 license.

        "Background Post-COVID-19 condition encompasses symptoms following COVID-19 infection that linger at least 4 weeks after the end of active infection. Symptoms are wide ranging, but breathlessness is common. Purpose To determine if the previously described lung abnormalities seen on hyperpolarized (HP) pulmonary xenon 129 (129Xe) MRI scans in participants with post-COVID-19 condition who were hospitalized are also present in participants with post-COVID-19 condition who were not hospitalized. Materials and Methods In this prospective study, nonhospitalized participants with post-COVID-19 condition (NHLC) and posthospitalized participants with post-COVID-19 condition (PHC) were enrolled from June 2020 to August 2021. Participants underwent chest CT, HP 129Xe MRI, pulmonary function testing, and the 1-minute sit-to-stand test and completed breathlessness questionnaires. Control subjects underwent HP 129Xe MRI only. CT scans were analyzed for post-COVID-19 interstitial lung disease severity using a previously published scoring system and full-scale airway network (FAN) modeling. Analysis used group and pairwise comparisons between participants and control subjects and correlations between participant clinical and imaging data. Results A total of 11 NHLC participants (four men, seven women; mean age, 44 years \u00b1 11 [SD]; 95% CI: 37, 50) and 12 PHC participants (10 men, two women; mean age, 58 years \u00b110; 95% CI: 52, 64) were included, with a significant difference in age between groups (P = .05). Mean time from infection was 287 days \u00b1 79 (95% CI: 240, 334) and 143 days \u00b1 72 (95% CI: 105, 190) in NHLC and PHC participants, respectively. NHLC and PHC participants had normal or near normal CT scans (mean, 0.3/25 \u00b1 0.6 [95% CI: 0, 0.63] and 7/25 \u00b1 5 [95% CI: 4, 10], respectively). Gas transfer (Dlco) was different between NHLC and PHC participants (mean Dlco, 76% \u00b1 8 [95% CI: 73, 83] vs 86% \u00b1 8 [95% CI: 80, 91], respectively; P = .04), but there was no evidence of other differences in lung function. Mean red blood cell-to-tissue plasma ratio was different between volunteers (mean, 0.45 \u00b1 0.07; 95% CI: 0.43, 0.47]) and PHC participants (mean, 0.31 \u00b1 0.10; 95% CI: 0.24, 0.37; P = .02) and between volunteers and NHLC participants (mean, 0.37 \u00b1 0.10; 95% CI: 0.31, 0.44; P = .03) but not between NHLC and PHC participants (P = .26). FAN results did not correlate with Dlco) or HP 129Xe MRI results. Conclusion Nonhospitalized participants with post-COVID-19 condition (NHLC) and posthospitalized participants with post-COVID-19 condition (PHC) showed hyperpolarized pulmonary xenon 129 MRI and red blood cell-to-tissue plasma abnormalities, with NHLC participants demonstrating lower gas transfer than PHC participants despite having normal CT findings. \u00a9 RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Background Tumor-like cortical irregularities at the posterior distal femur are common incidental findings in adolescents, but the origin of these irregularities is debated. Purpose To compare the prevalence of distal femoral cortical irregularities (DFCIs) at different tendon attachment sites in youth competitive alpine skiers with that in young adults. Materials and Methods In this secondary analysis of a prospective trial, unenhanced 3-T knee MRI scans obtained in youth competitive alpine skiers were compared with images in control participants of the same age from 2014 to 2019 (Cantonal Ethics Committee Zurich registry number: KEK-ZH-2017-01395) for presence of DFCIs at the femoral attachment of the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle (MHG) and/or lateral head of the gastrocnemius muscle (LHG) and adductor magnus tendon by two radiologists. DFCI size and tendon attachment position were measured. Tendon attachment position and associated MRI findings (meniscus, cartilage, bone marrow edema, joint effusion, ligaments, tendons) were examined for an association with DFCI. Pearson \u03c72, Student t test, logistic regression, and \u03ba statistics were applied. Results Unilateral knee MRI scans obtained in 105 skiers (mean age, 14.8 years \u00b1 0.6 [standard deviation]; 66 boys) and in 105 control participants (mean age, 14.6 years \u00b1 0.5; 59 boys) were evaluated. DFCIs were found in 61 of 105 skiers (58%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 48.5%, 67.2%) compared with 28 of 105 control participants (27%; 95% CI: 18.9%, 35.7%) (P < .001). Two skiers had more than one DFCI. Distribution of DFCIs for skiers and control participants was 60 of 63 (95.2%) and 26 of 28 (92.8%) at the MHG, three of 63 (4.8%) and one of 28 (3.6%) at the LHG, and zero of 63 (0%) and one of 28 (3.6%) at the adductor magnus attachment site, respectively. Interreader agreement was almost perfect (\u03ba = 0.87; 95% CI: 0.80, 0.93). The mean size of MHG-related DFCIs in skiers (3.7 mm) was not different compared to the size of those in control participants (3.4 mm) (P = .32), nor was a difference found for the MHG tendon attachment position in knees with DFCI (63.9 mm vs 63.0 mm, P = .83) or without DFCI (63.6 mm vs 62.8 mm, P = .86). Regarding associated MRI findings, increased signal intensity of the MHG tendon showed a significant association with MHG-related DFCI in both groups (P = .01 for both). Conclusion A distal femoral cortical irregularity at the attachment sites of tendons was a frequent incidental finding on knee MRI scans, with an increased prevalence in youth competitive alpine skiers. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Background The Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System (O-RADS) US risk stratification and management system (O-RADS US) was designed to improve risk assessment and management of ovarian and adnexal lesions. Validation studies including both surgical and nonsurgical treatment as the reference standard remain lacking. Purpose To externally validate O-RADS US in women who underwent either surgical or nonsurgical treatment and to determine if incorporating acoustic shadowing as a benign finding improves diagnostic performance. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included consecutive women who underwent pelvic US between August 2015 and April 2017 at a tertiary referral oncology center. Two independent readers blinded to clinical and histologic outcome assigned an O-RADS risk category and an International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) Assessment of Different NEoplasias in the adneXa (ADNEX) model risk of malignancy score to assessable lesions. Reference standards were surgical histopathology or 2-year imaging follow-up. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate performance of the O-RADS US, ADNEX, and modified O-RADS models incorporating acoustic shadowing. Results In total, 227 women (mean age, 52 years \u00b1 16 [SD]) with 262 ovarian or adnexal lesions were evaluated. Of these lesions, 187 (71%) were benign and 75 (29%) were malignant. The proportion of malignancy was 0% (0 of 100) for O-RADS 2, 3% (one of 32) for O-RADS 3, 35% (22 of 63) for O-RADS 4, and 78% (52 of 67) for O-RADS 5. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for O-RADS and ADNEX was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.88, 0.94) and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.92, 0.97; P = .01), respectively. The addition of acoustic shadowing as a benign finding improved O-RADS AUC to 0.94 (95% CI: 0.91, 0.96; P = .01). Use of O-RADS 4 as a threshold yielded a sensitivity of 99% (74 of 75; 95% CI: 96, 100) and a specificity of 70% (131 of 187; 95% CI: 64, 77). Conclusion In a tertiary referral oncology center, the Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System US risk stratification and management system enabled accurate distinction of benign from malignant ovarian and adnexal lesions. Adding acoustic shadowing as a benign finding improved its diagnostic performance. \u00a9 RSNA, 2022 See also the editorial by Levine in this issue.",
        "Purpose To compare gadolinium tissue concentrations of multiple linear and macrocyclic chelates in a rat model to better understand the scope and extent of tissue deposition following multiple intravenous doses of gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA). Materials and Methods In this Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved study, healthy rats received 20 intravenous injections of 2.5 mmol gadolinium per kilogram (gadolinium-exposed group) or saline (control group) over a 26-day period. Unenhanced T1 signal intensities of the dentate nucleus were measured from magnetic resonance (MR) images obtained prior to GBCA injection and 3 days after final injection. Rat brain and renal, hepatic, and splenic tissues were harvested 7 days after final injection and subjected to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and transmission electron microscopy for quantification and characterization of gadolinium deposits. Results Gadolinium deposition in brain tissue significantly varied with GBCA type (F = 31.2; P < .0001), with median concentrations of 0 \u03bcg gadolinium per gram of tissue (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0, 0.2) in gadoteridol-injected rats, 1.6 \u03bcg gadolinium per gram of tissue (95% CI: 0.9, 4.7) in gadobutrol-injected rats, 4.7 \u03bcg gadolinium per gram of tissue (95% CI: 3.5, 6.1) in gadobenate dimeglumine-injected rats, and 6.9 \u03bcg gadolinium per gram of tissue (95% CI: 6.2, 7.0) in gadodiamide-injected rats; a significant positive dose-signal intensity correlation was identified (\u03c1 = 0.93; P < .0001). No detectable neural tissue deposition or MR imaging signal was observed in control rats (n = 6). Similar relative differences in gadolinium deposition were observed in renal, hepatic, and splenic tissues at much higher tissue concentrations (P < .0001). Gadolinium deposits were visualized directly in the endothelial capillary walls and neural interstitium in GBCA-injected rats, but not in control rats. Conclusion Tissue deposition of gadolinium was two- to fourfold higher following administration of the linear agents gadodiamide and gadobenate dimeglumine compared with the macrocyclic agents gadobutrol and gadoteridol. These findings suggest that organ tissue deposition is reduced but not eliminated following administration of macrocyclic GBCA chelates in lieu of linear chelates. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "History A 38-year-old man who had been in a motor vehicle collision was referred to our institute. He was suspected of having left-sided pneumothorax. This necessitated intercostal drainage with a chest tube, which had been placed elsewhere prior to his arrival. Paraparesis was noted on the initial clinical examination, with adequately maintained vital signs, while the blood work-up revealed a mildly reduced hemoglobin level of 10.1 mg/dL (normal range, 13.8-17.2 mg/dL); however, the rest of the laboratory values were within normal limits (Figs 1-5). The patient was then immediately referred for further evaluation with CT of the brain, cervical spine, and thorax. Thereafter, serial chest radiography was performed for follow-up.",

        "Background Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and its consequences are a growing public health concern requiring cross-sectional imaging for noninvasive diagnosis and quantification of liver fat. Purpose To investigate a deep learning\u2013based automated liver fat quantification tool at nonenhanced CT for establishing the prevalence of steatosis in a large screening cohort. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, a fully automated liver segmentation algorithm was applied to noncontrast abdominal CT examinations from consecutive asymptomatic adults by using three-dimensional convolutional neural networks, including a subcohort with follow-up scans. Automated volume-based liver attenuation was analyzed, including conversion to CT fat fraction, and compared with manual measurement in a large subset of scans. Results A total of 11 669 CT scans in 9552 adults (mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 57.2 years \u00b1 7.9; 5314 women and 4238 men; median body mass index [BMI], 27.8 kg/m2) were evaluated, including 2117 follow-up scans in 1862 adults (mean age, 59.2 years; 971 women and 891 men; mean interval, 5.5 years). Algorithm failure occurred in seven scans. Mean CT liver attenuation was 55 HU \u00b1 10, corresponding to CT fat fraction of 6.4% (slightly fattier in men than in women [7.4% \u00b1 6.0 vs 5.8% \u00b1 5.7%; P < .001]). Mean liver Hounsfield unit varied little by age (<4 HU difference among all age groups) and only weak correlation was seen with BMI (r2 = 0.14). By category, 47.9% (5584 of 11 669) had negligible or no liver fat (CT fat fraction <5%), 42.4% (4948 of 11 669) had mild steatosis (CT fat fraction of 5%\u201314%), 8.8% (1025 of 11 669) had moderate steatosis (CT fat fraction of 14%\u201328%), and 1% (112 of 11 669) had severe steatosis (CT fat fraction >28%). Excellent agreement was seen between automated and manual measurements, with a mean difference of 2.7 HU (median, 3 HU) and r2 of 0.92. Among the subcohort with longitudinal follow-up, mean change was only \u22123 HU \u00b1 9, but 43.3% (806 of 1861) of patients changed steatosis category between first and last scans. Conclusion This fully automated CT-based liver fat quantification tool allows for population-based assessment of hepatic steatosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, with objective data that match well with manual measurement. The prevalence of at least mild steatosis was greater than 50% in this asymptomatic screening cohort. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019",
        "Purpose To identify the reproducible and nonredundant radiomics features (RFs) for computed tomography (CT). Materials and Methods Two phantoms were used to test RF reproducibility by using test-retest analysis, by changing the CT acquisition parameters (hereafter, intra-CT analysis), and by comparing five different scanners with the same CT parameters (hereafter, inter-CT analysis). Reproducible RFs were selected by using the concordance correlation coefficient (as a measure of the agreement between variables) and the coefficient of variation (defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean). Redundant features were grouped by using hierarchical cluster analysis. Results A total of 177 RFs including intensity, shape, and texture features were evaluated. The test-retest analysis showed that 91% (161 of 177) of the RFs were reproducible according to concordance correlation coefficient. Reproducibility of intra-CT RFs, based on coefficient of variation, ranged from 89.3% (151 of 177) to 43.1% (76 of 177) where the pitch factor and the reconstruction kernel were modified, respectively. Reproducibility of inter-CT RFs, based on coefficient of variation, also showed large material differences, from 85.3% (151 of 177; wood) to only 15.8% (28 of 177; polyurethane). Ten clusters were identified after the hierarchical cluster analysis and one RF per cluster was chosen as representative. Conclusion Many RFs were redundant and nonreproducible. If all the CT parameters are fixed except field of view, tube voltage, and milliamperage, then the information provided by the analyzed RFs can be summarized in only 10 RFs (each representing a cluster) because of redundancy.",
        "Purpose To identify cerebral radiomic features related to diagnosis and subtyping of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and to build and evaluate classification models for ADHD diagnosis and subtyping on the basis of the identified features. Materials and Methods A consecutive cohort of 83 age- and sex-matched children with newly diagnosed and never-treated ADHD (mean age 10.83 years \u00b1 2.30; range, 7\u201314 years; 71 boys, 40 with ADHD-inattentive [ADHD-I] and 43 with ADHD-combined [ADHD-C, or inattentive and hyperactive]) and 87 healthy control subjects (mean age, 11.21 years \u00b1 2.51; range, 7\u201315 years; 72 boys) underwent anatomic and diffusion-tensor magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Features representing the shape properties of gray matter and diffusion properties of white matter were extracted for each participant. The initial feature set was input into an all-relevant feature selection procedure within cross-validation loops to identify features with significant discriminative power for diagnosis and subtyping. Random forest classifiers were constructed and evaluated on the basis of identified features. Results No overall difference was found between children with ADHD and control subjects in total brain volume (1069830.00 mm3 \u00b1 90743.36 vs 1079 213.00 mm3 \u00b1 92742.25, respectively; P = .51) or total gray and white matter volume (611978.10 mm3 \u00b1 51622.81 vs 616960.20 mm3 \u00b1 51872.93, respectively; P = .53; 413532.00 mm3 \u00b1 41 114.33 vs 418173.60 mm3 \u00b1 42395.48, respectively; P = .47). The mean classification accuracy achieved with classifiers to discriminate patients with ADHD from control subjects was 73.7%. Alteration in cortical shape in the left temporal lobe, bilateral cuneus, and regions around the left central sulcus contributed significantly to group discrimination. The mean classification accuracy with classifiers to discriminate ADHD-I from ADHD-C was 80.1%, with significant discriminating features located in the default mode network and insular cortex. Conclusion The results of this study provide preliminary evidence that cerebral morphometric alterations can allow discrimination between patients with ADHD and control subjects and also between the most common ADHD subtypes. By identifying features relevant for diagnosis and subtyping, these findings may advance the understanding of neurodevelopmental alterations related to ADHD. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To evaluate a radiomics model for predicting lymph node (LN) metastasis in biliary tract cancers (BTCs) and to determine its prognostic value for disease-specific and recurrence-free survival. Materials and Methods For this retrospective study, a radiomics model was developed on the basis of a primary cohort of 177 patients with BTC who underwent resection and LN dissection between June 2010 and December 2016. Radiomic features were extracted from portal venous CT scans. A radiomics signature was built on the basis of reproducible features by using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method. Multivariable logistic regression model was adopted to establish a radiomics nomogram. Nomogram performance was determined by its discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness. The model was internally validated in 70 consecutive patients with BTC between January 2017 and February 2018. Results The radiomics signature, composed of three LN-status\u2013related features, was associated with LN metastasis in primary and validation cohorts (P < .001). The radiomics nomogram that incorporated radiomics signature and CT-reported LN status showed good calibration and discrimination in primary cohort (area under the curve, 0.81) and validation cohort (area under the curve, 0.80). Patients at high risk of LN metastasis portended lower disease-specific and recurrence-free survival than did those at low risk after surgery (both P < .001). High-risk LN metastasis was an independent preoperative predictor of disease-specific survival (hazard ratio, 3.37; P < .001) and recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio, 1.98; P = .003). Conclusion A radiomics model derived from portal phase CT of the liver has good performance for predicting lymph node metastasis in biliary tract cancer and may help to improve clinical decision making. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Background In the first (prevalent) supplemental MRI screening round of the Dense Tissue and Early Breast Neoplasm Screening (DENSE) trial, a considerable number of breast cancers were found at the cost of an increased false-positive rate (FPR). In incident screening rounds, a lower cancer detection rate (CDR) is expected due to a smaller pool of prevalent cancers, and a reduced FPR, due to the availability of prior MRI examinations. Purpose To investigate screening performance indicators of the second round (incidence round) of the DENSE trial. Materials and Methods The DENSE trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01315015) is embedded within the Dutch population-based biennial mammography screening program for women aged 50-75 years. MRI examinations were performed between December 2011 and January 2016. Women were eligible for the second round when they again had a negative screening mammogram 2 years after their first MRI. The recall rate, biopsy rate, CDR, FPR, positive predictive values, and distributions of tumor characteristics were calculated and compared with results of the first round using 95% CIs and \u03c72 tests. Results A total of 3436 women (median age, 56 years; interquartile range, 48-64 years) underwent a second MRI screening. The CDR was 5.8 per 1000 screening examinations (95% CI: 3.8, 9.0) compared with 16.5 per 1000 screening examinations (95% CI: 13.3, 20.5) in the first round. The FPR was 26.3 per 1000 screening examinations (95% CI: 21.5, 32.3) in the second round versus 79.8 per 1000 screening examinations (95% CI: 72.4, 87.9) in the first round. The positive predictive value for recall was 18% (20 of 110 participants recalled; 95% CI: 12.1, 26.4), and the positive predictive value for biopsy was 24% (20 of 84 participants who underwent biopsy; 95% CI: 16.0, 33.9), both comparable to that of the first round. All tumors in the second round were stage 0-I and node negative. Conclusion The incremental cancer detection rate in the second round was 5.8 per 1000 screening examinations-compared with 16.5 per 1000 screening examinations in the first round. This was accompanied by a strong reduction in the number of false-positive results. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Purpose To compare the rates of acute kidney injury (AKI), emergent dialysis, and short-term mortality between patients who underwent intravenous administration of the iso-osmolar contrast material (IOCM) iodixanol 320 and patients who underwent a noncontrast computed tomography (CT) examination. Materials and Methods Study design and implementation were overseen by an institutional review board and conformed to HIPAA guidelines on patient data integrity. All patients who underwent an iodixanol-enhanced (IOCM group) or a noncontrast (noncontrast group) CT examination from January 2003 to December 2014 were identified. Patients were subdivided into subgroups of those with stage 1\u20132 chronic kidney disease (CKD) (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], \u2265 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), those with stage 3 CKD (eGFR, 30\u201359 mL/min/1.73 m2), and those with stage 4\u20135 CKD (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and separately underwent propensity score stratification and matching. Rates of AKI, emergent dialysis, and mortality were compared between IOCM and noncontrast groups. Additional analyses incorporating intravenous fluid administration, including additional CT studies at other sites within a single institution, and a paired analysis of patients who underwent both IOCM and noncontrast CT studies during the study time frame, were also performed. Results A total of 5758 patients (1538 with stage 1\u20132 CKD, 2899 with stage 3 CKD, and 1321 with stage 4\u20135 CKD) were included in the study. After propensity score adjustment, rates of AKI, dialysis, and mortality were not significantly higher in the IOCM group compared with the noncontrast group for all CKD subgroups (AKI odds ratios [ORs], 0.74\u20130.91, P = .16\u20130.69; dialysis ORs, 0.74\u20132.00, P = .42\u2013.76; mortality ORs, 0.98\u20131.24, P = .39\u2013.88). Sensitivity analyses yielded similar results. Conclusion Among patients at the highest perceived risk of postcontrast AKI, intravenous administration of iodixanol for contrast material enhanced CT was not an independent risk factor for AKI, dialysis, or mortality. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To determine the feasibility of using a deep learning approach to detect cartilage lesions (including cartilage softening, fibrillation, fissuring, focal defects, diffuse thinning due to cartilage degeneration, and acute cartilage injury) within the knee joint on MR images. Materials and Methods A fully automated deep learning-based cartilage lesion detection system was developed by using segmentation and classification convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Fat-suppressed T2-weighted fast spin-echo MRI data sets of the knee of 175 patients with knee pain were retrospectively analyzed by using the deep learning method. The reference standard for training the CNN classification was the interpretation provided by a fellowship-trained musculoskeletal radiologist of the presence or absence of a cartilage lesion within 17 395 small image patches placed on the articular surfaces of the femur and tibia. Receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis and the \u03ba statistic were used to assess diagnostic performance and intraobserver agreement for detecting cartilage lesions for two individual evaluations performed by the cartilage lesion detection system. Results The sensitivity and specificity of the cartilage lesion detection system at the optimal threshold according to the Youden index were 84.1% and 85.2%, respectively, for evaluation 1 and 80.5% and 87.9%, respectively, for evaluation 2. Areas under the ROC curve were 0.917 and 0.914 for evaluations 1 and 2, respectively, indicating high overall diagnostic accuracy for detecting cartilage lesions. There was good intraobserver agreement between the two individual evaluations, with a \u03ba of 0.76. Conclusion This study demonstrated the feasibility of using a fully automated deep learning-based cartilage lesion detection system to evaluate the articular cartilage of the knee joint with high diagnostic performance and good intraobserver agreement for detecting cartilage degeneration and acute cartilage injury. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article .",
        "Purpose To develop and validate a deep learning system (DLS) for staging liver fibrosis by using CT images in the liver. Materials and Methods DLS for CT-based staging of liver fibrosis was created by using a development data set that included portal venous phase CT images in 7461 patients with pathologically confirmed liver fibrosis. The diagnostic performance of the DLS was evaluated in separate test data sets for 891 patients. The influence of patient characteristics and CT techniques on the staging accuracy of the DLS was evaluated by logistic regression analysis. In a subset of 421 patients, the diagnostic performance of the DLS was compared with that of the radiologist's assessment, aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI), and fibrosis-4 index by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and Obuchowski index. Results In the test data sets, the DLS had a staging accuracy of 79.4% (707 of 891) and an AUROC of 0.96, 0.97, and 0.95 for diagnosing significant fibrosis (F2\u20134), advanced fibrosis (F3\u20134), and cirrhosis (F4), respectively. At multivariable analysis, only pathologic fibrosis stage significantly affected the staging accuracy of the DLS (P = .016 and .013 for F1 and F2, respectively, compared with F4), whereas etiology of liver disease and CT technique did not. The DLS (Obuchowski index, 0.94) outperformed the radiologist's interpretation, APRI, and fibrosis-4 index (Obuchowski index range, 0.71\u20130.81; P \u02c2 .001) for staging liver fibrosis. Conclusion The deep learning system allows for accurate staging of liver fibrosis by using CT images. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",

        "Purpose To evaluate ability of radiomic (computer-extracted imaging) features to distinguish non-small cell lung cancer adenocarcinomas from granulomas at noncontrast CT. Materials and Methods For this retrospective study, screening or standard diagnostic noncontrast CT images were collected for 290 patients (mean age, 68 years; range, 18\u201392 years; 125 men [mean age, 67 years; range, 18\u201390 years] and 165 women [mean age, 68 years; range, 33\u201392 years]) from two institutions between 2007 and 2013. Histopathologic analysis was available for one nodule per patient. Corresponding nodule of interest was identified on axial CT images by a radiologist with manual annotation. Nodule shape, wavelet (Gabor), and texture-based (Haralick and Laws energy) features were extracted from intra- and perinodular regions. Features were pruned to train machine learning classifiers with 145 patients. In a test set of 145 patients, classifier results were compared against a convolutional neural network (CNN) and diagnostic readings of two radiologists. Results Support vector machine classifier with intranodular radiomic features achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.75 on the test set. Combining radiomics of intranodular with perinodular regions improved the AUC to 0.80. On the same test set, CNN resulted in an AUC of 0.76. Radiologist readers achieved AUCs of 0.61 and 0.60, respectively. Conclusion Radiomic features from intranodular and perinodular regions of nodules can distinguish non-small cell lung cancer adenocarcinomas from benign granulomas at noncontrast CT. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Background Gallium 68 (68Ga)\u2013labeled fibroblast-activation protein inhibitor (FAPI) has recently been introduced as a promising tumor imaging agent. Purpose To compare 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT with fluorine 18 (18F)\u2013labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT in evaluating lung cancer. Materials and Methods In this prospective study conducted from September 2020 to February 2021, images from participants with lung cancer who underwent both 68Ga-FAPI and 18F-FDG PET/CT examinations were analyzed. The tracer uptakes, quantified by maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and target-to-background ratio (TBR), were compared for paired positive lesions between both modalities using the paired t test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results Thirty-four participants (median age, 64 years [interquartile range: 46\u201380 years]; 20 men) were evaluated. From visual evaluation, 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT showed similar performance in the delineation of primary tumors and detection of suspected metastases in the lungs, liver, and adrenal glands. The metabolic tumor volume in primary and recurrent lung tumors showed no difference between modalities (mean: 11.6 vs 10.8, respectively; P = .68). However, compared with 18F-FDG PET/CT, 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT depicted more suspected metastases in lymph nodes (356 vs 320), brain (23 vs 10), bone (109 vs 91), and pleura (66 vs 35). From semiquantitative evaluation, the SUVmax and TBR of primary or recurrent tumors, positive lymph nodes, bone lesions, and pleural lesions at 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT were all higher than those at 18F-FDG PET/CT (all P < .01). Although SUVmax of 68Ga-FAPI and 18F-FDG in brain metastases were not different (mean SUVmax: 9.0 vs 7.4, P = .32), TBR was higher with 68Ga-FAPI than with 18F-FDG (mean: 314.4 vs 1.0, P = .02). Conclusion Gallium 68\u2013labeled fibroblast-activation protein inhibitor PET/CT may outperform fluorine 18\u2013labeled fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT in staging lung cancer, particularly in the detection of metastasis to the brain, lymph nodes, bone, and pleura. \u00a9 RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Purpose To investigate diagnostic performance by using a deep learning method with a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the differentiation of liver masses at dynamic contrast agent-enhanced computed tomography (CT). Materials and Methods This clinical retrospective study used CT image sets of liver masses over three phases (noncontrast-agent enhanced, arterial, and delayed). Masses were diagnosed according to five categories (category A, classic hepatocellular carcinomas [HCCs]; category B, malignant liver tumors other than classic and early HCCs; category C, indeterminate masses or mass-like lesions [including early HCCs and dysplastic nodules] and rare benign liver masses other than hemangiomas and cysts; category D, hemangiomas; and category E, cysts). Supervised training was performed by using 55 536 image sets obtained in 2013 (from 460 patients, 1068 sets were obtained and they were augmented by a factor of 52 [rotated, parallel-shifted, strongly enlarged, and noise-added images were generated from the original images]). The CNN was composed of six convolutional, three maximum pooling, and three fully connected layers. The CNN was tested with 100 liver mass image sets obtained in 2016 (74 men and 26 women; mean age, 66.4 years \u00b1 10.6 [standard deviation]; mean mass size, 26.9 mm \u00b1 25.9; 21, nine, 35, 20, and 15 liver masses for categories A, B, C, D, and E, respectively). Training and testing were performed five times. Accuracy for categorizing liver masses with CNN model and the area under receiver operating characteristic curve for differentiating categories A-B versus categories C-E were calculated. Results Median accuracy of differential diagnosis of liver masses for test data were 0.84. Median area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for differentiating categories A-B from C-E was 0.92. Conclusion Deep learning with CNN showed high diagnostic performance in differentiation of liver masses at dynamic CT. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Multifoetal gestations present a serious public health challenge due to its unique complications. Research findings in this regard especially in the setting of this study are scarce. The adoption of prenatal ultrasound for this study is because it is safe, available and does not employ ionising radiation.An initial 500 which was increased to 2,000 consenting patients but which reduced to 1989 due to attrition were scanned twice (after 10weeks GA and from 28weeks GA) over a 2 year period. The initial increase was to improve the power of the findings. 85 patients had multiple gestations.The prevalence rate was 4.3% with a rate of 41 per 1000 and 2 per 1000 deliveries in twin and triplets respectively. Increasing age, positive family history and fertility treatment were established predisposing factors to multiple pregnancies. 10 cases of foetal complications were observed. 8(80%) of these cases were found in patients on assisted reproductory treatment whereas 2(20%) were found in the naturally conceiving ones. The remaining 75 had no complications. Similarly, maternal complications occurred more in the patients on assisted reproductory treatment (51.8%) as against 48.2% in the latter group.",
        "Background In multiple sclerosis (MS), gray matter (GM) atrophy exhibits a specific pattern, which correlates strongly with clinical disability. However, the mechanism of regional specificity in GM atrophy remains largely unknown. Recently, the network degeneration hypothesis (NDH) was quantitatively defined (using coordinate-based meta-analysis) as the atrophy-based functional network (AFN) model, which posits that localized GM atrophy in MS is mediated by functional networks. Purpose To test the NDH in MS in a data-driven manner using the AFN model to direct analyses in an independent test sample. Materials and Methods Model fit testing was conducted with structural equation modeling, which is based on the computation of semipartial correlations. Model verification was performed in coordinate-based data of healthy control participants from the BrainMap database (https://www.brainmap.org). Model validation was conducted in prospectively acquired resting-state functional MRI in participants with relapsing-remitting MS who were recruited between September 2018 and January 2019. Correlation analyses of model fit indices and volumetric measures with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores and disease duration were performed. Results Model verification of healthy control participants included 80 194 coordinates from 9035 experiments. Model verification in healthy control data resulted in excellent model fit (root mean square error of approximation, 0.037; 90% CI: 0.036, 0.039). Twenty participants (mean age, 36 years \u00b1 9 [standard deviation]; 12 women) with relapsing-remitting MS were evaluated. Model validation in resting-state functional MRI in participants with MS resulted in deviation from optimal model fit (root mean square error of approximation, 0.071; 90% CI: 0.070, 0.072), which correlated with EDSS scores (r = 0.68; P = .002). Conclusion The atrophy-based functional network model predicts functional network disruption in multiple sclerosis (MS), thereby supporting the network degeneration hypothesis. On resting-state functional MRI scans, reduced functional network integrity in participants with MS had a strong positive correlation with clinical disability. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To assess the impact of a patient experience improvement program on national ranking in patient experience in a large academic radiology department. Materials and Methods This Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act\u2013compliant study was exempted from institutional review board approval. After initiating an electronic patient experience survey, 26 210 surveys and 22 213 comments were received from May 2017 to April 2018. During the study period, a multifaceted quality improvement initiative was instituted, focused on improving patient experience in the radiology department. The primary outcome was national percentile ranking as measured with the survey. Secondary outcome was the change in departmental percentile ranking compared with the overall hospital ranking for patient experience measured with a similar survey. Results The overall raw score for the department increased from 92.8 to 93.6 of 100 (P < .001), and the national ranking improved from the 35th to 50th percentile (P = .001). Improvements in raw scores related to personnel were primarily responsible for the increase in overall raw score and ranking. Of the 22 213 comments received, 3458 (15.6%) were negative. The percentage of negative comments was highly correlated with lower monthly percentile ranking (Pearson correlation coefficient of \u22120.69; P = .01). Conclusion It is feasible to develop a large-scale electronic survey to assess patient experience in the radiology department, to identify improvement opportunities, and to measurably improve patient experience. Changes in the percentage of negative comments were correlated with changes in a practice's national percentile rank in patient experience. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Purpose To assess the accuracy of staging positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in detecting distant metastasis in patients with local-regionally advanced cervical and high-risk endometrial cancer in the clinical trial by the American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) and the Gynecology Oncology Group (GOG) (ACRIN 6671/GOG 0233) and to compare central and institutional reader performance. Materials and Methods In this prospective multicenter trial, PET/CT and clinical data were reviewed for patients enrolled in ACRIN 6671/GOG 0233. Two central readers, blinded to site read and reference standard, reviewed PET/CT images for distant metastasis. Central review was then compared with institutional point-of-care interpretation. Reference standard was pathologic and imaging follow-up. Test performance for central and site reviews of PET/CT images was calculated and receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed. Generalized estimating equations and nonparametric bootstrap procedure for clustered data were used to assess statistical significance. Results There were 153 patients with cervical cancer and 203 patients with endometrial cancer enrolled at 28 sites. Overall prevalence of distant metastasis was 13.7% (21 of 153) for cervical cancer and 11.8% (24 of 203) for endometrial cancer. Central reader PET/CT interpretation demonstrated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value of 54.8%, 97.7%, 79.3%, and 93.1% for cervical cancer metastasis versus 64.6%, 98.6%, 86.1%, and 95.4% for endometrial cancer, respectively. By comparison, local institutional review demonstrated sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and negative predictive value of 47.6%, 93.9%, 55.6%, and 91.9% for cervical cancer metastasis and 66.7%, 93.9%, 59.3%, and 95.5% for endometrial cancer, respectively. For central readers, the specificity and PPV of PET/CT detection of cervical and endometrial cancer metastases were all significantly higher compared with that of local institutional review (P < .05). Central reader area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values were 0.78 and 0.89 for cervical and endometrial cancer, respectively; these were not significantly different from local institutional AUC values (0.75 and 0.84, respectively; P > .05 for both). Conclusion FDG PET/CT demonstrates high specificity and PPV for detecting distant metastasis in cervical and endometrial cancer and should be included in the staging evaluation. Blinded central review of imaging provides improved specificity and PPV for the detection of metastases and should be considered for future oncologic imaging clinical trials. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017",

        "Purpose The Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) Pediatric Bone Age Machine Learning Challenge was created to show an application of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging, promote collaboration to catalyze AI model creation, and identify innovators in medical imaging. Materials and Methods The goal of this challenge was to solicit individuals and teams to create an algorithm or model using ML techniques that would accurately determine skeletal age in a curated data set of pediatric hand radiographs. The primary evaluation measure was the mean absolute distance (MAD) in months, which was calculated as the mean of the absolute values of the difference between the model estimates and those of the reference standard, bone age. Results A data set consisting of 14 236 hand radiographs (12 611 training set, 1425 validation set, 200 test set) was made available to registered challenge participants. A total of 260 individuals or teams registered on the Challenge website. A total of 105 submissions were uploaded from 48 unique users during the training, validation, and test phases. Almost all methods used deep neural network techniques based on one or more convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The best five results based on MAD were 4.2, 4.4, 4.4, 4.5, and 4.5 months, respectively. Conclusion The RSNA Pediatric Bone Age Machine Learning Challenge showed how a coordinated approach to solving a medical imaging problem can be successfully conducted.

        "Background Mounting evidence suggests that the choroid plexus (CP) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer disease (AD), but its imaging profile in cognitive impairment remains unclear. Purpose To evaluate CP volume, permeability, and susceptibility by using MRI in patients at various stages of cognitive impairment. Materials and Methods This retrospective study evaluated patients with cognitive symptoms who underwent 3.0-T MRI of the brain, including dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), between January 2013 and May 2020. CP volume was automatically segmented using three-dimensional T1-weighted sequences; the volume transfer constant (ie, Ktrans) and fractional plasma volume (ie, Vp) were determined using DCE MRI, and susceptibility was assessed using QSM. The effects of CP volume, expressed as the ratio to intracranial volume, on cognition were evaluated using multivariable linear regression adjusted for age, sex, education, apolipoprotein E \u03b54 allele status, and volumetric measures. Results A total of 532 patients with cognitive symptoms (mean age, 72 years \u00b1 9 [SD]; 388 women) were included: 78 with subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), 158 with early mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 149 with late MCI, and 147 with AD. Among these, 132 patients underwent DCE MRI and QSM. CP volume was greater in patients at more severe stages (ratio of intracranial volume \u00d7 103: 0.9 \u00b1 0.3 for SCI, 1.0 \u00b1 0.3 for early MCI, 1.1 \u00b1 0.3 for late MCI, and 1.3 \u00b1 0.4 for AD; P < .001). Lower Ktrans (r = -0.19; P = .03) and Vp (r = -0.20; P = .02) were negatively associated with CP volume; susceptibility was not (r = 0.15; P = .10). CP volume was negatively associated with memory (B = -0.67; standard error of the mean [SEM], 0.21; P = .01), executive function (B = -0.90; SEM, 0.31; P = .01), and global cognition (B = -0.82; SEM, 0.32; P = .01). Conclusion Among patients with cognitive symptoms, larger choroid plexus volume was associated with severity of cognitive impairment in the Alzheimer disease spectrum.

        "Background Despite its high sensitivity in diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a screening population, the chest CT appearance of COVID-19 pneumonia is thought to be nonspecific. Purpose To assess the performance of radiologists in the United States and China in differentiating COVID-19 from viral pneumonia at chest CT. Materials and Methods In this study, 219 patients with positive COVID-19, as determined with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and abnormal chest CT findings, were retrospectively identified from seven Chinese hospitals in Hunan Province, China, from January 6 to February 20, 2020. Two hundred five patients with positive respiratory pathogen panel results for viral pneumonia and CT findings consistent with or highly suspicious for pneumonia, according to original radiologic interpretation within 7 days of each other, were identified from Rhode Island Hospital in Providence, RI. Three radiologists from China reviewed all chest CT scans (n = 424) blinded to RT-PCR findings to differentiate COVID-19 from viral pneumonia. A sample of 58 age-matched patients was randomly selected and evaluated by four radiologists from the United States in a similar fashion. Different CT features were recorded and compared between the two groups. Results For all chest CT scans (n = 424), the accuracy of the three radiologists from China in differentiating COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia was 83% (350 of 424), 80% (338 of 424), and 60% (255 of 424). In the randomly selected sample (n = 58), the sensitivities of three radiologists from China and four radiologists from the United States were 80%, 67%, 97%, 93%, 83%, 73%, and 70%, respectively. The corresponding specificities of the same readers were 100%, 93%, 7%, 100%, 93%, 93%, and 100%, respectively. Compared with non-COVID-19 pneumonia, COVID-19 pneumonia was more likely to have a peripheral distribution (80% vs 57%, P < .001), ground-glass opacity (91% vs 68%, P < .001), fine reticular opacity (56% vs 22%, P < .001), and vascular thickening (59% vs 22%, P < .001), but it was less likely to have a central and peripheral distribution (14% vs 35%, P < .001), pleural effusion (4% vs 39%, P < .001), or lymphadenopathy (3% vs 10%, P = .002). Conclusion Radiologists in China and in the United States distinguished coronavirus disease 2019 from viral pneumonia at chest CT with moderate to high accuracy. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

Patients who underwent subsequent curative liver transplantation were excluded to eliminate this confounding variable affecting survival. Radiologic response of time to progression and median overall survival were estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier method per the guidelines of the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and the World Health Organization (WHO). Results Seventy patients were treated with RS over 14 years. Sixty-three patients (90%) showed response by using EASL criteria, of which 41 (59%) showed complete response. Fifty patients (71%) achieved response by using WHO criteria, of which 11 (16%) achieved complete response. Response rates at 6 months were 86% and 49% by using EASL and WHO criteria, respectively. Median time to progression was 2.4 years (95% confidence interval: 2.1, 5.7), with 72% of patients having no target lesion progression at 5 years. Median overall survival was 6.7 years (95% confidence interval: 3.1, 6.7); survival probability at 1, 3, and 5 years was 98%, 66%, and 57%, respectively. Overall survival probability at 1, 3, and 5 years was 100%, 82%, and 75%, respectively, in patients with baseline tumor size less than or equal to 3 cm (n = 45) and was significantly longer than in patients with tumors greater than 3 cm (P = .026). Conclusion RS provides response rates, tumor control, and survival outcomes comparable to curative-intent treatments for selected patients with early-stage HCC who have preserved liver function. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "History A 1-year-old boy was referred for cochlear implant assessment after he received a diagnosis of bilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss at neonatal hearing screening shortly after birth. The child was born at term via uneventful delivery, and there was no history of familial hearing loss or maternal illness. Tympanic membranes were normal, and hearing loss was confirmed with auditory brainstem testing, which showed no response from either ear. Hearing aids were provided from 3 months of age, but no behavioral responses were noted when these were worn. He was also noted to have some mild developmental delay throughout his 1st year of life and was slow to crawl, roll over, and stand up. Physical examination showed no syndromic features or physical abnormalities. Ophthalmology confirmed normal vision and visual movements but bilateral anesthetic corneas. He had corneal abrasions due to minor repeated corneal trauma, and left-sided tarsorraphy was performed at 6 months. Facial nerve function, swallow, and voice quality were normal. To assess suitability for a cochlear implant, the patient underwent MRI of the temporal lobe and brain and thin-section CT of the temporal bones. The patient subsequently underwent left cochlear implantation.",
        "Compression-based ultrasonographic (US) elastography is associated with time-dependent mechanical and histologic changes of the healing tendon in a transected rabbit model of the Achilles tendon. This finding will lead to continued development of quantitative US, which can be used to objectively assess a diseased or healing tendon. With advances in the method used, clinical translation of tendon elastography may enable clinicians to diagnose tendon damage and track healing, which should improve both treatment and outcome.",
        "Background Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promising results for cancer detection with mammographic screening. However, evidence related to the use of AI in real screening settings remain sparse. Purpose To compare the performance of a commercially available AI system with routine, independent double reading with consensus as performed in a population-based screening program. Furthermore, the histopathologic characteristics of tumors with different AI scores were explored. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, 122 969 screening examinations from 47 877 women performed at four screening units in BreastScreen Norway from October 2009 to December 2018 were included. The data set included 752 screen-detected cancers (6.1 per 1000 examinations) and 205 interval cancers (1.7 per 1000 examinations). Each examination had an AI score between 1 and 10, where 1 indicated low risk of breast cancer and 10 indicated high risk. Threshold 1, threshold 2, and threshold 3 were used to assess the performance of the AI system as a binary decision tool (selected vs not selected). Threshold 1 was set at an AI score of 10, threshold 2 was set to yield a selection rate similar to the consensus rate (8.8%), and threshold 3 was set to yield a selection rate similar to an average individual radiologist (5.8%). Descriptive statistics were used to summarize screening outcomes. Results A total of 653 of 752 screen-detected cancers (86.8%) and 92 of 205 interval cancers (44.9%) were given a score of 10 by the AI system (threshold 1). Using threshold 3, 80.1% of the screen-detected cancers (602 of 752) and 30.7% of the interval cancers (63 of 205) were selected. Screen-detected cancer with AI scores not selected using the thresholds had favorable histopathologic characteristics compared to those selected; opposite results were observed for interval cancer. Conclusion The proportion of screen-detected cancers not selected by the artificial intelligence (AI) system at the three evaluated thresholds was less than 20%. The overall performance of the AI system was promising according to cancer detection. \u00a9 RSNA, 2022.",
        "Background Previous studies analyzed contrast agent spread during cervical interlaminar epidural steroid injections (CILESIs) by using planar fluoroscopy and reported wide variance of the rate of spread to the ventral epidural space (VES). Cross-sectional CT allows for direct viewing of contrast agent in the VES, providing improved spread assessment and thereby informing needle placement decisions when targeting pain generators. Purpose To determine the extent of injectate spread at CT fluoroscopy-guided CILESI, with particular attention to the VES and bilateral neuroforamina, by using cross-sectional CT. Materials and Methods This study reviewed 83 consecutive CT fluoroscopy-guided CILESIs at which a postprocedural cervical spine CT was performed (June 2016 to December 2017). All procedures used the same injectate (2 mL corticosteroid, 3 mL contrast agent). Postprocedural CT scans were reviewed for the presence of contrast within the VES, dorsal epidural space, ipsilateral neuroforamen, and contralateral neuroforamen in every cervical interlaminar level. Descriptive data are presented as frequencies or means. McNemar tests or hierarchical logistic models were used to assess associations between covariates and contrast agent spread to particular locations. Results The study cohort included 73 individual patients (59% women; 43 of 73) (mean patient age, 57.6 years \u00b1 11.5 [standard deviation]). Mean number of levels of cranial spread were 0.6 level for VES, 1.9 levels for contralateral neuroforamen, 2.1 levels for ipsilateral neuroforamen, and 3 levels for dorsal epidural space. No VES spread in any level was found with 35% (29 of 83) of injections. VES spread was more likely to occur in the level of needle placement (43%; 36 of 83) than in other interlaminar levels (19.5%; 97 of 498;",
        "Purpose To investigate whether radiomic features at MRI improve survival prediction in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) when they are integrated with clinical and genetic profiles. Materials and Methods Data in patients with a diagnosis of GBM between December 2009 and January 2017 (217 patients) were retrospectively reviewed up to May 2017 and allocated to training and test sets (3:1 ratio). Radiomic features (n = 796) were extracted from multiparametric MRI. A random survival forest (RSF) model was trained with the radiomic features along with clinical and genetic profiles (O-6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase promoter methylation and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutation statuses) to predict overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). The RSF models were validated on the test set. The incremental values of radiomic features were evaluated by using the integrated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (iAUC). Results The 217 patients had a mean age of 57.9 years, and there were 87 female patients (age range, 22-81 years) and 130 male patients (age range, 17-85 years). The median OS and PFS of patients were 352 days (range, 20-1809 days) and 264 days (range, 21-1809 days), respectively. The RSF radiomics models were successfully validated on the test set (iAUC, 0.652 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.524, 0.769] and 0.590 [95% CI: 0.502, 0.689] for OS and PFS, respectively). The addition of a radiomics model to clinical and genetic profiles improved survival prediction when compared with models containing clinical and genetic profiles alone (P = .04 and .03 for OS and PFS, respectively). Conclusion Radiomic MRI phenotyping can improve survival prediction when integrated with clinical and genetic profiles and thus has potential as a practical imaging biomarker. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Background Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a global social and public health problem, but published literature regarding the exacerbation of physical IPV during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is lacking. Purpose To assess the incidence, patterns, and severity of injuries in IPV victims during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 compared with the prior 3 years. Materials and Methods The demographics, clinical presentation, injuries, and radiologic findings of patients reporting physical abuse arising from IPV during the statewide COVID-19 pandemic between March 11 and May 3, 2020, were compared with data from the same period for the past 3 years. Pearson \u03c72 and Fisher exact tests were used for analysis. Results A total of 26 victims of physical IPV from 2020 (mean age, 37 years \u00b1 13 [standard deviation]; 25 women) were evaluated and compared with 42 victims of physical IPV (mean age, 41 years \u00b1 15; 40 women) from 2017 to 2019. Although the overall number of patients who reported IPV decreased during the pandemic, the incidence of physical IPV was 1.8 times greater (95% CI: 1.1, 3.0; P = .01). The total number of deep injuries was 28 during 2020 versus 16 from 2017 to 2019; the number of deep injuries per victim was 1.1 during 2020 compared with 0.4 from 2017 to 2019 (P < .001). The incidence of high-risk abuse defined by mechanism was two times greater in 2020 (95% CI: 1.2, 4.7; P = .01). Patients who experienced IPV during the COVID-19 pandemic were more likely to be White; 17 (65%) victims in 2020 were White compared with 11 (26%) in the prior years (P = .007). Conclusion There was a higher incidence and severity of physical intimate partner violence (IPV) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic compared with the prior 3 years. These results suggest that victims of IPV delayed reaching out to health care services until the late stages of the abuse cycle during the COVID-19 pandemic. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020",
        "History A 36-year-old left-handed woman with a history of developmental delay and medical refractory seizures since birth most recently presented with continuous simple partial seizures and occasional breakthrough complex partial seizures with postictal migraines. These were described as the patient \u201cbecoming pale with sinking to the floor and staring for approximately 1 minute with confusion thereafter.\u201d The patient had years of reported seizure freedom until 2010 when she was evaluated for intractable headaches, and electroencephalography revealed her focal subclinical status. At that time, ambulatory electroencephalography findings showed asymmetric left parietal-occipital high-amplitude spike-and-wave discharges in her best awake and alert state. Since that time, the patient developed and continues to have complex partial seizures every 2\u20133 months that are persistent despite the implementation of several medical regimens. At the time of recent presentation, the patient initially underwent unenhanced head CT in the emergency department followed by unenhanced MRI of the brain due to increased seizure activity at the patient\u2019s group home despite continued compliance with her antiepileptic regimen. Contrast material\u2013enhanced imaging was not available at the time of recent presentation, so comparison was made with gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI performed approximately 9 years earlier (Figs 1\u20135).",
        "Intravenous iodinated contrast media are commonly used with CT to evaluate disease and to determine treatment response. The risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) developing in patients with reduced kidney function following exposure to intravenous iodinated contrast media has been overstated. This is due primarily to historic lack of control groups sufficient to separate contrast-induced AKI (CI-AKI; ie, AKI caused by contrast media administration) from contrast-associated AKI (CA-AKI; ie, AKI coincident to contrast media administration). Although the true risk of CI-AKI remains uncertain for patients with severe kidney disease, prophylaxis with intravenous normal saline is indicated for patients who have AKI or an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 who are not undergoing maintenance dialysis. In individual high-risk circumstances, prophylaxis may be considered in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30\u201344 mL/min/1.73 m2 at the discretion of the ordering clinician.

        "These recommendations for measuring pulmonary nodules at computed tomography (CT) are a statement from the Fleischner Society and, as such, incorporate the opinions of a multidisciplinary international group of thoracic radiologists, pulmonologists, surgeons, pathologists, and other specialists. The recommendations address nodule size measurements at CT, which is a topic of importance, given that all available guidelines for nodule management are essentially based on nodule size or changes thereof. The recommendations are organized according to practical questions that commonly arise when nodules are measured in routine clinical practice and are, together with their answers, summarized in a table. The recommendations include technical requirements for accurate nodule measurement, directions on how to accurately measure the size of nodules at the workstation, and directions on how to report nodule size and changes in size. The recommendations are designed to provide practical advice based on the available evidence from the literature; however, areas of uncertainty are also discussed, and topics needing future research are highlighted. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Background Portable, low-field-strength (0.064-T) MRI has the potential to transform neuroimaging but is limited by low spatial resolution and low signal-to-noise ratio. Purpose To implement a machine learning super-resolution algorithm that synthesizes higher spatial resolution images (1-mm isotropic) from lower resolution T1-weighted and T2-weighted portable brain MRI scans, making them amenable to automated quantitative morphometry. Materials and Methods An external high-field-strength MRI data set (1-mm isotropic scans from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies data set) and segmentations for 39 regions of interest (ROIs) in the brain were used to train a super-resolution convolutional neural network (CNN). Secondary analysis of an internal test set of 24 paired low- and high-field-strength clinical MRI scans in participants with neurologic symptoms was performed. These were part of a prospective observational study (August 2020 to December 2021) at Massachusetts General Hospital (exclusion criteria: inability to lay flat, body habitus preventing low-field-strength MRI, presence of MRI contraindications). Three well-established automated segmentation tools were applied to three sets of scans: high-field-strength (1.5\u20133 T, reference standard), low-field-strength (0.064 T), and synthetic high-field-strength images generated from the low-field-strength data with the CNN. Statistical significance of correlations was assessed with Student t tests. Correlation coefficients were compared with Steiger Z tests. Results Eleven participants (mean age, 50 years \u00b1 14; seven men) had full cerebrum coverage in the images without motion artifacts or large stroke lesion with distortion from mass effect. Direct segmentation of low-field-strength MRI yielded nonsignificant correlations with volumetric measurements from high field strength for most ROIs (P > .05). Correlations largely improved when segmenting the synthetic images: P values were less than .05 for all ROIs (eg, for the hippocampus [r = 0.85; P < .001], thalamus [r = 0.84; P = .001], and whole cerebrum [r = 0.92; P < .001]). Deviations from the model (z score maps) visually correlated with pathologic abnormalities. Conclusion This work demonstrated proof-of-principle augmentation of portable MRI with a machine learning super-resolution algorithm, which yielded highly correlated brain morphometric measurements to real higher resolution images. \u00a9 RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Background The relationship between method of breast cancer screening (mammography or US) and survival outcome in patients with screening-detected ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) has not been determined. Purpose To investigate whether different methods of breast cancer screening are associated with different survival outcomes in patients with screening-detected DCIS and to evaluate clinical-pathologic and imaging factors associated with second breast cancer. Materials and Methods We retrospectively identified women who underwent surgery to treat DCIS initially detected with screening mammography or US between July 2004 and December 2011 in a single institution. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were assessed. Factors associated with second breast cancer (invasive carcinoma or DCIS) were found with multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Subgroups were analyzed according to screening method. Results A total of 814 women (median age, 47 years; age range, 25-81 years) were included; 627 underwent treatment for screening mammography-detected DCIS (mammography-detected group), and 187 underwent treatment for screening US-detected DCIS (US-detected group). During follow-up (median, 7 years; interquartile range, 5-8 years), 26 ipsilateral and 26 contralateral second breast cancers (6.4%, 52 of 814) were found, with 44 in the mammography-detected group and eight in the US-detected group. The overall 5-year OS and DFS rates were 100% and 95.3%, respectively. DFS rates did not differ according to screening method (P = .21, 5-year DFS rates were 94.9% in the mammography-detected group and 96.5% in the US-detected group). In the mammography-detected group, higher nuclear grade (intermediate grade: hazard ratio [HR], 5.7; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3, 24.3; P = 0.02) (high grade: HR, 8.0; 95% CI: 1.9, 34.2; P = .01) and dense breast (HR, 3.5; 95% CI: 1.1, 11.4; P = 0.04) were associated with second breast cancer. In the US-detected group, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positivity was associated with second breast cancer (HR, 9.2; 95% CI: 2.2, 38.5; P = .002). Conclusion Disease-free survival of patients who underwent treatment for screening-detected ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) did not differ according to screening detection method. In patients with screening mammography-detected DCIS, higher nuclear grade and dense breast were associated with second breast cancer, and in patients with screening US-detected DCIS, human epidermal growth factor 2 positivity was associated with second breast cancer. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "A 61-year-old woman was admitted to our institution to characterize an incidentally found mass in the porta hepatis. An episode of pulmonary embolism (18 months ago) and a pulmonary abscess (15 months ago) were reported. The patient had no history of known liver disease, previous cancer diagnosis, or trauma. She underwent total thyroidectomy for goiter several years ago, with initial iatrogenic hypothyroidism treated with levo-thyroxine hormone replacement therapy. During follow-up, this therapy was adjusted (50 \u03bcg per day) to induce euthyroidism and to achieve a target serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration of 1-2 mIU/L. Physical examination findings were unremarkable. Admission laboratory data were entirely normal, including tumor markers, such as carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9. Unenhanced and multiphasic contrast-enhanced CT imaging was performed in arterial, portal venous, and delayed (3 minutes after injection) phases. Axial and coronal maximum intensity projection reconstructed CT images were obtained in the arterial and portal venous phases. Because of the imaging findings of the mass in the porta hepatis and concerns about malignancy, the patient underwent endoscopy. Therefore, endoscopic US-guided fine-needle biopsy was performed in the same session. The patient also underwent whole-body iodine 131 (131I) scintigraphy.",
        "Purpose To analyze how automatic segmentation translates in accuracy and precision to morphology and relaxometry compared with manual segmentation and increases the speed and accuracy of the work flow that uses quantitative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to study knee degenerative diseases such as osteoarthritis (OA). Materials and Methods This retrospective study involved the analysis of 638 MR imaging volumes from two data cohorts acquired at 3.0 T: (a) spoiled gradient-recalled acquisition in the steady state T1\u03c1-weighted images and (b) three-dimensional (3D) double-echo steady-state (DESS) images. A deep learning model based on the U-Net convolutional network architecture was developed to perform automatic segmentation. Cartilage and meniscus compartments were manually segmented by skilled technicians and radiologists for comparison. Performance of the automatic segmentation was evaluated on Dice coefficient overlap with the manual segmentation, as well as by the automatic segmentations' ability to quantify, in a longitudinally repeatable way, relaxometry and morphology. Results The models produced strong Dice coefficients, particularly for 3D-DESS images, ranging between 0.770 and 0.878 in the cartilage compartments to 0.809 and 0.753 for the lateral meniscus and medial meniscus, respectively. The models averaged 5 seconds to generate the automatic segmentations. Average correlations between manual and automatic quantification of T1\u03c1 and T2 values were 0.8233 and 0.8603, respectively, and 0.9349 and 0.9384 for volume and thickness, respectively. Longitudinal precision of the automatic method was comparable with that of the manual one. Conclusion U-Net demonstrates efficacy and precision in quickly generating accurate segmentations that can be used to extract relaxation times and morphologic characterization and values that can be used in the monitoring and diagnosis of OA. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To determine if patient survival and mechanisms of right ventricular failure in pulmonary hypertension could be predicted by using supervised machine learning of three-dimensional patterns of systolic cardiac motion. Materials and Methods The study was approved by a research ethics committee, and participants gave written informed consent. Two hundred fifty-six patients (143 women; mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 63 years \u00b1 17) with newly diagnosed pulmonary hypertension underwent cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, right-sided heart catheterization, and 6-minute walk testing with a median follow-up of 4.0 years. Semiautomated segmentation of short-axis cine images was used to create a three-dimensional model of right ventricular motion. Supervised principal components analysis was used to identify patterns of systolic motion that were most strongly predictive of survival. Survival prediction was assessed by using difference in median survival time and area under the curve with time-dependent receiver operating characteristic analysis for 1-year survival. Results At the end of follow-up, 36% of patients (93 of 256) died, and one underwent lung transplantation. Poor outcome was predicted by a loss of effective contraction in the septum and free wall, coupled with reduced basal longitudinal motion. When added to conventional imaging and hemodynamic, functional, and clinical markers, three-dimensional cardiac motion improved survival prediction (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.73 vs 0.60, respectively; P < .001) and provided greater differentiation according to difference in median survival time between high- and low-risk groups (13.8 vs 10.7 years, respectively; P < .001). Conclusion A machine-learning survival model that uses three-dimensional cardiac motion predicts outcome independent of conventional risk factors in patients with newly diagnosed pulmonary hypertension.

        "Background Missed fractures are a common cause of diagnostic discrepancy between initial radiographic interpretation and the final read by board-certified radiologists. Purpose To assess the effect of assistance by artificial intelligence (AI) on diagnostic performances of physicians for fractures on radiographs. Materials and Methods This retrospective diagnostic study used the multi-reader, multi-case methodology based on an external multicenter data set of 480 examinations with at least 60 examinations per body region (foot and ankle, knee and leg, hip and pelvis, hand and wrist, elbow and arm, shoulder and clavicle, rib cage, and thoracolumbar spine) between July 2020 and January 2021. Fracture prevalence was set at 50%. The ground truth was determined by two musculoskeletal radiologists, with discrepancies solved by a third. Twenty-four readers (radiologists, orthopedists, emergency physicians, physician assistants, rheumatologists, family physicians) were presented the whole validation data set (n = 480), with and without AI assistance, with a 1-month minimum washout period. The primary analysis had to demonstrate superiority of sensitivity per patient and the noninferiority of specificity per patient at -3% margin with AI aid. Stand-alone AI performance was also assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves. Results A total of 480 patients were included (mean age, 59 years \u00b1 16 [standard deviation]; 327 women). The sensitivity per patient was 10.4% higher (95% CI: 6.9, 13.9; P < .001 for superiority) with AI aid (4331 of 5760 readings, 75.2%) than without AI (3732 of 5760 readings, 64.8%). The specificity per patient with AI aid (5504 of 5760 readings, 95.6%) was noninferior to that without AI aid (5217 of 5760 readings, 90.6%), with a difference of +5.0% (95% CI: +2.0, +8.0; P = .001 for noninferiority). AI shortened the average reading time by 6.3 seconds per examination (95% CI: -12.5, -0.1; P = .046). The sensitivity by patient gain was significant in all regions (+8.0% to +16.2%; P < .05) but shoulder and clavicle and spine (+4.2% and +2.6%; P = .12 and .52). Conclusion AI assistance improved the sensitivity and may even improve the specificity of fracture detection by radiologists and nonradiologists, without lengthening reading time.

        "Purpose To develop a deep learning\u2013based method for fully automated quantification of left ventricular (LV) function from short-axis cine MR images and to evaluate its performance in a multivendor and multicenter setting. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included cine MRI data sets obtained from three major MRI vendors in four medical centers from 2008 to 2016. Three convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with the U-NET architecture were trained on data sets of increasing variability: (a) a single-vendor, single-center, homogeneous cohort of 100 patients (CNN1); (b) a single-vendor, multicenter, heterogeneous cohort of 200 patients (CNN2); and (c) a multivendor, multicenter, heterogeneous cohort of 400 patients (CNN3). All CNNs were tested on an independent multivendor, multicenter data set of 196 patients. CNN performance was evaluated with respect to the manual annotations from three experienced observers in terms of (a) LV detection accuracy, (b) LV segmentation accuracy, and (c) LV functional parameter accuracy. Automatic and manual results were compared with the paired Wilcoxon test, Pearson correlation, and Bland-Altman analysis. Results CNN3 achieved the highest performance on the independent testing data set. The average perpendicular distance compared with manual analysis was 1.1 mm \u00b1 0.3 for CNN3, compared with 1.5 mm \u00b1 1.0 for CNN1 (P < .05) and 1.3 mm \u00b1 0.6 for CNN2 (P < .05). The LV function parameters derived from CNN3 showed a high correlation (r2 \u2265 0.98) and agreement with those obtained by experts for data sets from different vendors and centers. Conclusion A deep learning\u2013based method trained on a data set with high variability can achieve fully automated and accurate cine MRI analysis on multivendor, multicenter cine MRI data. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 See also the editorial by Colletti in this issue.",
        "History A 29-year-old woman presented with a 6-month history of progressive general fatigue, fluctuating limb weakness, and difficulty climbing stairs. She initially experienced occasional episodes of transient diplopia that developed while reading in the evening. She subsequently started to experience dry eyes and mouth, difficulty chewing, and mild dysphagia that worsened throughout the day. Her medical history included hypothyroidism from Hashimoto thyroiditis and pneumonia with left pleural effusion. She had no smoking history, and her body mass index was normal (23.8 kg/m2). No medication use was reported at admission. Physical examination revealed mild bilateral ptosis, reduced muscle tone and strength that worsened in proximal leg muscles, and decreased deep tendon reflexes. An edrophonium test revealed improvement in muscle strength and eyelid ptosis. Repetitive nerve stimulation revealed low amplitude of compound muscle action potential at rest (0.21 mV), with a marked increase (700%; normal increase, <60%) at high-rate stimulation (50 Hz). Laboratory work-up was unremarkable except for detection of acetylcholine receptor antibodies in the serum (21.30 nmol/L) and P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel antibodies (220 pmol/L). Recent MRI of the brain and spine at an outside hospital showed no abnormal findings.

        "Background Despite advances, blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) cardiac MRI for myocardial perfusion is limited by inadequate spatial coverage, imaging speed, multiple breath holds, and imaging artifacts, particularly at 3.0 T. Purpose To develop and validate a robust, contrast agent-unenhanced, free-breathing three-dimensional (3D) cardiac MRI approach for reliably examining changes in myocardial perfusion between rest and adenosine stress. Materials and Methods A heart rate-independent, free-breathing 3D T2 mapping technique at 3.0 T that can be completed within the period of adenosine stress (\u22644 minutes) was developed by using computer simulations, ex vivo heart preparations, and dogs. Studies in dogs were performed with and without coronary stenosis and validated with simultaneously acquired nitrogen 13 (",
        "History A 6-year-old male child, born at full term via vaginal delivery, presented with a history of ataxia and delayed motor development. There was no family history of neurodegenerative disease.

        "HistoryA 20-year old woman living in Turkey presented with a 3-month history of lower back pain. She had no medical history of note and was taking no medications. Complete blood count, C-reactive protein level, sedimentation rate, and creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase levels were within normal limits. Anteroposterior pelvic radiography and unenhanced pelvic CT were performed to rule out sacroiliitis. The imaging findings were abnormal, and the patient underwent contrast-enhanced sacroiliac MRI. A few days later, she underwent contrast-enhanced (100 mL iohexol, Omnipaque; GE Healthcare, Cork, Ireland) abdominal CT because of right upper quadrant pain.",
        "History A 54-year-old white woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis who was taking glucocorticoids and methotrexate presented to the emergency department in December with worsening shortness of breath and chest heaviness for 1 week. She reported additional symptoms of weakness, headache, and arthralgia primarily involving her bilateral hands, wrist, ankles, and feet. She denied experiencing fevers, syncope or presyncope, focal neurologic deficits, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, unintentional weight loss, or recent trauma. Additional medical history included hypertension, asthma, degenerative disk disease, and migraine, all of which were reportedly controlled with medications. This patient had a smoking history of 80 pack-years, but she had quit smoking 2 months prior to presentation. She denied abuse of alcohol or recreational drugs and reported she was up-to-date on her immunizations, including those for pneumonia and flu. Family history was pertinent for breast cancer in her mother, sister, and maternal aunt. The patient reported normal findings at screening mammography and colonoscopy. A physical examination was remarkable for slightly asymmetric breath sounds, which appeared to be diminished on the right side. This patient had multiple joint deformities, most notably in the bilateral metacarpophalangeal joints. Initial electrocardiography findings and cardiac biomarkers were negative. Her complete blood count and basic metabolic profile were unremarkable. Posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs were obtained in the emergency department. Subsequently, computed tomography (CT) of the chest was performed.",
        "History A 44-year-old woman who was a resident of Bihar, which is a state in eastern India, presented to the surgical outpatient department of our hospital with a history of gradually increasing swelling of the right breast associated with redness, pain, and itching over the past month (Fig 1). She reported a general sense of malaise and experienced episodes of chills over the past 6 months; however, she had no documented fever. There was no history of breast trauma. No history suggestive of a possible hypercoagulable state could be elicited (she was a nonsmoker, had undergone uncomplicated normal vaginal delivery 15 years earlier, was not taking oral contraceptives, and had no history to suggest past deep venous thrombosis). General physical examination findings were unremarkable. On local examination, she was found to have diffuse enlargement of the right breast. The skin over the lateral part of the breast was erythematous and showed the presence of prominent superficial veins. On palpation, few ill-defined firm mobile masses were found in the upper outer quadrant with overlying skin induration. No skin ulceration or nipple discharge was present. Few firm and discrete lymph nodes were palpable in the right axilla. Laboratory investigations showed mild anemia (hemoglobin level, 10 g/dL; normal range, 12-15 g/dL), a total leukocyte count of 14 000 cells per microliter (14 cells \u00d7 109/L) (normal range, 4500-11 000 cells per microliter [4.5-11 cells \u00d7 109/L]), a normal differential leukocyte count (74% neutrophils [normal range, 40%-80%], 24% lymphocytes [normal range, 20%-40%], and 2% eosinophils [normal range, 1%-4%]), and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 31 mm per hour (normal range, 0-29 mm per hour). She underwent both mammography (Fig 2) and US (Fig 3). Real-time US showed mobile structures on the series of US images obtained seconds apart (Fig 4). On the basis of the imaging findings, US-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology was performed to confirm the diagnosis, and appropriate treatment was instituted.",
        "Purpose To develop a computed tomographic (CT) angiographic postprocessing protocol with two- and three-dimensional measurements for follow-up of patients who underwent endovascular aortic repair. Materials and Methods This HIPAA-compliant institutional review board-approved retrospective study included 159 patients (129 men, 30 women; mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 74.9 years \u00b1 8.2) who underwent 824 CT examinations (median of five examinations per patient; range, two to 14) with unenhanced and arterial -phase imaging performed between September 2004 and March 2015. The largest diameter on the axial plane; coronal, sagittal, and maximal diameter perpendicular to the reconstructed centerline; volume of the abdominal aortic aneurysm sac; and volume from the lowest renal artery to the aortic bifurcation and to the common iliac artery bifurcation were measured. Endoleaks on contrast material-enhanced images were considered the reference standard, and the predictive value of diameter and volume changes was analyzed. Intraclass correlation was used to compare diameters and volumes. Results All diameters and volumes showed excellent correlation (intraclass coefficient, 0.95 and 0.94, respectively). Average interobserver difference for diameters and volumes was 2%-3% and 4%-12%, respectively. Endoleaks were observed in 80 (50%) of 159 patients (59 [74%] at initial and 21 [26%] at later CT angiography). New endo-leaks were associated with increased aneurysm size measured as the largest diameter on the axial plane (P = .04) and perpendicular to the centerline (P = .01), and volume was measured from the lowest renal artery to the aortic bifurcation (P = .03) and to the common iliac artery bifurcation (P = .01). With a 5% size threshold, sensitivity and specificity for detection of endoleaks was optimal for centerline diameter (64.3% and 81.7%, respectively) and volume from the lowest renal artery to the common iliac artery bifurcation (57.1% and 63.5%). Conclusion The maximal diameter and volume of an abdominal aortic aneurysm sac can be used for temporal monitoring after endovascular aortic repair, with excellent correlation and interobserver agreement. An increase in the centerline diameter and volume from the lowest renal artery to the iliac bifurcation were the most sensitive criteria for detecting endoleaks. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Background An iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithm was introduced for clinical photon-counting detector (PCD) CT. Purpose To investigate the image quality and the optimal strength level of a quantum IR algorithm (QIR; Siemens Healthcare) for virtual monoenergetic images and polychromatic images (T3D) in a phantom and in patients undergoing portal venous abdominal PCD CT. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, noise power spectrum (NPS) was measured in a water-filled phantom. Consecutive oncologic patients who underwent portal venous abdominal PCD CT between March and April 2021 were included. Virtual monoenergetic images at 60 keV and T3D were reconstructed without QIR (QIR-off; reference standard) and with QIR at four levels (QIR 1\u20134; index tests). Global noise index, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and voxel-wise CT attenuation differences were measured. Noise and texture, artifacts, diagnostic confidence, and overall quality were assessed qualitatively. Conspicuity of hypodense liver lesions was rated by four readers. Parametric (analyses of variance, paired t tests) and nonparametric tests (Friedman, post hoc Wilcoxon signed-rank tests) were used to compare quantitative and qualitative image quality among reconstructions. Results In the phantom, NPS showed unchanged noise texture across reconstructions with maximum spatial frequency differences of 0.01 per millimeter. Fifty patients (mean age, 59 years \u00b1 16 [standard deviation]; 31 women) were included. Global noise index was reduced from QIR-off to QIR-4 by 45% for 60 keV and by 44% for T3D (both, P < .001). CNR of the liver improved from QIR-off to QIR-4 by 74% for 60 keV and by 69% for T3D (both, P < .001). No evidence of difference was found in mean attenuation of fat and liver (P = .79\u2013.84) and on a voxel-wise basis among reconstructions. Qualitatively, QIR-4 outperformed all reconstructions in every category for 60 keV and T3D (P value range, <.001 to .01). All four readers rated QIR-4 superior to other strengths for lesion conspicuity (P value range, <.001 to .04). Conclusion In portal venous abdominal photon-counting detector CT, an iterative reconstruction algorithm (QIR; Siemens Healthcare) at high strength levels improved image quality by reducing noise and improving contrast-to-noise ratio and lesion conspicuity without compromising image texture or CT attenuation values. \u00a9 RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "History A 24-year-old right-handed woman presented to a neuro-ophthalmology clinic in Massachusetts in the summer with acute binocular diplopia when looking down and to the left, which started about 1 month earlier. Her medical history was notable for Raynaud syndrome, recurrent streptococcal pharyngitis, and an allergy to amoxicillin. Three days prior to developing diplopia, she presented to an outside emergency department due to fever, chills, and back pain. She received ciprofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection based on urinalysis, which demonstrated few bacteria and was negative for leukocyte esterase, nitrites, and white blood cells. She then presented again to an outside emergency department for diplopia evaluation. Initial MRI and MR angiography of the brain at that time did not demonstrate any relevant findings, and the patient was referred to our department for neuro-ophthalmic evaluation, where she was seen 4 weeks later. Neuro-ophthalmic examination revealed 20/20 visual acuity in both eyes, and a right hypertropia in left gaze, downgaze and right head tilt, with right eye excyclotorsion. There were no ocular signs of myasthenia gravis or thyroid eye disease, nor did the patient report ocular or systemic symptoms. She denied recent travel. High-spatial-resolution MRI of the brain and orbit were performed (Figs 1, 2).",
        "History A 37-year-old man from the United States presented with a 1-year history of neck pain and stiffness that had been unsuccessfully treated with manipulative therapy by a chiropractor at another institution. Past medical history was remarkable only for marijuana and air duster abuse. He denied use of any prescription medications. Physical examination was notable for markedly reduced range of motion of the cervical spine. Laboratory work-up revealed an elevated alkaline phosphatase level (302 U/L [5.0 \u03bckat/L]; normal range, 40\u2013100 U/L [0.7\u20131.67 \u03bckat/L]), but all other laboratory findings, including complete blood count, renal function, liver function, vitamin A level, serum protein electrophoresis, and hepatitis C antibodies were within normal limits. Cervical spine radiography was performed (Fig 1), followed by MRI (Fig 2). Subsequently, a full skeletal survey was ordered.

        "BackgroundDeep learning has the potential to augment the use of chest radiography in clinical radiology, but challenges include poor generalizability, spectrum bias, and difficulty comparing across studies.PurposeTo develop and evaluate deep learning models for chest radiograph interpretation by using radiologist-adjudicated reference standards.Materials and MethodsDeep learning models were developed to detect four findings (pneumothorax, opacity, nodule or mass, and fracture) on frontal chest radiographs. This retrospective study used two data sets. Data set 1 (DS1) consisted of 759 611 images from a multicity hospital network and ChestX-ray14 is a publicly available data set with 112 120 images. Natural language processing and expert review of a subset of images provided labels for 657 954 training images. Test sets consisted of 1818 and 1962 images from DS1 and ChestX-ray14, respectively. Reference standards were defined by radiologist-adjudicated image review. Performance was evaluated by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value. Four radiologists reviewed test set images for performance comparison. Inverse probability weighting was applied to DS1 to account for positive radiograph enrichment and estimate population-level performance.ResultsIn DS1, population-adjusted areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for pneumothorax, nodule or mass, airspace opacity, and fracture were, respectively, 0.95 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.91, 0.99), 0.72 (95% CI: 0.66, 0.77), 0.91 (95% CI: 0.88, 0.93), and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.79, 0.92). With ChestX-ray14, areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.94 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.96), 0.91 (95% CI: 0.89, 0.93), 0.94 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.95), and 0.81 (95% CI: 0.75, 0.86), respectively.ConclusionExpert-level models for detecting clinically relevant chest radiograph findings were developed for this study by using adjudicated reference standards and with population-level performance estimation.

        "Background Increased cerebral signal intensity (SI) has been reported in patients undergoing MRI with gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs). Published data on gadobenate dimeglumine have been somewhat contradictory. Purpose To evaluate the relationship between dosage of gadobenate dimeglumine and SI change at MRI following multiple gadobenate dimeglumine administrations. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, patients referred for clinically indicated brain MRI from January 2006 through May 2016 were evaluated for inclusion. Eligible patients were between 18 and 90 years old at their baseline brain MRI and had never received a GBCA, had undergone three or more MRI examinations with gadobenate dimeglumine, and had the baseline scan and another brain MRI scan available for comparison. The primary group consisted of patients with four or fewer supratentorial lesions smaller than 3 cm who underwent axial T1-weighted MRI at 1.5 T. One patient had also undergone prior radiation therapy. The secondary group consisted of patients with a history of brain radiation therapy or craniotomy who underwent 1.5-T and 3-T same-plane T1-weighted MRI (in any order). The SI for up to eight brain MRI examinations per patient was measured, and relative SI changes from baseline to interval scans were calculated. A subgroup analysis was performed to assess the gadobenate dimeglumine washout since the last gadolinium exposure. All patients had normal renal and liver functions. Linear mixed regression analyses were performed for variables with P < .05. Results In 43 patients (14 men, 29 women; median age, 49 years; age range, 25\u201373 years), the dentate nucleus (DN)\u2013to\u2013middle cerebral peduncle (MCP) SI ratio showed a mean increase of 6.7% \u00b1 3.9 in the primary group and 4.0% \u00b1 2.7 in the secondary group (both P < .001) following the administration of 134 mL \u00b1 141 gadobenate dimeglumine over 55 months \u00b1 35.2.

        "Background Preoperative assessment of pathologic complete response (pCR) in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) is increasingly needed for organ preservation, but large-scale validation of an MRI radiomics model remains lacking. Purpose To evaluate radiomics models based on T2-weighted imaging and diffusion-weighted MRI for predicting pCR after nCRT in LARC and compare their performance with visual assessment by radiologists. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included patients with LARC (clinical stage T3 or higher, positive nodal status, or both) who underwent post-nCRT MRI and elective resection between January 2009 and December 2018. Surgical histopathologic analysis was the reference standard for pCR. Radiomic features were extracted from the volume of interest on T2-weighted images and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps from post-nCRT MRI to generate three models: T2 weighted, ADC, and both T2 weighted and ADC (merged). Radiomics signatures were generated using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator with tenfold cross-validation. Three experienced radiologists independently rated tumor regression grades at MRI and compared these with the radiomics models' diagnostic outcomes. Areas under the curve (AUCs) of the radiomics models and pooled readers were compared by using the DeLong method. Results Among 898 patients, 189 (21%) achieved pCR. The patients were chronologically divided into training (n = 592; mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 59 years \u00b1 12; 388 men) and test (n = 306; mean age, 59 years \u00b1 12; 190 men) sets. The radiomics signatures of the T2-weighted, ADC, and merged models demonstrated AUCs of 0.82, 0.79, and 0.82, respectively, with no evidence of a difference found between the T2-weighted and merged models (P = .49), while the ADC model performed worse than the merged model (P = .02). The T2-weighted model had higher classification performance (AUC, 0.82 vs 0.74 [P = .009]) and sensitivity (80.0% vs 15.6% [P < .001]), but lower specificity (68.4% vs 98.6% [P < .001]) than the pooled performance of the three radiologists. Conclusion An MRI-based radiomics model showed better classification performance than experienced radiologists for diagnosing pathologic complete response in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. \u00a9 RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Background Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is replacing digital mammography (DM) in the clinical workflow. Currently, there are limited prospective studies comparing the diagnostic accuracy of both examinations and the role of synthetic mammography (SM) and computer-aided detection (CAD). Purpose To compare the accuracy of DM versus DM + DBT in population-based breast cancer screening. Materials and Methods This prospective study, performed from November 2010 to December 2012, included 24 301 women (mean age, 59.1 years \u00b1 5.7 [standard deviation]) with 281 cancers, of which 51 were interval cancers. Each examination was independently interpreted with four reading modes: DM, DM + CAD, DM + DBT, and SM + DBT. Sensitivity and specificity were compared for DM versus DM + DBT, DM versus DM + CAD, DM + DBT versus SM + DBT, and DM versus DM + DBT at double reading. Reader-adjusted performance characteristics of reading modes were evaluated on the basis of pre-arbitration (initial interpretation) scores. Statistical analysis was based on cluster bootstrap analysis using 10 000 random resamples. Results Sensitivity was 54.1% (152 of 281) for DM and 70.5% (198 of 281) for DM + DBT. Reader-adjusted difference was 12.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.2%, 19.7%; P = .001). Specificity was 94.2% (false-positive fraction [FPF], 5.8%; 1388 of 24 020) for DM and 95.0% (FPF, 5.0%; 1209/24 020) for DM + DBT, with a reader-adjusted difference in FPF of -1.2% (95% CI: -1.7%, -0.7%; P < .001). Sensitivity was 69.0% (194 of 281) for SM + DBT and 70.5% (198 of 281) for DM + DBT, with a reader-adjusted difference of 1.0% (95% CI: -6.2%, 8.5%; P = .77). Specificity was 95.4% (FPF, 4.6%; 1111 of 24 020) for SM + DBT and 95.0% (FPF, 5.0%;1209 of 24 020) for DM + DBT, with reader-adjusted 95% CIs for FPF of 4.7%, 5.4% and 5.0%, 5.7%, respectively, and a difference of -0.3% (95% CI: -0.8%, 0.2%; P = .23). Differences in sensitivity and specificity with the addition of CAD were small and not significant (P > .2). Conclusion Addition of digital breast tomosynthesis to digital mammography resulted in significant gains in sensitivity and specificity. Synthetic mammography in combination with digital breast tomosynthesis had similar sensitivity and specificity to digital mammography in combination with digital breast tomosynthesis. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 See also the editorial by L\u00e5ng in this issue.",
        "Purpose To determine whether the predonation computed tomography (CT)-based volume of the future remnant kidney is predictive of postdonation renal function in living kidney donors. Materials and Methods This institutional review board-approved, retrospective, HIPAA-compliant study included 126 live kidney donors who had undergone predonation renal CT between January 2007 and December 2014 as well as 2-year postdonation measurement of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The whole kidney volume and cortical volume of the future remnant kidney were measured and standardized for body surface area (BSA). Bivariate linear associations between the ratios of whole kidney volume to BSA and cortical volume to BSA were obtained. A linear regression model for 2-year postdonation eGFR that incorporated donor age, sex, and either whole kidney volume-to-BSA ratio or cortical volume-to-BSA ratio was created, and the coefficient of determination (R2) for the model was calculated. Factors not statistically additive in assessing 2-year eGFR were removed by using backward elimination, and the coefficient of determination for this parsimonious model was calculated. Results Correlation was slightly better for cortical volume-to-BSA ratio than for whole kidney volume-to-BSA ratio (r = 0.48 vs r = 0.44, respectively). The linear regression model incorporating all donor factors had an R2 of 0.66. The only factors that were significantly additive to the equation were cortical volume-to-BSA ratio and predonation eGFR (P = .01 and P < .01, respectively), and the final parsimonious linear regression model incorporating these two variables explained almost the same amount of variance (R2 = 0.65) as did the full model. Conclusion The cortical volume of the future remnant kidney helped predict postdonation eGFR at 2 years. The cortical volume-to-BSA ratio should thus be considered for addition as an important variable to living kidney donor evaluation and selection guidelines. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018.",
        "With more than 900 000 confirmed cases worldwide and nearly 50 000 deaths during the first 3 months of 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has emerged as an unprecedented health care crisis. The spread of COVID-19 has been heterogeneous, resulting in some regions having sporadic transmission and relatively few hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and others having community transmission that has led to overwhelming numbers of severe cases. For these regions, health care delivery has been disrupted and compromised by critical resource constraints in diagnostic testing, hospital beds, ventilators, and health care workers who have fallen ill to the virus exacerbated by shortages of personal protective equipment. Although mild cases mimic common upper respiratory viral infections, respiratory dysfunction becomes the principal source of morbidity and mortality as the disease advances. Thoracic imaging with chest radiography and CT are key tools for pulmonary disease diagnosis and management, but their role in the management of COVID-19 has not been considered within the multivariable context of the severity of respiratory disease, pretest probability, risk factors for disease progression, and critical resource constraints. To address this deficit, a multidisciplinary panel comprised principally of radiologists and pulmonologists from 10 countries with experience managing patients with COVID-19 across a spectrum of health care environments evaluated the utility of imaging within three scenarios representing varying risk factors, community conditions, and resource constraints. Fourteen key questions, corresponding to 11 decision points within the three scenarios and three additional clinical situations, were rated by the panel based on the anticipated value of the information that thoracic imaging would be expected to provide. The results were aggregated, resulting in five main and three additional recommendations intended to guide medical practitioners in the use of chest radiography and CT in the management of COVID-19.",

        "Background Trends in the detection of suspicious microcalcifications at mammography screening and the yield of these lesions after recall are unknown. Purpose To determine trends in recall and outcome of screen-detected microcalcifications during 20 years of mammography screening. Materials and Methods The authors performed a retrospective analysis of a consecutive series of 817 656 screening examinations (January 1997 to January 2017) in a national breast screening program. In 2009-2010 (transition period), screen-film mammography (SFM) was gradually replaced by full-field digital mammography (FFDM). The recalls of suspicious microcalcifications from all radiology reports and pathologic outcome of recalled women with 2-year follow-up were analyzed. Screening outcome in the era of SFM (1997-2008), the transition period (2009-2010), and the era of FFDM (2011-2016) were compared. Trends over time and variations between the SFM and FFDM periods were expressed by using proportions with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). In cases where the analysis based on the CI confirmed clear periods (eg, before and after introduction of FFDM), pre- and postchange outcomes were compared by using \u03c72 tests. Results A total of 18 592 women (median age, 59 years; interquartile range, 14 years) were recalled at mammography screening, 3556 of whom had suspicious microcalcifications. The recall rate for microcalcifications increased from 0.1% in 1997-1998 to 0.5% in 2015-2016 (P < .001). This was temporally associated with the change from SFM to FFDM. The recalls yielding ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) increased from 0.3 per 1000 screening examinations with SFM to 1.1 per 1000 screening examinations with FFDM (P < .001), resulting in a decrease in the positive predictive value for recall for suspicious microcalcifications from 51% to 33% (P < .001). More than half of all DCIS lesions were high grade (52.6%; 393 of 747). The distribution of DCIS grades was stable during the 20-year screening period (P = .36). Conclusion The recall rate for suspicious microcalcifications at mammographic screening increased during the past 2 decades, whereas the ductal carcinoma in situ detection rate increased less rapidly, resulting in a lower positive predictive value for recall. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020.",
        "Background Deep learning reconstruction (DLR) may improve image quality. However, its impact on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of the prostate has yet to be assessed. Purpose To determine whether DLR can improve image quality of diffusion-weighted MRI at b values ranging from 1000 sec/mm2 to 5000 sec/mm2 in patients with prostate cancer. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, images of the prostate obtained at DWI with a b value of 0 sec/mm2, DWI with a b value of 1000 sec/mm2 (DWI1000), DWI with a b value of 3000 sec/mm2 (DWI3000), and DWI with a b value of 5000 sec/mm2 (DWI5000) from consecutive patients with biopsy-proven cancer from January to June 2020 were reconstructed with and without DLR. Image quality was assessed using signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) from region-of-interest analysis and qualitatively assessed using a five-point visual scoring system (1 [very poor] to 5 [excellent]) for each high-b-value DWI sequence with and without DLR. The SNR, CNR, and visual score for DWI with and without DLR were compared with the paired t test and the Wilcoxon signed rank test with Bonferroni correction, respectively. Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) from DWI with and without DLR were also compared with the paired t test with Bonferroni correction. Results A total of 60 patients (mean age, 67 years; age range, 49\u201379 years) were analyzed. DWI with DLR showed significantly higher SNRs and CNRs than DWI without DLR (P < .001); for example, with DWI1000 the mean SNR was 38.7 \u00b1 0.6 versus 17.8 \u00b1 0.6, respectively (P < .001), and the mean CNR was 18.4 \u00b1 5.6 versus 7.4 \u00b1 5.6, respectively (P < .001). DWI with DLR also demonstrated higher qualitative image quality than DWI without DLR (mean score: 4.8 \u00b1 0.4 vs 4.0 \u00b1 0.7, respectively, with DWI1000 [P = .001], 3.8 \u00b1 0.7 vs 3.0 \u00b1 0.8 with DWI3000 [P = .002], and 3.1 \u00b1 0.8 vs 2.0 \u00b1 0.9 with DWI5000 [P < .001]). ADCs derived with and without DLR did not differ substantially (P > .99). Conclusion Deep learning reconstruction improves the image quality of diffusion-weighted MRI scans of prostate cancer with no impact on apparent diffusion coefficient quantitation with a 3.0-T MRI system. \u00a9 RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Purpose To evaluate the effect of changes in hematocrit level on myocardial extracellular volume (ECV) fraction, as quantified with cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in an animal model. Materials and Methods Thirteen adult male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent cardiac MR imaging before and after induction of anemia. MR imaging procedures, including unenhanced and contrast material\u2013enhanced T1 mapping, were performed by using a saturation recovery Look-Locker sequence with a 9.4-T unit. An optimized T1 mapping sequence was established in the phantom study. Systolic function of the left ventricle (LV) was calculated from the cine images. Native and postcontrast T1 values of the LV myocardium at the midcavity level and LV blood pool, partition coefficients, and ECV were calculated. Histopathologic examination of the heart was performed after sacrifice. Intergroup comparison of variables was performed with the paired t test. Results The postanemia models exhibited lower hematocrit levels, postcontrast T1 values of the LV pool, and partition coefficients (mean, 45.7% \u00b1 5.2 [standard deviation]; 563.8 msec \u00b1 155.7; and 29.2 \u00b1 3.5, respectively) than did the preanemia models (mean, 59.0% \u00b1 4.1; 690.2 msec \u00b1 109.7; and 38.2 \u00b1 4.4, respectively) (P < .05 for all comparisons). There were no differences between the pre- and postanemia groups in terms of LV ejection fraction (mean, 72.7% \u00b1 2.1 vs 73.2% \u00b1 4.7; P = .78) and ECV (mean, 15.5% \u00b1 2.0 vs 16.0% \u00b1 1.9; P = .24). Conclusion Myocardial ECV measured with contrast-enhanced T1 mapping cardiac MR imaging did not significantly change despite changes in hematocrit level in anemic rat models. Extrapolation of this finding from animal models to human subjects suggests that ECV measured with MR imaging could be a robust parameter in anemic patients. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global health care emergency. Although reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction testing is the reference standard method to identify patients with COVID-19 infection, chest radiography and CT play a vital role in the detection and management of these patients. Prediction models for COVID-19 imaging are rapidly being developed to support medical decision making. However, inadequate availability of a diverse annotated data set has limited the performance and generalizability of existing models. To address this unmet need, the RSNA and Society of Thoracic Radiology collaborated to develop the RSNA International COVID-19 Open Radiology Database (RICORD). This database is the first multi-institutional, multinational, expert-annotated COVID-19 imaging data set. It is made freely available to the machine learning community as a research and educational resource for COVID-19 chest imaging. Pixel-level volumetric segmentation with clinical annotations was performed by thoracic radiology subspecialists for all COVID-19\u2013positive thoracic CT scans. The labeling schema was coordinated with other international consensus panels and COVID-19 data annotation efforts, the European Society of Medical Imaging Informatics, the American College of Radiology, and the American Association of Physicists in Medicine. Study-level COVID-19 classification labels for chest radiographs were annotated by three radiologists, with majority vote adjudication by board-certified radiologists. RICORD consists of 240 thoracic CT scans and 1000 chest radiographs contributed from four international sites. It is anticipated that RICORD will ideally lead to prediction models that can demonstrate sustained performance across populations and health care systems. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Background The prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with major portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) is dismal after standard treatment with sorafenib. Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) has been suggested for patients with HCC and major PVTT. Purpose To compare the efficacy and safety of sorafenib plus 3cir-OFF HAIC versus sorafenib alone for advanced HCC with major PVTT. Materials and Methods This phase II trial recruited systemic treatment-na\u00efve patients with HCC and major PVTT (portal vein invasion grade Vp3 [first branch] and Vp4 [main trunk]) between June 2017 and November 2019. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to receive sorafenib (400 mg twice daily) plus 3cir-OFF HAIC (35 mg/m2 oxaliplatin [hours 0\u20132] followed by 600 mg/m2 5-fluorouracil [hours 2\u201324], days 1\u20133) with a standardized percutaneous port catheter system or sorafenib alone (400 mg twice daily) every 4 weeks. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). The secondary end points were objective response rate, progression-free survival (PFS), and safety. OS and PFS were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Results The intent-to-treat population included 64 patients, with 32 in each group. The median OS was 16.3 months (95% CI: 0.0, 35.5) with sorafenib plus HAIC and 6.5 months (95% CI: 4.4, 8.6) with sorafenib alone (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.28; 95% CI: 0.15, 0.53; P < .001). A higher objective response rate (41% [n = 13] vs 3% [n = 1], P < .001) and a longer median PFS (9.0 months vs 2.5 months; HR = 0.26; 95% CI: 0.15, 0.47; P < .001) were observed in the sorafenib plus HAIC group. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were more frequent in the sorafenib plus HAIC group, including diarrhea (n = 7 [22%] vs n = 5 [16%]), hand-foot syndrome (n = 6 [19%] vs n = 2 [6%]), and thrombocytopenia (n = 7 [22%] vs n = 0). Conclusion Sorafenib plus 3cir-OFF hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy may be a promising treatment in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and major portal vein tumor thrombosis because of the improved survival and an acceptable safety profile.

        "Purpose To investigate the long-term course of MRI signal intensity (SI) changes and the presence of gadolinium in the rat brain during a 1-year period after multiple administrations of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs). Materials and Methods Rats received a linear GBCA (gadodiamide, gadopentetate dimeglumine, gadobenate dimeglumine), a macrocyclic GBCA (gadobutrol, gadoterate meglumine, gadoteridol), or saline. Animals received eight injections over 2 weeks (1.8 mmol/kg per injection). Brain MRI and gadolinium measurements were performed with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and laser ablation ICP-MS 5, 26, and 52 weeks after administration. Results Animals that received linear GBCAs showed higher deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN)-to-brainstem SI ratios compared with the saline group (P < .001 at all time points). After 1 year, mean gadolinium concentrations in the cerebellum were 3.38 nmol/g (gadodiamide), 2.13 nmol/g (gadopentetate dimeglumine), and 1.91 nmol/g (gadobenate dimeglumine). For linear agents, laser ablation ICP-MS revealed gadolinium depositions in the cerebellar nuclei. For macrocyclic GBCAs, the DCN-to-brainstem SI ratios did not significantly differ from those in the saline group (P > .42) and the cerebellar gadolinium concentrations decreased between weeks 5 and 52, reaching 0.08 nmol/g (gadobutrol), 0.04 nmol/g (gadoterate meglumine), and 0.07 nmol/g (gadoteridol). The respective laser ablation ICP-MS analysis showed no gadolinium depositions. Conclusion Increased signal intensity in the deep cerebellar nuclei of rats persists for at least 1 year after administration of linear gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs), in line with persistent brain gadolinium concentrations with no elimination after the initial 5-week period. The animals that received macrocyclic GBCAs showed an ongoing elimination of gadolinium from the brain during the entire observation period. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018.",
        "Background Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) are heterogeneous neoplasms, and the prognosis varies based on the subtype. Two broad molecular classes of HCC have been proposed: a proliferative and a nonproliferative class. Purpose To evaluate the gadoxetate-enhanced MRI findings of the proliferative class HCC and its prognostic significance after surgery. Materials and Methods This retrospective cohort study evaluated patients with surgically resected treatment-naive single HCC (\u22645 cm) who underwent hepatic resection from January 2010 through February 2013 and preoperative gadoxetate-enhanced MRI. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine the predictive factors for overall survival (OS), intrahepatic distant recurrence, and extrahepatic metastasis (EM). The mean follow-up period was 75.5 months \u00b1 30.2 (standard deviation). Multivariable logistic regression was performed to determine factors associated with proliferative class HCC. Results A total of 158 patients (mean age, 57 years \u00b1 11; 128 men and 30 women) were evaluated. Forty-two of the 158 HCCs (26.6%) were proliferative class HCCs (17 macrotrabecular-massive HCCs, 14 keratin 19\u2013positive HCCs, 10 scirrhous HCCs, and one sarcomatoid HCC). The proliferative class was associated with worse OS (hazard ratio [HR], 3.1; 95% CI: 1.5, 6.0; P = .01) and higher rates of intrahepatic distant recurrence (HR, 1.83; 95% CI: 1.1, 2.9; P = .01) and EM (HR, 9.97; 95% CI: 3.2, 31.4; P < .001). Rim arterial phase hyperenhancement (APHE) at gadoxetate-enhanced MRI (odds ratio [OR], 6.35; 95% CI: 1.9, 21.7; P = .01) and high serum \u03b1-fetoprotein (>100 ng/mL) (OR, 4.18; 95% CI: 1.64, 10.7; P = .01) were independent predictors for proliferative HCC. The presence of rim APHE was associated with poor OS (HR, 2.4; 95% CI: 1.2, 4.9; P = .02) and higher rates of EM (HR, 7.4; 95% CI: 2.5, 21.7; P < .01). Conclusion The proliferative class of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an independent factor for poor overall survival with increased rates of intrahepatic and extrahepatic metastasis. Rim arterial phase hyperenhancement at gadoxetate-enhanced MRI may help to identify proliferative class HCC and predict poor overall survival and an increased incidence of extrahepatic metastasis. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Purpose To retrospectively assess whether there is an association between screening mammography and the use of a variety of preventive services in women who are enrolled in Medicare. Materials and Methods U.S. Medicare claims from 2010 to 2014 Research Identifiable Files were reviewed to retrospectively identify a group of women who underwent screening mammography and a control group without screening mammography in 2012. The screened group was divided into positive versus negative results at screening, and the positive subgroup was divided into false-positive and true-positive findings. Multivariate logistic regression models and inverse probability of treatment weighting were used to examine the relationship between screening status and the probabilities of undergoing Papanicolaou test, bone mass measurement, or influenza vaccination in the following 2 years. Results The cohort consisted of 555 705 patients, of whom 185 625 (33.4%) underwent mammography. After adjusting for patient demographics, comorbidities, geographic covariates, and baseline preventive care, women who underwent index screening mammography (with either positive or negative results) were more likely than unscreened women to later undergo Papanicolaou test (odds ratio [OR], 1.49; 95% confidence interval: 1.40, 1.58), bone mass measurement (OR, 1.70; 95% confidence interval: 1.63, 1.78), and influenza vaccine (OR, 1.45; 95% confidence interval: 1.37, 1.53). In women who had not undergone these preventive measures in the 2 years before screening mammography, use of these three services after false-positive findings at screening was no different than after true-negative findings at screening. Conclusion In beneficiaries of U.S. Medicare, use of screening mammography was associated with higher likelihood of adherence to other preventive guidelines, without a negative association between false-positive results and cervical cancer screening.",
        "History A 29-year-old woman presented with a 6-month history of progressive general fatigue, fluctuating limb weakness, and difficulty climbing stairs. She initially experienced occasional episodes of transient diplopia that developed while reading in the evening. She subsequently started to experience dry eyes and mouth, difficulty chewing, and mild dysphagia that worsened throughout the day. Her medical history included hypothyroidism from Hashimoto thyroiditis and pneumonia with left pleural effusion. She had no smoking history, and her body mass index was normal (23.8 kg/m2). No medication use was reported at admission. Physical examination revealed mild bilateral ptosis, reduced muscle tone and strength that worsened in proximal leg muscles, and decreased deep tendon reflexes. An edrophonium test revealed improvement in muscle strength and eyelid ptosis. Repetitive nerve stimulation revealed low amplitude of compound muscle action potential at rest (0.21 mV), with a marked increase (700%; normal increase, <60%) at high-rate stimulation (50 Hz). Laboratory work-up was unremarkable except for detection of acetylcholine receptor antibodies in the serum (21.30 nmol/L) and P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel antibodies (220 pmol/L). Recent MRI of the brain and spine at an outside hospital showed no abnormal findings. At admission, the patient underwent CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis ( Fig 1 ) followed by thoracic MRI ( Figs 2 , 3 ) to further evaluate CT findings.

        "History A 57-year-old man with no remarkable past medical history presented to an outside institution with painless swelling in his right thigh of 6 months duration. He denied any trauma to the site. At that time, physical examination demonstrated swelling in his right upper thigh. All other work-up, including complete blood count and chest radiography, yielded negative results. The initial diagnosis was lymphangioma of the thigh. He continued to experience worsening swelling in his right upper thigh with no other symptoms over the next year. He was referred to our facility, where he underwent US evaluation of the thigh lesion (Fig 1), an MRI scan encompassing the entire extent of his thigh lesion (Fig 2), and a CT scan of his abdomen and pelvis (Fig 3).",
        "History An 18-year-old man was diagnosed with precursor B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia and underwent transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells from his human leukocyte antigen-matched sister 1 year prior to admission. He was admitted to evaluate progressive shortness of breath and dry cough of 1-month duration. He did not report fever, night sweats, or hemoptysis. Physical examination revealed he was afebrile and had normal pulse oxygen saturation. The examination revealed crepitation on palpation of the anterior neck, expiratory wheezes, and crackles heard at auscultation of bases of both lungs. Extensive maculopapular rash on the skin was consistent with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Laboratory tests revealed elevated liver transaminase and bilirubin levels that were attributed to liver GVHD. Nonenhanced thin-section CT of the chest was performed (Figs 1-5).",
        "BackgroundContrast agent-enhanced digital mammography (CEDM) has been shown to be more sensitive and specific than two-dimensional full-field digital mammography in the diagnostic setting. Few studies have reported on its performance in the screening setting.PurposeTo evaluate the performance of CEDM for breast cancer screening.Materials and MethodsThis retrospective study included women who underwent dual-energy CEDM for breast cancer screening from December 2012 through April 2016. Medical records were reviewed for age, risk factors, short-interval follow-up and biopsies recommended, and cancers detected. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value of abnormal findings at screening (PPV1), positive predictive value of biopsy performed (PPV3), and negative predictive value were determined.ResultsIn the study period 904 baseline CEDMs were performed. Mean age was 51.8 years \u00b1 9.4 (standard deviation). Of 904 patients, 700 (77.4%) had dense breasts, 247 (27.3%) had a family history of breast cancer in a first-degree relative age 50 years or younger, and 363 (40.2%) a personal history of breast cancer. The final Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System score was 1 or 2 in 832 of 904 (92.0%) patients, score of 3 in 25 of 904 (2.8%) patients, and score of 4 or 5 in 47 of 904 (5.2%) patients. By using CEDM, 15 cancers were diagnosed in 14 of 904 women (cancer detection rate, 15.5 of 1000). PPV3 was 29.4% (15 of 51). At least 1-year follow up was available in 858 women. There were two interval cancers. Sensitivity was 50.0% (eight of 16; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 24.7%, 75.3%) on the low-energy images compared with 87.5% (14 of 16; 95% CI: 61.7%, 98.4%) for the entire study (low-energy and iodine images; P = .03).

        "Purpose To compare the performance of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) and two-dimensional synthetic mammography (SM) with that of digital mammography (DM) in a population-based mammographic screening program. Materials and Methods In this prospective cohort study, data from 37 185 women screened with DBT and SM and from 61 742 women screened with DM as part of a population-based screening program in 2014 and 2015 were included. Early performance measures, including recall rate due to abnormal mammographic findings, rate of screen-detected breast cancer, positive predictive value of recall, positive predictive value of needle biopsy, histopathologic type, tumor size, tumor grade, lymph node involvement, hormonal status, Ki-67 level, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status were compared in women who underwent DBT and SM screening and in those who underwent DM screening by using \u03c72 tests, two-sample unpaired t tests, and tests of proportions. Results Recall rates were 3.4% for DBT and SM screening and 3.3% for DM screening (P = .563). DBT and SM screening showed a significantly higher rate of screen-detected cancer compared with DM screening (9.4 vs 6.1 cancers per 1000 patients screened, respectively; P < .001). The rate of detection of tumors 10 mm or smaller was 3.2 per 1000 patients screened with DBT and SM and 1.8 per 1000 patients screened with DM (P < .001), and the rate of grade 1 tumors was 3.3 per 1000 patients screened with DBT and SM versus 1.4 per 1000 patients screened with DM (P < .001). On the basis of immunohistochemical analyses, rates of lymph node involvement and tumor subtypes did not differ between women who underwent DBT and SM screening and those who underwent DM screening. Conclusion DBT and SM screening increased the detection rate of histologically favorable tumors compared with that attained with DM screening. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Invasive coronary angiography (ICA) with measurement of fractional flow reserve (FFR) by means of a pressure wire technique is the established reference standard for the functional assessment of coronary artery disease (CAD) ( 1 , 2 ). Coronary computed tomographic (CT) angiography has emerged as a noninvasive method for direct assessment of CAD and plaque characterization with high diagnostic accuracy compared with ICA ( 3 , 4 ). However, the solely anatomic assessment provided with both coronary CT angiography and ICA has poor discriminatory power for ischemia-inducing lesions. FFR derived from standard coronary CT angiography (FFRCT) data sets by using any of several advanced computational analytic approaches enables combined anatomic and hemodynamic assessment of a coronary lesion by a single noninvasive test. Current technical approaches to the calculation of FFRCT include algorithms based on full- and reduced-order computational fluid dynamic modeling, as well as artificial intelligence deep machine learning ( 5 , 6 ). A growing body of evidence has validated the diagnostic accuracy of FFRCT techniques compared with invasive FFR. Improved therapeutic guidance has been demonstrated, showing the potential of FFRCT to streamline and rationalize the care of patients suspected of having CAD and improve outcomes while reducing overall health care costs ( 7 , 8 ). The purpose of this review is to describe the scientific principles, clinical validation, and implementation of various FFRCT approaches, their precursors, and related imaging tests. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017.",
        "Purpose To compare the diagnostic performance of radiomic analysis (RA) and a convolutional neural network (CNN) to radiologists for classification of contrast agent-enhancing lesions as benign or malignant at multiparametric breast MRI. Materials and Methods Between August 2011 and August 2015, 447 patients with 1294 enhancing lesions (787 malignant, 507 benign; median size, 15 mm \u00b1 20) were evaluated. Lesions were manually segmented by one breast radiologist. RA was performed by using L1 regularization and principal component analysis. CNN used a deep residual neural network with 34 layers. All algorithms were also retrained on half the number of lesions (n = 647). Machine interpretations were compared with prospective interpretations by three breast radiologists. Standard of reference was histologic analysis or follow-up. Areas under the receiver operating curve (AUCs) were used to compare diagnostic performance. Results CNN trained on the full cohort was superior to training on the half-size cohort (AUC, 0.88 vs 0.83, respectively; P = .01), but there was no difference for RA and L1 regularization (AUC, 0.81 vs 0.80, respectively; P = .76) or RA and principal component analysis (AUC, 0.78 vs 0.78, respectively; P = .93). By using the full cohort, CNN performance (AUC, 0.88; 95% confidence interval: 0.86, 0.89) was better than RA and L1 regularization (AUC, 0.81; 95% confidence interval: 0.79, 0.83; P < .001) and RA and principal component analysis (AUC, 0.78; 95% confidence interval: 0.76, 0.80; P < .001). However, CNN was inferior to breast radiologist interpretation (AUC, 0.98; 95% confidence interval: 0.96, 0.99; P < .001). Conclusion A convolutional neural network was superior to radiomic analysis for classification of enhancing lesions as benign or malignant at multiparametric breast MRI. Both approaches were inferior to radiologists' performance; however, more training data will further improve performance of convolutional neural network, but not that of radiomics algorithms. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Background There is significant pulmonary functional deficit related to obesity, but no prospective CT studies have evaluated the effects of obesity on the lungs and trachea. Purpose To evaluate lung parenchymal and tracheal CT morphology before and 6 months after bariatric surgery, with functional and symptomatic correlation. Materials and Methods A prospective longitudinal study of 51 consecutive individuals referred for bariatric surgery was performed (from November 2011 to November 2013). All individuals had undergone limited (three-location) inspiratory and end-expiratory thoracic CT before and after surgery, with concurrent pulmonary function testing, body mass index calculation, and modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale and Epworth scoring. Two thoracic radiologists scored the CT extent of mosaic attenuation, end-expiratory air trapping, and tracheal shape. The inspiratory and end-expiratory cross-sectional areas of the trachea were measured. The paired t test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for pre- and postsurgical comparisons. Spearman correlation and logistic regression were used to evaluate correlations between CT findings and functional and symptom indexes. Results A total of 51 participants (mean age, 52 years \u00b1 8 [standard deviation]; 20 men) were evaluated. Before surgery, air trapping extent correlated most strongly with decreased total lung capacity (Spearman rank correlation coefficient [rs] = -0.40, P = .004). After surgery, there were decreases in percentage mosaic attenuation (0% [interquartile range {IQR}: 0%\u20132.5%] vs 0% [IQR: 0%\u20130%], P < .001), air trapping (9.6% [IQR: 5.8%\u201315.8%] vs 2.5% [IQR: 0%\u20136.7%], P < .001), and tracheal collapse (201 mm2 [IQR: 181\u2013239 mm2] vs 229 mm2 [186\u2013284 mm2], P < .001). After surgery, mMRC dyspnea score change correlated positively with air trapping extent change (rs = 0.46, P = .001) and end-expiratory tracheal shape change (rs = 0.40, P = .01). At multivariable analysis, air trapping was the main determinant for decreased dyspnea after surgery (odds ratio, 1.2; 95% confidence interval: 1.1, 1.2; P = .03). Conclusion Dyspnea improved in obese participants after weight reduction, which correlated with less tracheal collapse and air trapping at end-expiration chest CT. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",

Lesions were detected with PI-RADS version 2 and were compared with whole-mount prostatectomy findings. Probability of cancer detection for overall, T2-weighted, and diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging PI-RADS scores was calculated in the peripheral zone (PZ) and transition zone (TZ) by using generalized estimating equations. To determine dominant pulse sequence and benefit of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging, odds ratios (ORs) were calculated as the ratio of odds of cancer of two consecutive scores by logistic regression. Results A total of 654 lesions (420 in the PZ) were detected. The probability of cancer detection for PI-RADS category 2, 3, 4, and 5 lesions was 15.7%, 33.1%, 70.5%, and 90.7%, respectively. DW imaging outperformed T2-weighted imaging in the PZ (OR, 3.49 vs 2.45; P = .008). T2-weighted imaging performed better but did not clearly outperform DW imaging in the TZ (OR, 4.79 vs 3.77; P = .494). Lesions classified as PI-RADS category 3 at DW MR imaging and as positive at DCE imaging in the PZ showed a higher probability of cancer detection than did DCE-negative PI-RADS category 3 lesions (67.8% vs 40.0%, P = .02). The addition of DCE imaging to DW imaging in the PZ was beneficial (OR, 2.0; P = .027), with an increase in the probability of cancer detection of 15.7%, 16.0%, and 9.2% for PI-RADS category 2, 3, and 4 lesions, respectively. Conclusion DW imaging outperforms T2-weighted imaging in the PZ; T2-weighted imaging did not show a significant difference when compared with DW imaging in the TZ by PI-RADS version 2 criteria. The addition of DCE imaging to DW imaging scores in the PZ yields meaningful improvements in probability of cancer detection. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 An earlier incorrect version of this article appeared online.

        "Background Mammographic density improves the accuracy of breast cancer risk models. However, the use of breast density is limited by subjective assessment, variation across radiologists, and restricted data. A mammography-based deep learning (DL) model may provide more accurate risk prediction. Purpose To develop a mammography-based DL breast cancer risk model that is more accurate than established clinical breast cancer risk models. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included 88 994 consecutive screening mammograms in 39 571 women between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2012. For each patient, all examinations were assigned to either training, validation, or test sets, resulting in 71 689, 8554, and 8751 examinations, respectively. Cancer outcomes were obtained through linkage to a regional tumor registry. By using risk factor information from patient questionnaires and electronic medical records review, three models were developed to assess breast cancer risk within 5 years: a risk-factor-based logistic regression model (RF-LR) that used traditional risk factors, a DL model (image-only DL) that used mammograms alone, and a hybrid DL model that used both traditional risk factors and mammograms. Comparisons were made to an established breast cancer risk model that included breast density (Tyrer-Cuzick model, version 8 [TC]). Model performance was compared by using areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) with DeLong test (P < .05). Results The test set included 3937 women, aged 56.20 years \u00b1 10.04. Hybrid DL and image-only DL showed AUCs of 0.70 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.66, 0.75) and 0.68 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.73), respectively. RF-LR and TC showed AUCs of 0.67 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.72) and 0.62 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.66), respectively. Hybrid DL showed a significantly higher AUC (0.70) than TC (0.62; P < .001) and RF-LR (0.67; P = .01). Conclusion Deep learning models that use full-field mammograms yield substantially improved risk discrimination compared with the Tyrer-Cuzick (version 8) model. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Purpose To investigate neural substrates underlying attention deficit in patients with chronic subcortical stroke by combining voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) and diffusion-tensor (DT) tractography. Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval and written informed consent were obtained. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging data were prospectively acquired from August 1, 2014, to March 30, 2015, in 49 patients (32 men, 17 women; mean age, 55.7 years \u00b1 8.0; age range, 40-71 years) with subcortical infarctions in the basal ganglia and neighboring regions and 52 control subjects (30 men, 22 women; mean age, 54.4 years \u00b1 7.5; age range, 40-68 years). A modified version of the attention network test was used to assess visual attention function. On the basis of the lesion map at the acute stage, VLSM was used to identify lesion locations related to attention deficit in patients with stroke. DT tractography then was used to determine the responsible impaired connections by using diffusion data at the chronic stage (>6 months after stroke). Results When compared with control subjects, patients with chronic stroke exhibited prolonged reaction time (RT) of correct responses (P = .009). VLSM revealed that acute stroke lesion in the right caudate nucleus and nearby white matter (found in seven patients) was correlated with the prolonged RT (P < .05). DTT showed that the responsible lesion was located in the right thalamic- and caudate-prefrontal pathways in control subjects. The subgroup with right-sided brain damage had significantly decreased fractional anisotropy in these pathways (P < .001), which were correlated with the prolonged RT (P = .009 for the thalamic-prefrontal pathway, P < .001 for the caudate-prefrontal pathway). Conclusion Thalamic-prefrontal and caudate-prefrontal pathways impaired by stroke lesions appear to underlie attention deficit in patients with subcortical stroke in the right hemisphere.",
        "Background Tumor perfusion may inform therapeutic response and resistance in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) treated with antiangiogenic therapy. Purpose To determine if arterial spin labeled (ASL) MRI perfusion changes are associated with tumor response and disease progression in metastatic RCC treated with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Materials and Methods In this prospective study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00749320), metastatic RCC perfusion was measured with ASL MRI before and during sunitinib or pazopanib therapy between October 2008 and March 2014. Objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) were calculated. Perfusion was compared between responders and nonresponders at baseline, at week 2, after cycle 2 (12 weeks), after cycle 4 (24 weeks), and at disease progression and compared with the ORR by using the Wilcoxon rank sum test and with PFS by using the log-rank test. Results Seventeen participants received sunitinib (mean age, 59 years \u00b1 7.0 [standard deviation]; 11 men); 11 participants received pazopanib (mean age, 63 years \u00b1 6.6; eight men). Responders had higher baseline tumor perfusion than nonresponders (mean, 404 mL/100 g/min \u00b1 213 vs 199 mL/100 g/min \u00b1 136; P = .02). Perfusion decreased from baseline to week 2 (-53 mL/100 g/min \u00b1 31; P < .001), after cycle 2 (-65 mL/100 g/min \u00b1 25; P < .001), and after cycle 4 (-79 mL/100 g/min \u00b1 15; P = .008). Interval reduction in perfusion at those three time points was not associated with ORR (P = .63, .29, and .27, respectively) or PFS (P = .28, .27, and .32). Perfusion increased from cycle 4 to disease progression (51% \u00b1 11; P < .001). Conclusion Arterial spin labeled perfusion MRI may assist in identifying responders to vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors and may help detect early evidence of disease progression in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Purpose To evaluate the performance of a deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) model compared with a traditional natural language processing (NLP) model in extracting pulmonary embolism (PE) findings from thoracic computed tomography (CT) reports from two institutions. Materials and Methods Contrast material\u2013enhanced CT examinations of the chest performed between January 1, 1998, and January 1, 2016, were selected. Annotations by two human radiologists were made for three categories: the presence, chronicity, and location of PE. Classification of performance of a CNN model with an unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining vector representations of words was compared with the open-source application PeFinder. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and F1 scores for both the CNN model and PeFinder in the internal and external validation sets were determined. Results The CNN model demonstrated an accuracy of 99% and an area under the curve value of 0.97. For internal validation report data, the CNN model had a statistically significant larger F1 score (0.938) than did PeFinder (0.867) when classifying findings as either PE positive or PE negative, but no significant difference in sensitivity, specificity, or accuracy was found. For external validation report data, no statistical difference between the performance of the CNN model and PeFinder was found. Conclusion A deep learning CNN model can classify radiology free-text reports with accuracy equivalent to or beyond that of an existing traditional NLP model. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Background Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) may be cured with radiation therapy. Tumor proximity to critical structures demands accuracy in tumor delineation to avoid toxicities from radiation therapy; however, tumor target contouring for head and neck radiation therapy is labor intensive and highly variable among radiation oncologists. Purpose To construct and validate an artificial intelligence (AI) contouring tool to automate primary gross tumor volume (GTV) contouring in patients with NPC. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, MRI data sets covering the nasopharynx from 1021 patients (median age, 47 years; 751 male, 270 female) with NPC between September 2016 and September 2017 were collected and divided into training, validation, and testing cohorts of 715, 103, and 203 patients, respectively. GTV contours were delineated for 1021 patients and were defined by consensus of two experts. A three-dimensional convolutional neural network was applied to 818 training and validation MRI data sets to construct the AI tool, which was tested in 203 independent MRI data sets. Next, the AI tool was compared against eight qualified radiation oncologists in a multicenter evaluation by using a random sample of 20 test MRI examinations. The Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test was used to compare the difference of Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of pre- versus post-AI assistance. Results The AI-generated contours demonstrated a high level of accuracy when compared with ground truth contours at testing in 203 patients (DSC, 0.79; 2.0-mm difference in average surface distance). In multicenter evaluation, AI assistance improved contouring accuracy (five of eight oncologists had a higher median DSC after AI assistance; average median DSC, 0.74 vs 0.78; P < .001), reduced intra- and interobserver variation (by 36.4% and 54.5%, respectively), and reduced contouring time (by 39.4%). Conclusion The AI contouring tool improved primary gross tumor contouring accuracy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, which could have a positive impact on tumor control and patient survival. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Background Men suspected of having clinically significant prostate cancer (sPC) increasingly undergo prostate MRI. The potential of deep learning to provide diagnostic support for human interpretation requires further evaluation. Purpose To compare the performance of clinical assessment to a deep learning system optimized for segmentation trained with T2-weighted and diffusion MRI in the task of detection and segmentation of lesions suspicious for sPC. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, T2-weighted and diffusion prostate MRI sequences from consecutive men examined with a single 3.0-T MRI system between 2015 and 2016 were manually segmented. Ground truth was provided by combined targeted and extended systematic MRI-transrectal US fusion biopsy, with sPC defined as International Society of Urological Pathology Gleason grade group greater than or equal to 2. By using split-sample validation, U-Net was internally validated on the training set (80% of the data) through cross validation and subsequently externally validated on the test set (20% of the data). U-Net-derived sPC probability maps were calibrated by matching sextant-based cross-validation performance to clinical performance of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS). Performance of PI-RADS and U-Net were compared by using sensitivities, specificities, predictive values, and Dice coefficient. Results A total of 312 men (median age, 64 years; interquartile range [IQR], 58-71 years) were evaluated. The training set consisted of 250 men (median age, 64 years; IQR, 58-71 years) and the test set of 62 men (median age, 64 years; IQR, 60-69 years). In the test set, PI-RADS cutoffs greater than or equal to 3 versus cutoffs greater than or equal to 4 on a per-patient basis had sensitivity of 96% (25 of 26) versus 88% (23 of 26) at specificity of 22% (eight of 36) versus 50% (18 of 36). U-Net at probability thresholds of greater than or equal to 0.22 versus greater than or equal to 0.33 had sensitivity of 96% (25 of 26) versus 92% (24 of 26) (both P > .99) with specificity of 31% (11 of 36) versus 47% (17 of 36) (both P > .99), not statistically different from PI-RADS. Dice coefficients were 0.89 for prostate and 0.35 for MRI lesion segmentation. In the test set, coincidence of PI-RADS greater than or equal to 4 with U-Net lesions improved the positive predictive value from 48% (28 of 58) to 67% (24 of 36) for U-Net probability thresholds greater than or equal to 0.33 (P = .01), while the negative predictive value remained unchanged (83% [25 of 30] vs 83% [43 of 52]; P > .99). Conclusion U-Net trained with T2-weighted and diffusion MRI achieves similar performance to clinical Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System assessment. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Polypoid lesions of the gallbladder (PLG) are a common finding on trans-abdominal ultrasound scan (USS). Once discovered the exact nature of the PLG must be elucidated to avoid unnecessary removal of benign lesions. This is particularly difficult for the intermediate sized PLG (5-15 mm). Recent developments, however, such as the higher resolution of USS and the availability of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), mean that the management of PLG can be refined. In this review we outline methods for differentiating malignant from benign lesions and discuss their appropriate management.",
        "Background Smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have smaller left ventricles (LVs) due to reduced preload. Skeletal muscle wasting is also common in COPD, but less is known about its contribution to LV size. Purpose To explore the relationships between CT metrics of emphysema, venous vascular volume, and sarcopenia with the LV epicardial volume (LVEV) (myocardium and chamber) estimated from chest CT images in participants with COPD and then to determine the clinical relevance of the LVEV in multivariable models, including sex and anthropomorphic metrics. Materials and Methods The COPDGene study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00608764) is an ongoing prospective longitudinal observational investigation that began in 2006. LVEV, distal pulmonary venous blood volume for vessels smaller than 5 mm2 in cross section (BV5), CT emphysema, and pectoralis muscle area were retrospectively extracted from 3318 nongated, unenhanced COPDGene CT scans. Multivariable linear and Cox regression models were used to explore the association between emphysema, venous BV5, pectoralis muscle area, and LVEV as well as the association of LVEV with health status using the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire, 6-minute walk distance, and all-cause mortality. Results The median age of the cohort was 64 years (interquartile range, 57-70 years). Of the 2423 participants, 1806 were men and 617 were African American. The median LVEV between Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 1 and GOLD 4 COPD was reduced by 13.9% in women and 17.7% in men (P < .001 for both). In fully adjusted models, higher emphysema percentage (\u03b2 = -4.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -5.0, -3.4; P < .001), venous BV5 (\u03b2 = 7.0; 95% CI: 5.7, 8.2; P < .001), and pectoralis muscle area (\u03b2 = 2.7; 95% CI: 1.2, 4.1; P < .001) were independently associated with reduced LVEV. Reductions in LVEV were associated with improved health status (\u03b2 = 0.3; 95% CI: 0.1, 0.4) and 6-minute walk distance (\u03b2 = -12.2; 95% CI: -15.2, -9.3). These effects were greater in women than in men. The effect of reduced LVEV on mortality (hazard ratio: 1.07; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.09) did not vary by sex. Conclusion In women more than men with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a reduction in the estimated left ventricle epicardial volume correlated with a loss of pulmonary venous vasculature, greater pectoralis muscle sarcopenia, and lower all-cause mortality. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To validate ferumoxytol-based quantitative blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) MRI for mapping oxygenation of human infiltrative astrocytomas by using intraoperative measurement of tissue oxygen tension and histologic staining. Materials and Methods Fifteen patients with infiltrative astrocytomas were recruited into this prospective multicenter study between July 2014 and December 2016. Prior to treatment, participants underwent preoperative quantitative BOLD MRI with ferumoxytol to generate tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) maps. Two intratumoral sites were identified, one with low StO2 and one with high StO2. Neuronavigation was used to locate sites intraoperatively for insertion of oxygen-sensing probes to measure local tissue oxygen tension (PtO2). Biopsies from both sites were taken and stained for markers of hypoxia (hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1, carbonic anhydrase IX) and neoangiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor, endoglin [CD105]). Spearman correlation and nonparametric sign-rank tests were used to analyze data. Results Ten patients with median age of 58.5 years (interquartile range, 25 years; four men and six women) completed the study. Because there is no linear relationship between StO2 and PtO2, the ratios of low to high StO2 versus low to high PtO2 in each patient were compared and a significant correlation was found (r = 0.73; P = .01). Pathologic analyses revealed differences between carbonic anhydrase IX (P = .03) for sites of low StO2 versus high StO2. CD105 displayed a similar trend but was not significant (P = .09). Conclusion Ferumoxytol-based quantitative blood oxygenation level-dependent MRI can potentially be used as a noninvasive surrogate for oxygenation mapping in infiltrative astrocytomas. This technique can potentially be integrated in treatment planning for aggressive targeting of hypoxic areas in tumors.",
        "Purpose To investigate the fat-water content of Achilles tendon xanthomas at baseline and after treatment and to compare this assessment with that of ultrasonography (US) and other magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-based parameters. Materials and Methods Forty-eight Achilles tendons with clinically apparent xanthomas in 24 patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) (six men, 18 women; mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 58 years \u00b1 9) were compared with 20 Achilles tendons in 10 control subjects without FH (two men, eight women; mean age, 62 years \u00b1 7). US imaging measurements (thickness, width, cross-sectional area, echogenicity) and 3.0-T MR imaging measurements (thickness, width, cross-sectional area, volume, and fat-water separation) of the Achilles tendons were obtained at baseline and in patients with FH at 3 and 6 months after treatment with probucol, a cholesterol-lowering agent. Nonparametric tests compared baseline data, whereas repeated-measures analyses assessed treatment change. Results At baseline, all US and MR imaging-based parameters were higher in xanthoma tendons compared with those in control tendons (all P < .05). The mean relative water content per unit volume was 71% higher (42.0% \u00b1 6.7) in xanthoma tendons than in control tendons (24.5% 6 5.8; P < .001). After 6 months of cholesterol-lowering treatment, only MR imaging measurements of tendon volume (P = .007), relative fat (P = .041), and relative water content (P < .001) showed significant changes. As relative tendon fat content decreased with treatment, relative water content increased. Conclusion Most of the enlargement of Achilles tendon xanthomas is due to an increase in water content rather than fat. For depicting treatment change, relative tendon water content was the most sensitive parameter, followed by tendon volume and relative tendon fat content. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "A 61-year-old woman was admitted to our institution to characterize an incidentally found mass in the porta hepatis. An episode of pulmonary embolism (18 months ago) and a pulmonary abscess (15 months ago) were reported. The patient had no history of known liver disease, previous cancer diagnosis, or trauma. She underwent total thyroidectomy for goiter several years ago, with initial iatrogenic hypothyroidism treated with levo-thyroxine hormone replacement therapy. During follow-up, this therapy was adjusted (50 \u00b5g per day) to induce euthyroidism and to achieve a target serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration of 1-2 mIU/L. Physical examination findings were unremarkable. Admission laboratory data were entirely normal, including tumor markers, such as carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9. Unenhanced (Fig 1) and multiphasic contrast-enhanced CT imaging was performed in arterial (Fig 2A), portal venous (Fig 2B), and delayed (3 minutes after injection) (Fig 2C) phases. Axial and coronal maximum intensity projection reconstructed CT images were obtained in the arterial (Fig 3) and portal venous (Fig 4) phases.

        "Purpose To develop a deep learning (DL) algorithm to assess mammographic breast density. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, a deep convolutional neural network was trained to assess Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) breast density based on the original interpretation by an experienced radiologist of 41 479 digital screening mammograms obtained in 27 684 women from January 2009 to May 2011. The resulting algorithm was tested on a held-out test set of 8677 mammograms in 5741 women. In addition, five radiologists performed a reader study on 500 mammograms randomly selected from the test set. Finally, the algorithm was implemented in routine clinical practice, where eight radiologists reviewed 10 763 consecutive mammograms assessed with the model. Agreement on BI-RADS category for the DL model and for three sets of readings-(a) radiologists in the test set, (b) radiologists working in consensus in the reader study set, and (c) radiologists in the clinical implementation set-were estimated with linear-weighted \u03ba statistics and were compared across 5000 bootstrap samples to assess significance. Results The DL model showed good agreement with radiologists in the test set (\u03ba = 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.66, 0.68) and with radiologists in consensus in the reader study set (\u03ba = 0.78; 95% CI: 0.73, 0.82). There was very good agreement (\u03ba = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.84, 0.86) with radiologists in the clinical implementation set; for binary categorization of dense or nondense breasts, 10 149 of 10 763 (94%; 95% CI: 94%, 95%) DL assessments were accepted by the interpreting radiologist.

To convert different kernels without sinogram, the CNN model was developed using residual learning and an end-to-end way. Kernel-converted images were generated, from B30f to B50f and from B50f to B30f. Pulmonary nodules or masses were semiautomatically segmented and 702 radiomic features (tumor intensity, texture, and wavelet features) were extracted. Measurement variability in radiomic features was evaluated using the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). Results A total of 104 patients were studied, including 54 women and 50 men, with pulmonary nodules or masses (mean age, 63.2 years \u00b1 10.5). The CCC between two readers using the same kernel was 0.92, and 592 of 702 (84.3%) of the radiomic features were reproducible (CCC \u2265 0.85); using different kernels, the CCC was 0.38 and only 107 of 702 (15.2%) of the radiomic features were reliable. Texture features and wavelet features were predominantly affected by reconstruction kernel (CCC, from 0.88 to 0.61 for texture features and from 0.92 to 0.35 for wavelet features). After applying image conversion, CCC improved to 0.84 and 403 of 702 (57.4%) radiomic features were reproducible (CCC, 0.85 for texture features and 0.84 for wavelet features). Conclusion Chest CT image conversion using a convolutional neural network effectively reduced the effect of two different reconstruction kernels and may improve the reproducibility of radiomic features in pulmonary nodules or masses. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Purpose To determine the diagnostic accuracy for clinically significant prostate cancer achieved with abbreviated biparametric prostate magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in comparison with full multiparametric contrast material\u2013enhanced prostate MR imaging in men with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and negative transrectal ultrasonography (US)\u2013guided biopsy findings; to determine the significant cancer detection rate of biparametric versus full multiparametric contrast-enhanced MR imaging and between-reader agreement for interpretation of biparametric MR imaging. Materials and Methods In this institutional review board\u2013approved retrospective review of prospectively acquired data, men with PSA greater than or equal to 3 ng/mL after negative transrectal US-guided biopsy findings underwent state-of-the-art, full multiparametric contrast-enhanced MR imaging at 3.0-T including high-spatial-resolution structural imaging in several planes, diffusion-weighted imaging at 0, 800, 1000, and 1400 mm2/sec, and dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging, obtained without endorectal coil within 34 minutes 19 seconds. One of four radiologists with different levels of expertise (1\u20139 years) first reviewed only a fraction of the full multiparametric contrast-enhanced MR images, consisting of single-plane (axial) structural imaging (T2-weighted turbo spin-echo and diffusion-weighted imaging), acquired within 8 minutes 45 seconds (referred to as biparametric MR imaging), and established a diagnosis according to the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 2; only thereafter, the remaining full multiparametric contrast-enhanced MR images were read. Men with PI-RADS categories 3\u20135 underwent MR-guided targeted biopsy. Men with PI-RADS categories 1\u20132 remained in urologic follow-up for at least 2 years, with rebiopsy (transrectal US-guided or transperineal saturation) where appropriate. McNemar test was used to compare diagnostic accuracies. To investigate between-reader agreement, biparametric MR images of 100 patients were read independently by all three radiologists. Results A total of 542 men, aged 64.8 years \u00b1 8.2 (median PSA, 7 ng/mL), were included. Biparametric MR imaging helped detect clinically significant prostate cancer in 138 men. Full multiparametric contrast-enhanced MR imaging allowed detection of one additional clinically significant prostate cancer (a stage pT2a, intermediate-risk cancer with a Gleason score of 3+4) and caused 11 additional false-positive diagnoses. Diagnostic accuracy for detection of clinically significant cancer of biparametric MR imaging (89.1%, 483 of 542) was similar to that of full multiparametric contrast-enhanced MR imaging (87.2%, 473 of 542). Between-reader agreement of biparametric MR imaging interpretation was substantial (\u03ba = 0.81). Conclusion Biparametric MR imaging allows detection of clinically significant prostate cancer missed by transrectal US-guided biopsy. Biparametric prostate MR imaging takes less than 9 minutes examination time, works without contrast agent injection, and offers a diagnostic accuracy and cancer detection rate that are equivalent to those of conventional full multiparametric contrast-enhanced MR imaging protocols. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017",
        "Background Deep learning (DL)-based MRI reconstructions can reduce examination times for turbo spin-echo (TSE) acquisitions. Studies that prospectively employ DL-based reconstructions of rapidly acquired, undersampled spine MRI are needed. Purpose To investigate the diagnostic interchangeability of an unrolled DL-reconstructed TSE (hereafter, TSEDL) T1- and T2-weighted acquisition method with standard TSE and to test their impact on acquisition time, image quality, and diagnostic confidence. Materials and Methods This prospective single-center study included participants with various spinal abnormalities who gave written consent from November 2020 to July 2021. Each participant underwent two MRI examinations: standard fully sampled T1- and T2-weighted TSE acquisitions (reference standard) and prospectively undersampled TSEDL acquisitions with threefold and fourfold acceleration. Image evaluation was performed by five readers. Interchangeability analysis and an image quality-based analysis were used to compare the TSE and TSEDL images. Acquisition time and diagnostic confidence were also compared. Interchangeability was tested using the individual equivalence index regarding various degenerative and nondegenerative entities, which were analyzed on each vertebra and defined as discordant clinical judgments of less than 5%. Interreader and intrareader agreement and concordance (\u03ba and Kendall \u03c4 and W statistics) were computed and Wilcoxon and McNemar tests were used. Results Overall, 50 participants were evaluated (mean age, 46 years \u00b1 18 [SD]; 26 men). The TSEDL method enabled up to a 70% reduction in total acquisition time (100 seconds for TSEDL vs 328 seconds for TSE, P < .001). All individual equivalence indexes were less than 4%. TSEDL acquisition was rated as having superior image noise by all readers (P < .001). No evidence of a difference was found between standard TSE and TSEDL regarding frequency of major findings, overall image quality, or diagnostic confidence. Conclusion The deep learning (DL)-reconstructed turbo spin-echo (TSE) method was found to be interchangeable with standard TSE for detecting various abnormalities of the spine at MRI. DL-reconstructed TSE acquisition provided excellent image quality, with a 70% reduction in examination time. German Clinical Trials Register no.

        "Background The substantia nigra (SN) is suspected to be affected after remote infarction, in view of its large array of connections with the supratentorial brain. Whether secondary involvement of SN worsens overall clinical outcome after a supratentorial stroke has not previously been studied. Purpose To assess longitudinal changes in SN R2* by using MRI in the setting of ipsilesional supratentorial infarct and the relationship of SN signal change to clinical outcome. Materials and Methods Participants prospectively included from 2012 to 2015 were evaluated at 24-72 hours (baseline visit) and at 1 year with MRI to quantify R2*. The SN was segmented bilaterally to calculate an R2* asymmetry index (SN-AI); greater SN-AI indicated greater relative R2* in the ipsilateral compared with contralateral SN. The 95th percentile of R2* (hereafter, SN-AI95) was compared according to infarct location with mixed linear regression models. We also conducted voxel-based comparisons of R2* and identified individual infarcted voxels associated with high SN-AI95 through voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping. Multivariable regression models tested the association between SN-AI95 and clinical scores. Results A total of 181 participants were evaluated (127 men, 54 women; mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 64.2 years \u00b1 13.1; 75 striatum infarcts, 106 other locations). Visual inspection, SN-AI95, and average maps consistently showed higher SN R2* at 1 year if ipsilateral striatum was infarcted than if it was not (SN-AI95, 4.25 vs -0.88; P < .001), but this was not observed at baseline. The striatal location of the infarct was associated with higher SN-AI95 at 1 year independently from infarct volume, SN-AI95 at baseline, microbleeds, age, and sex (\u03b2 = 4.99; P < .001). Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping confirmed that striatum but also insula, internal capsule, and external capsule were associated with higher SN-AI95 at 1 year. SN-AI95 was an independent contributor of poor motor outcome (Box and Block Test, \u03b2 = -.62 points; P = .01). Conclusion In patients with stroke, greater substantia nigra R2*, likely reflective of greater iron content, can be observed at 1 year ipsilateral from remote infarcts of specific location, which is associated with worse motor function. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Purpose To assess adherence with annual or biennial screening mammography after a diagnosis of high-risk lesion(s) at stereotactic biopsy with or without surgical excision and to identify clinical factors that may affect screening adherence after a high-risk diagnosis. Materials and Methods This institutional review board-approved HIPAA-compliant retrospective study included 208 patients who underwent stereotactic biopsy between January 2012 and December 2014 that revealed a high-risk lesion. Whether the patient underwent surgical excision and/or follow-up mammography was documented. Adherence of these women to a protocol of subsequent mammography within 1 year (9-18 months) or within 2 years (9-30 months) was compared with that of 45 508 women with normal screening mammograms who were imaged during the same time period at the same institution. Possible factors relevant to postdiagnosis management and screening adherence were assessed. Consultation with a breast surgeon was identified by reviewing clinical notes. Uptake of pharmacologic chemoprevention following diagnosis (patient decision to take chemopreventive medications) was assessed. The Fisher exact test was used to compare annual or biennial screening adherence rates. Binary logistic regression was used to identify factors predictive of whether women returned for screening within selected time frames. Results In total, 913 (1.3%) of 67 874 women were given a recommendation to undergo stereotactic biopsy, resulting in diagnosis of 208 (22.8%) of 913 high-risk lesions. Excluding those with a prior personal history of breast cancer or upgrade to cancer at surgery, 124 (66.7%) of 186 women underwent surgery and 62 (33.3%) did not. Overall post-high-risk diagnosis adherence to annual or biennial mammography was similar to that in control subjects (annual, 56.4% vs 50.8%, P = .160; biennial, 62.0% vs 60.1%, P = .630). Adherence was significantly better in the surgical group than in the nonsurgical group for annual mammography (70.0% vs 32.0%; odds ratio [OR] = 5.0; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.4, 10.1; P < .001) and for biennial mammography (74.3% vs 40.0%; OR = 4.3; 95% CI: 2.1, 8.8; P < .001). Among the patients in the nonsurgical group, those adherent to annual or biennial mammography were significantly more likely to have seen a breast surgeon than the nonadherent women (annual, 77.3% vs 35.7%, P = .005; biennial, 67.9% vs 36.4%, P = .045). All patients receiving chemopreventive agents underwent a surgical consultation (100%; n = 21). Conclusion Although diagnosis of a high-risk lesion at stereotactic breast biopsy did not compromise overall adherence to subsequent mammographic screening, patients without surgical excision, particularly those who did not undergo a surgical consultation, had significantly lower imaging adherence and chemoprevention uptake as compared with their counterparts who underwent surgery, suggesting that specialist care may be important in optimizing management. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018.",
        "Purpose To develop and validate a deep learning-based automatic detection algorithm (DLAD) for malignant pulmonary nodules on chest radiographs and to compare its performance with physicians including thoracic radiologists. Materials and Methods For this retrospective study, DLAD was developed by using 43 292 chest radiographs (normal radiograph-to-nodule radiograph ratio, 34 067:9225) in 34 676 patients (healthy-to-nodule ratio, 30 784:3892; 19 230 men [mean age, 52.8 years; age range, 18-99 years]; 15 446 women [mean age, 52.3 years; age range, 18-98 years]) obtained between 2010 and 2015, which were labeled and partially annotated by 13 board-certified radiologists, in a convolutional neural network. Radiograph classification and nodule detection performances of DLAD were validated by using one internal and four external data sets from three South Korean hospitals and one U.S. hospital. For internal and external validation, radiograph classification and nodule detection performances of DLAD were evaluated by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and jackknife alternative free-response receiver-operating characteristic (JAFROC) figure of merit (FOM), respectively. An observer performance test involving 18 physicians, including nine board-certified radiologists, was conducted by using one of the four external validation data sets. Performances of DLAD, physicians, and physicians assisted with DLAD were evaluated and compared. Results According to one internal and four external validation data sets, radiograph classification and nodule detection performances of DLAD were a range of 0.92-0.99 (AUROC) and 0.831-0.924 (JAFROC FOM), respectively. DLAD showed a higher AUROC and JAFROC FOM at the observer performance test than 17 of 18 and 15 of 18 physicians, respectively (P < .05), and all physicians showed improved nodule detection performances with DLAD (mean JAFROC FOM improvement, 0.043; range, 0.006-0.190; P < .05). Conclusion This deep learning-based automatic detection algorithm outperformed physicians in radiograph classification and nodule detection performance for malignant pulmonary nodules on chest radiographs, and it enhanced physicians' performances when used as a second reader. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "BackgroundThe chest CT findings of patients with 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia have not previously been described in detail.PurposeTo investigate the clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings of emerging 2019-nCoV pneumonia in humans.Materials and MethodsFifty-one patients (25 men and 26 women; age range 16-76 years) with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction underwent thin-section CT. The imaging findings, clinical data, and laboratory data were evaluated.ResultsFifty of 51 patients (98%) had a history of contact with individuals from the endemic center in Wuhan, China. Fever (49 of 51, 96%) and cough (24 of 51, 47%) were the most common symptoms. Most patients had a normal white blood cell count (37 of 51, 73%), neutrophil count (44 of 51, 86%), and either normal (17 of 51, 35%) or reduced (33 of 51, 65%) lymphocyte count. CT images showed pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) in 39 of 51 (77%) patients and GGO with reticular and/or interlobular septal thickening in 38 of 51 (75%) patients. GGO with consolidation was present in 30 of 51 (59%) patients, and pure consolidation was present in 28 of 51 (55%) patients. Forty-four of 51 (86%) patients had bilateral lung involvement, while 41 of 51 (80%) involved the posterior part of the lungs and 44 of 51 (86%) were peripheral. There were more consolidated lung lesions in patients 5 days or more from disease onset to CT scan versus 4 days or fewer (431 of 712 lesions vs 129 of 612 lesions; P < .001). Patients older than 50 years had more consolidated lung lesions than did those aged 50 years or younger (212 of 470 vs 198 of 854; P < .001). Follow-up CT in 13 patients showed improvement in seven (54%) patients and progression in four (31%) patients.ConclusionPatients with fever and/or cough and with conspicuous ground-glass opacity lesions in the peripheral and posterior lungs on CT images, combined with normal or decreased white blood cells and a history of epidemic exposure, are highly suspected of having 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia.\u00a9 RSNA, 2020.",
        "Background Chest CT is used to assess the severity of lung involvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Purpose To determine the changes in chest CT findings associated with COVID-19 from initial diagnosis until patient recovery. Materials and Methods This retrospective review included patients with real-time polymerase chain reaction\u2013confirmed COVID-19 who presented between January 12, 2020, and February 6, 2020. Patients with severe respiratory distress and/or oxygen requirement at any time during the disease course were excluded. Repeat chest CT was performed at approximately 4-day intervals. Each of the five lung lobes was visually scored on a scale of 0 to 5, with 0 indicating no involvement and 5 indicating more than 75% involvement. The total CT score was determined as the sum of lung involvement, ranging from 0 (no involvement) to 25 (maximum involvement). Results Twenty-one patients (six men and 15 women aged 25\u201363 years) with confirmed COVID-19 were evaluated. A total of 82 chest CT scans were obtained in these patients, with a mean interval (\u00b1standard deviation) of 4 days \u00b1 1 (range, 1\u20138 days). All patients were discharged after a mean hospitalization period of 17 days \u00b1 4 (range, 11\u201326 days). Maximum lung involved peaked at approximately 10 days (with a calculated total CT score of 6) from the onset of initial symptoms (R2 = 0.25, P < .001). Based on quartiles of chest CT scans from day 0 to day 26 involvement, four stages of lung CT findings were defined. CT scans obtained in stage 1 (0\u20134 days) showed ground-glass opacities (18 of 24 scans [75%]), with a mean total CT score of 2 \u00b1 2; scans obtained in stage 2 (5\u20138 days) showed an increase in both the crazy-paving pattern (nine of 17 scans [53%]) and total CT score (mean, 6 \u00b1 4; P = .002); scans obtained in stage 3 (9\u201313 days) showed consolidation (19 of 21 scans [91%]) and a peak in the total CT score (mean, 7 \u00b1 4); and scans obtained in stage 4 (\u226514 days) showed gradual resolution of consolidation (15 of 20 scans [75%]) and a decrease in the total CT score (mean, 6 \u00b1 4) without crazy-paving pattern.

        "Background Previous studies suggest that use of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms as diagnostic aids may improve the quality of skeletal age assessment, though these studies lack evidence from clinical practice. Purpose To compare the accuracy and interpretation time of skeletal age assessment on hand radiograph examinations with and without the use of an AI algorithm as a diagnostic aid. Materials and Methods In this prospective randomized controlled trial, the accuracy of skeletal age assessment on hand radiograph examinations was performed with (n = 792) and without (n = 739) the AI algorithm as a diagnostic aid. For examinations with the AI algorithm, the radiologist was shown the AI interpretation as part of their routine clinical work and was permitted to accept or modify it. Hand radiographs were interpreted by 93 radiologists from six centers. The primary efficacy outcome was the mean absolute difference between the skeletal age dictated into the radiologists' signed report and the average interpretation of a panel of four radiologists not using a diagnostic aid. The secondary outcome was the interpretation time. A linear mixed-effects regression model with random center- and radiologist-level effects was used to compare the two experimental groups. Results Overall mean absolute difference was lower when radiologists used the AI algorithm compared with when they did not (5.36 months vs 5.95 months; P = .04). The proportions at which the absolute difference exceeded 12 months (9.3% vs 13.0%, P = .02) and 24 months (0.5% vs 1.8%, P = .02) were lower with the AI algorithm than without it. Median radiologist interpretation time was lower with the AI algorithm than without it (102 seconds vs 142 seconds, P = .001). Conclusion Use of an artificial intelligence algorithm improved skeletal age assessment accuracy and reduced interpretation times for radiologists, although differences were observed between centers.

        "Purpose To determine the prevalence of and risk factors for needlesticks in interventional radiology physicians, as well as the attitudes, behaviors, and conditions that promote or interfere with reporting of these injuries. Materials and Methods A total of 3889 interventional radiologists from academic and private practice in the United States were surveyed by emailing all interventional radiologist members of the Society of Interventional Radiology, including attending-level physicians and trainees (April-August 2016). The institutional review board waived the need for consent. Questions inquired about the nature, frequency, and type of needlestick and sharps injuries and whether and to whom these incidents were reported. Stepwise regression was used to determine variables predicting whether injuries were reported. Results In total, 908 (23%) interventional radiologists completed at least a portion of the survey. Eight hundred fourteen (91%) of 895 respondents reported a prior needlestick injury, 583 (35%) of 895 reported at least one injury while treating an HIV-positive patient, and 626 (71%) of 884 reported prior training regarding needlestick injury. There was, on average, one needlestick for every 5 years of practice. Most needlestick or sharps injuries were self inflicted (711 [87%] of 817) and involved a hollow-bore device (464 [56%] of 824). Only 566 (66%) of 850 injuries were reported. The most common reasons for not reporting included perceived lack of utility of reporting (79 [28%] of 282), perceived low risk for injury (56 [20%] of 282), noncontaminated needle (53 [19%] of 282), too-lengthy reporting process (37 [13%] of 282), and associated stigma (23 [8%] of 282). Only 156 (25%) of 624 respondents informed their significant other. Stepwise regression assessing variables affecting the likelihood of reporting showed that male sex (P = .009), low-risk patient (P < .0001), self injury (P = .010), trainee status (P < .0001), and the total number of prior injuries (P = .019) were independent predictors of not reporting.

        "Purpose To develop a positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance (MR) imaging protocol for evaluation of the brain, heart, and joints of pediatric cancer survivors for chemotherapy-induced injuries in one session. Materials and Methods Three teams of experts in neuroimaging, cardiac imaging, and bone imaging were tasked to develop a 20-30-minute PET/MR imaging protocol for detection of chemotherapy-induced tissue injuries of the brain, heart, and bone. In an institutional review board-approved, HIPAA-compliant, prospective study from April to July 2016, 10 pediatric cancer survivors who completed chemotherapy underwent imaging of the brain, heart, and bone with a 3-T PET/MR imager. Cumulative chemotherapy doses and clinical symptoms were correlated with the severity of MR imaging abnormalities by using linear regression analyses. MR imaging measures of brain perfusion and metabolism were compared among eight patients who were treated with methotrexate and eight untreated age-matched control subjects by using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Results Combined brain, heart, and bone examinations were completed within 90 minutes. Eight of 10 cancer survivors had abnormal findings on brain, heart, and bone images, including six patients with and two patients without clinical symptoms. Cumulative chemotherapy doses correlated significantly with MR imaging measures of left ventricular ejection fraction and end-systolic volume, but not with the severity of brain or bone abnormalities. Methotrexate-treated cancer survivors had significantly lower cerebral blood flow and metabolic activity in key brain areas compared with control subjects. Conclusion The feasibility of a single examination for assessment of chemotherapy-induced injuries of the brain, heart, and joints was shown. Earlier detection of tissue injuries may enable initiation of timely interventions and help to preserve long-term health of pediatric cancer survivors. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Background Although deep learning has brought revolutionary changes in health care, reliance on manually selected cross-sectional images and segmentation remain methodological barriers. Purpose To develop and validate an automated preoperative artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm for tumor and lymph node (LN) segmentation with CT imaging for prediction of LN metastasis in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, patients with surgically resected, pathologically confirmed PDAC underwent multidetector CT from January 2015 to April 2020. Three models were developed, including an AI model, a clinical model, and a radiomics model. CT-determined LN metastasis was diagnosed by radiologists. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to develop the clinical and radiomics models. The performance of the models was determined on the basis of their discrimination and clinical utility. Kaplan-Meier curves, the log-rank test, or Cox regression were used for survival analysis. Results Overall, 734 patients (mean age, 62 years \u00b1 9 [SD]; 453 men) were evaluated. All patients were split into training (n = 545) and validation (n = 189) sets. Patients who had LN metastasis (LN-positive group) accounted for 340 of 734 (46%) patients. In the training set, the AI model showed the highest performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.91) in the prediction of LN metastasis, whereas the radiologists and the clinical and radiomics models had AUCs of 0.58, 0.76, and 0.71, respectively. In the validation set, the AI model showed the highest performance (AUC, 0.92) in the prediction of LN metastasis, whereas the radiologists and the clinical and radiomics models had AUCs of 0.65, 0.77, and 0.68, respectively (P < .001). AI model-predicted positive LN metastasis was associated with worse survival (hazard ratio, 1.46; 95% CI: 1.13, 1.89; P = .004). Conclusion An artificial intelligence model outperformed radiologists and clinical and radiomics models for prediction of lymph node metastasis at CT in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. \u00a9 RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "History An 8-year-old girl presented to our hospital with painful swelling of the left thigh and soft-tissue swelling in the right chest wall. The patient\u2019s history revealed that the swelling had been present since birth but had grown slowly. She had no history of relevant trauma. Her blood pressure was 145/95 mmHg (normal value, <115/76 mmHg), and her heart rate was 105 beats per minute (normal value, 75\u2013118 beats per minute). The patient\u2019s electrocardiogram displayed sinus tachycardia. Physical examination revealed soft-tissue hypertrophy in the left thigh and right lower chest wall. A painful soft and flexible mass measuring approximately 5 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 15 cm (in the anteroposterior, transverse, and craniocaudal directions, respectively) was detected at the left thigh. Moreover, a painless soft mass measuring approximately 3 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 10 cm (in the anteroposterior, transverse, and craniocaudal directions, respectively) was detected in the right lower chest wall, and the overlying skin was intact. Pink macules with a 3-cm diameter on the anterior left superior thigh and a 2.5-cm diameter in the left inguinal region were detected. Examination of other systems, including the cardiovascular system, revealed normal findings. Laboratory test results were within normal limits. Abdominal US showed perirenal vascular collaterals, and musculoskeletal US of the left thigh revealed vascular collaterals (images not shown). Therefore, thoracoabdominal CT angiography (Fig 1a\u20131c) and contrast material\u2013enhanced MRI of the bilateral thigh (Fig 2a\u20132c) were performed.",
        "Background Spatial resolution, soft-tissue contrast, and dose-efficient capabilities of photon-counting CT (PCCT) potentially allow a better quality and diagnostic confidence of coronary CT angiography (CCTA) in comparison to conventional CT. Purpose To compare the quality of CCTA scans obtained with a clinical prototype PCCT system and an energy-integrating detector (EID) dual-layer CT (DLCT) system. Materials and Methods In this prospective board-approved study with informed consent, participants with coronary artery disease underwent retrospective electrocardiographically gated CCTA with both systems after injection of 65-75 mL of 400 mg/mL iodinated contrast agent at 5 mL/sec. A prior phantom task-based quality assessment of the detectability index of coronary lesions was performed. Ultra-high-resolution parameters were used for PCCT (1024 matrix, 0.25-mm section thickness) and EID DLCT (512 matrix, 0.67-mm section thickness). Three cardiac radiologists independently performed a blinded analysis using a five-point quality score (1 = insufficient, 5 = excellent) for overall image quality, diagnostic confidence, and diagnostic quality of calcifications, stents, and noncalcified plaques. A logistic regression model, adjusted for radiologists, was used to evaluate the proportion of improvement in scores with the best method. Results Fourteen consecutive participants (12 men; mean age, 61 years \u00b1 17) were enrolled. Scores of overall quality and diagnostic confidence were higher with PCCT images with a median of 5 (interquartile range [IQR], 2) and 5 (IQR, 1) versus 4 (IQR, 1) and 4 (IQR, 3) with EID DLCT images, using a mean tube current of 255 mAs \u00b1 0 versus 349 mAs \u00b1 111 for EID DLCT images (P < .01). Proportions of improvement with PCCT images for quality of calcification, stent, and noncalcified plaque were 100%, 92% (95% CI: 71, 98), and 45% (95% CI: 28, 63), respectively. In the phantom study, detectability indexes were 2.3-fold higher for lumen and 2.9-fold higher for noncalcified plaques with PCCT images. Conclusion Coronary CT angiography with a photon-counting CT system demonstrated in humans an improved image quality and diagnostic confidence compared with an energy-integrating dual-layer CT. \u00a9 RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Background The long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on pulmonary structure and function remain incompletely characterized. Purpose To test whether SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to small airways disease in patients with persistent symptoms. Materials and Methods In this single-center study at a university teaching hospital, adults with confirmed COVID-19 who remained symptomatic more than 30 days following diagnosis were prospectively enrolled from June to December 2020 and compared with healthy participants (controls) prospectively enrolled from March to August 2018. Participants with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) were classified as ambulatory, hospitalized, or having required the intensive care unit (ICU) based on the highest level of care received during acute infection. Symptoms, pulmonary function tests, and chest CT images were collected. Quantitative CT analysis was performed using supervised machine learning to measure regional ground-glass opacity (GGO) and using inspiratory and expiratory image-matching to measure regional air trapping. Univariable analyses and multivariable linear regression were used to compare groups. Results Overall, 100 participants with PASC (median age, 48 years; 66 women) were evaluated and compared with 106 matched healthy controls; 67% (67 of 100) of the participants with PASC were classified as ambulatory, 17% (17 of 100) were hospitalized, and 16% (16 of 100) required the ICU. In the hospitalized and ICU groups, the mean percentage of total lung classified as GGO was 13.2% and 28.7%, respectively, and was higher than that in the ambulatory group (3.7%, P < .001 for both comparisons). The mean percentage of total lung affected by air trapping was 25.4%, 34.6%, and 27.3% in the ambulatory, hospitalized, and ICU groups, respectively, and 7.2% in healthy controls (P < .001). Air trapping correlated with the residual volume\u2013to\u2013total lung capacity ratio (\u03c1 = 0.6, P < .001). Conclusion In survivors of COVID-19, small airways disease occurred independently of initial infection severity. The long-term consequences are unknown. \u00a9 RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article. See also the editorial by Elicker in this issue.",

        "Background A categorical CT assessment scheme for suspicion of pulmonary involvement of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19 provides a basis for gathering scientific evidence and improved communication with referring physicians. Purpose To introduce the COVID-19 Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS) for use in the standardized assessment of pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 on unenhanced chest CT images and to report its initial interobserver agreement and performance. Materials and Methods The Dutch Radiological Society developed CO-RADS based on other efforts for standardization, such as the Lung Imaging Reporting and Data System or Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System. CO-RADS assesses the suspicion for pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 on a scale from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high). The system is meant to be used in patients with moderate to severe symptoms of COVID-19. The system was evaluated by using 105 chest CT scans of patients admitted to the hospital with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 and in whom reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed (mean, 62 years \u00b1 16 [standard deviation]; 61 men, 53 with positive RT-PCR results). Eight observers used CO-RADS to assess the scans. Fleiss \u03ba value was calculated, and scores of individual observers were compared with the median of the remaining seven observers. The resulting area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) was compared with results from RT-PCR and clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Results There was absolute agreement among observers in 573 (68.2%) of 840 observations. Fleiss \u03ba value was 0.47 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.45, 0.47), with the highest \u03ba value for CO-RADS categories 1 (0.58, 95% CI: 0.54, 0.62) and 5 (0.68, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.72). The average AUC was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.97) for predicting RT-PCR outcome and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.91, 0.99) for clinical diagnosis. The false-negative rate for CO-RADS 1 was nine of 161 cases (5.6%; 95% CI: 1.0%, 10%), and the false-positive rate for CO-RADS category 5 was one of 286 (0.3%; 95% CI: 0%, 1.0%). Conclusion The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS) is a categorical assessment scheme for pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 at unenhanced chest CT that performs very well in predicting COVID-19 in patients with moderate to severe symptoms and has substantial interobserver agreement, especially for categories 1 and 5. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020",
        "Purpose To evaluate whether patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)\u2014a multisystem neurodevelopmental disorder with myriad imaging manifestations, including focal transient myelin vacuolization within the deep gray nuclei, brainstem, and cerebellum\u2014exhibit differences in cortical and subcortical structures, particularly in subcortical regions where these abnormalities manifest. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, by using clinically obtained three-dimensional T1-weighted MR images and established image analysis methods, 10 intracranial volume\u2013corrected subcortical and 34 cortical regions of interest (ROIs) were quantitatively assessed in 32 patients with NF1 and 245 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. By using linear models, ROI cortical thicknesses and volumes were compared between patients with NF1 and control subjects, as a function of age. With hierarchic cluster analysis and partial correlations, differences in the pattern of association between cortical and subcortical ROI volumes in patients with NF1 and control subjects were also evaluated. Results Patients with NF1 exhibited larger subcortical volumes and thicker cortices of select regions, particularly the hippocampi, amygdalae, cerebellar white matter, ventral diencephalon, thalami, and occipital cortices. For the thalami and pallida and 22 cortical ROIs in patients with NF1, a significant inverse association between volume and age was found, suggesting that volumes decrease with increasing age. Moreover, compared with those in control subjects, ROIs in patients with NF1 exhibited a distinct pattern of clustering and partial correlations. Discussion Neurofibromatosis type 1 is characterized by larger subcortical volumes and thicker cortices of select structures. Most apparent within the hippocampi, amygdalae, cerebellar white matter, ventral diencephalon, thalami and occipital cortices, these neurofibromatosis type 1\u2013associated volumetric changes may, in part, be age dependent. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "History A 54-year-old man was found by paramedics in his home face-down at his computer desk with a substantially reduced level of consciousness. He had not contacted his family for more than 50 hours. The patient lived alone and was a heavy smoker with a history of alcohol abuse. His medical history was otherwise unremarkable, and there was no history of cancer, psoriasis, or rheumatoid arthritis, nor was there a history of methotrexate administration. On presentation to the emergency department, he was mildly hypotensive and was experiencing hypercapnic respiratory failure and acute renal failure with rhabdomyolysis. His toxicology screen was mildly positive for opiates. He received naloxone (Narcan; Emergent) with minimal effect. An unenhanced CT scan of the head was obtained (Fig 1A). Of note, this patient's presentation predated the COVID-19 pandemic. He was admitted to the intensive care unit for decreased level of consciousness and respiratory failure. The decreased level of consciousness was thought to be secondary to seizure, as he developed seizurelike movements prior to intubation, probably in the context of intoxication or alcohol withdrawal. Electroencephalography revealed moderate bilateral cerebral dysfunction and encephalopathy, with no evidence of nonconvulsive seizures. He had a short course of intermittent hemodialysis and was discharged home 8 days later with an appointment for neurology follow-up. At discharge, he was at his cognitive and functional baseline. Approximately 3 weeks later, the patient was brought back to the emergency department for progressive confusion and decrease in balance. He became apathetic with reduced psychomotor activity and was no longer able to perform basic daily activities, such as cooking or bathing. He displayed bizarre behavior, such as staring at a wall for hours, and was somnolent, irritable, and inattentive. He eventually became incontinent of urine and stool. Results of a neurologic examination of the cranial nerves, motor function, sensation, and reflexes were normal. The results of blood work-up were grossly normal, and the results of an extensive toxicology work-up were negative. Repeat head CT was performed (Fig 1B). MRI was ordered to further investigate the patient's encephalopathic presentation (Figs 2-3).",
        "History A 92-year-old bedridden woman presented to the emergency department from an assisted living facility with fever, cough, and swelling over the right lateral hip. She had baseline dementia and frailty and had been bedridden for 4 years. She did not have any recent falls or history of trauma at the site of swelling. She had a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that had been diagnosed and treated 7 years ago, and thoracoabdominal CT at last follow-up 3 years ago did not show any recurrence. Physical examination findings were unremarkable except for a painful hard and fixed mass measuring approximately 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 10 cm (in the transverse, anteroposterior, and craniocaudal directions, respectively) located at the right lateral superior thigh. The overlying skin was intact, without any color changes. Pertinent blood test results showed an increased white blood cell count of 13 000/\u03bcL (13 \u00d7109/L) (normal range, 3700-11 000/\u03bcL [3.7-11 \u00d7109/L]). The remaining hematologic and biochemical test results were normal. Abdominal and pelvic CT performed at presentation did not show any abnormal lymph nodes. Because chest radiography showed consolidation in addition to typical clinical picture, the patient was diagnosed with pneumonia and underwent antibiotic treatment for 3 weeks. US ( Fig 1 ) and Doppler US ( Fig 2 ) of the mass were performed. MRI was not performed because the patient had a pacemaker; instead, CT of the lower extremity was performed ( Fig 3a , 3b ).

        "Background Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the recommended treatment for intermediate hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer guidelines. Prospective uncontrolled studies suggest that yttrium 90 (90Y) transarterial radioembolization (TARE) is a safe and effective alternative. Purpose To compare the efficacy and safety of TARE with TACE for unresectable HCC. Materials and Methods In this single-center prospective randomized controlled trial (TRACE), 90Y glass TARE was compared with doxorubicin drug-eluting bead (DEB) TACE in participants with intermediate-stage HCC, extended to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 1 and those with early-stage HCC not eligible for surgery or thermoablation. Participants were recruited between September 2011 and March 2018. The primary end point was time to overall tumor progression (TTP) (Kaplan-Meier analysis) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) groups. Results At interim analysis, 38 participants (median age, 67 years; IQR, 63-72 years; 33 men) were randomized to the TARE arm and 34 (median age, 68 years; IQR, 61-71 years; 30 men) to the DEB-TACE arm (ITT group). Median TTP was 17.1 months in the TARE arm versus 9.5 months in the DEB-TACE arm (ITT group hazard ratio [HR], 0.36; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.70; P = .002) (PP group, 32 and 34 participants, respectively, in each arm; HR, 0.29; 95% CI: 0.14, 0.60; P < .001). Median overall survival was 30.2 months after TARE and 15.6 months after DEB-TACE (ITT group HR, 0.48; 95% CI: 0.28, 0.82; P = .006). Serious adverse events grade 3 or higher (13 of 33 participants [39%] vs 19 of 36 [53%] after TARE and DEB-TACE, respectively; P = .47) and 30-day mortality (0 of 33 participants [0%] vs three of 36 [8.3%]; P = .24) were similar in the safety groups. At the interim, the HR for the primary end point, TTP, was less than 0.39, meeting the criteria to halt the study. Conclusion With similar safety profile, yttrium 90 radioembolization conferred superior tumor control and survival compared with chemoembolization using drug-eluting beads in selected participants with early or intermediate hepatocellular carcinoma.

        "Background Use of artificial intelligence (AI) as a stand-alone reader for digital mammography (DM) or digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) breast screening could ease radiologists' workload while maintaining quality. Purpose To retrospectively evaluate the stand-alone performance of an AI system as an independent reader of DM and DBT screening examinations. Materials and Methods Consecutive screening-paired and independently read DM and DBT images acquired between January 2015 and December 2016 were retrospectively collected from the Tomosynthesis Cordoba Screening Trial. An AI system computed a cancer risk score (range, 1\u2013100) for DM and DBT examinations independently. AI stand-alone performance was measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and sensitivity and recall rate at different operating points selected to have noninferior sensitivity compared with the human readings (noninferiority margin, 5%). The recall rate of AI and the human readings were compared using a McNemar test. Results A total of 15 999 DM and DBT examinations (113 breast cancers, including 98 screen-detected and 15 interval cancers) from 15 998 women (mean age, 58 years \u00b1 6 [standard deviation]) were evaluated. AI achieved an AUC of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.89, 0.96) for DM and 0.94 (95% CI: 0.91, 0.97) for DBT. For DM, AI achieved noninferior sensitivity as a single (58.4%; 66 of 113; 95% CI: 49.2, 67.1) or double (67.3%; 76 of 113; 95% CI: 58.2, 75.2) reader, with a reduction in recall rate (P < .001) of up to 2% (95% CI: \u22122.4, \u22121.6). For DBT, AI achieved noninferior sensitivity as a single (77%; 87 of 113; 95% CI: 68.4, 83.8) or double (81.4%; 92 of 113; 95% CI: 73.3, 87.5) reader, but with a higher recall rate (P < .001) of up to 12.3% (95% CI: 11.7, 12.9). Conclusion Artificial intelligence could replace radiologists' readings in breast screening, achieving a noninferior sensitivity, with a lower recall rate for digital mammography but a higher recall rate for digital breast tomosynthesis.

        "Background X-ray dark-field radiography takes advantage of the wave properties of x-rays, with a relatively high signal in the lungs due to the many air-tissue interfaces in the alveoli. Purpose To describe the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of x-ray dark-field images in healthy human subjects. Materials and Methods Between October 2018 and January 2020, patients of legal age who underwent chest CT as part of their diagnostic work-up were screened for study participation. Inclusion criteria were a normal chest CT scan, the ability to consent, and the ability to stand upright without help. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, serious medical conditions, and changes in the lung tissue, such as those due to cancer, pleural effusion, atelectasis, emphysema, infiltrates, ground-glass opacities, or pneumothorax. Images of study participants were obtained by using a clinical x-ray dark-field prototype, recently constructed and commissioned at the authors' institution, to simultaneously acquire both attenuation-based and dark-field thorax radiographs. Each subject's total dark-field signal was correlated with his or her lung volume, and the dark-field coefficient was correlated with age, sex, weight, and height. Results Overall, 40 subjects were included in this study (average age, 62 years \u00b1 13 [standard deviation]; 26 men, 14 women). Normal human lungs have high signal, while the surrounding osseous structures and soft tissue have very low and no signal, respectively. The average dark-field signal was 2.5 m-1 \u00b1 0.4 of examined lung tissue. There was a correlation between the total dark-field signal and the lung volume (r = 0.61, P < .001). No difference was found between men and women (P = .78). Also, age (r = -0.18, P = .26), weight (r = 0.24, P = .13), and height (r = 0.01, P = .96) did not influence dark-field signal. Conclusion This study introduces qualitative and quantitative values for x-ray dark-field imaging in healthy human subjects. The quantitative x-ray dark-field coefficient is independent from demographic subject parameters, emphasizing its potential in diagnostic assessment of the lung. \u00a9RSNA, 2021 See also the editorial by Hatabu and Madore in this issue.",

        "Purpose To evaluate the effect of middle meningeal artery (MMA) embolization on chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) and compare the treatment outcomes of MMA embolization and conventional treatment. Materials and Methods All consecutive patients 20 years or older with CSDH were assessed for eligibility. CSDHs with a focal location, a thickness of 10 mm or less, no mass effect, or underlying conditions were excluded. Seventy-two prospectively enrolled patients with CSDH underwent MMA embolization (embolization group; as the sole treatment in 27 [37.5%] asymptomatic patients and with additional hematoma removal for symptom relief in 45 [62.5%] symptomatic patients). For comparison, 469 patients who underwent conventional treatment were included as a historical control group (conventional treatment group; close, nonsurgical follow-up in 67 [14.3%] and hematoma removal in 402 [85.7%] patients). Primary outcome was treatment failure defined as a composite of incomplete hematoma resolution (remaining or reaccumulated hematoma with thickness > 10 mm) or surgical rescue (hematoma removal for relief of symptoms that developed with continuous growth of initial or reaccumulated hematoma). Secondary outcomes included surgical rescue as a component of the primary outcome and treatment-related complication for safety measure. Six-month outcomes were compared between the study groups with logistic regression analysis. Results Spontaneous hematoma resolution was achieved in all of 27 asymptomatic patients undergoing embolization without direct hematoma removal. Hematoma reaccumulation occurred in one (2.2%) of 45 symptomatic patients receiving embolization with additional hematoma removal. Treatment failure rate in the embolization group was lower than in the conventional treatment group (one of 72 patients [1.4%] vs 129 of 469 patients [27.5%], respectively; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.056; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.011, 0.286; P = .001). Surgical rescue was less frequent in the embolization group (one of 72 patients [1.4%] vs 88 of 469 patients [18.8%]; adjusted OR, 0.094; 95% CI: 0.018, 0.488; P = .005). Treatment-related complication rate was not different between the two groups (0 of 72 patients vs 20 of 469 patients [4.3%]; adjusted OR, 0.145; 95% CI: 0.009, 2.469; P = .182). Conclusion MMA embolization has a positive therapeutic effect on CSDH and is more effective than conventional treatment. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017",
        "Background Corticosteroids injected for the treatment of musculoskeletal pain are systemically absorbed and can affect the immune response to viral infections. Purpose To determine the incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 disease in individuals receiving image-guided corticosteroid injections for musculoskeletal pain compared with the general population during the pandemic recovery period. Materials and Methods In this prospective cohort multicenter study, adults with a history of musculoskeletal pain who underwent imaging-guided intra-articular and spine corticosteroid injections from April 2020 to February 2021 were consecutively enrolled. Participants were followed for a minimum of 28 days through their electronic medical record (EMR) or by direct phone communication to screen for COVID-19 test results or symptoms. Clinical data, including body mass index (BMI), were also obtained from the EMR. The incidence of COVID-19 in the state was obtained using the Massachusetts COVID-19 Response Reporting website. The Student t test was used for continuous variable comparisons. Univariable analyses were performed using the Fisher exact test. Results A total of 2714 corticosteroid injections were performed in 2190 adult participants (mean age, 59 years \u00b1 15 [SD]; 1031 women). Follow-up was available for 1960 participants (89%) who received 2484 injections. Follow-up occurred a mean of 97 days \u00b1 33 (range, 28-141 days) after the injection. Of the 1960 participants, 10 had COVID-19 within 28 days from the injection (0.5% [95% CI: 0.24, 0.94]) and 43 had COVID-19 up to 4 months after the injection (2.2% [95% CI: 1.6, 2.9]). These incidence rates were lower than that of the population of Massachusetts during the same period (519 195 of 6 892 503 [7.5%], P < .001 for both 28 days and 4 months). Participants diagnosed with COVID-19 (n = 10) within 28 days from the injection had a higher BMI than the entire cohort (n = 1960) (mean, 32 kg/m2 \u00b1 10 vs 28 kg/m2 \u00b1 6; P = .04).

This was tested in patients with bladder and lung cancer (cohorts 2 and 3). Radiomics variables were extracted from all metastases delineated at pretreatment CT and selected by using an elastic-net model. A regression model combined radiomics and clinical variables with response as the end point. Biologic validation of the radiomics score with RNA profiling of cytotoxic cells (cohort 4) was assessed with Mann-Whitney analysis. Results The radiomics signature was developed in 85 patients (cohort 1: mean age, 58 years \u00b1 13 [standard deviation]; 43 men) and tested on 46 patients (cohort 2: mean age, 70 years \u00b1 12; 37 men) and 47 patients (cohort 3: mean age, 64 years \u00b1 11; 40 men). Biologic validation was performed in a further cohort of 20 patients (cohort 4: mean age, 60 years \u00b1 13; 14 men). The radiomics signature was associated with clinical response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (area under the curve [AUC], 0.70; 95% CI: 0.64, 0.77; P < .001). In cohorts 2 and 3, the AUC was 0.67 (95% CI: 0.58, 0.76) and 0.67 (95% CI: 0.56, 0.77; P < .001), respectively. A radiomics-clinical signature (including baseline albumin level and lymphocyte count) improved on radiomics-only performance (AUC, 0.74 [95% CI: 0.63, 0.84; P < .001]; Akaike information criterion, 107.00 and 109.90, respectively). Conclusion A pretreatment CT-based radiomics signature is associated with response to immune checkpoint inhibitors, likely reflecting the tumor immunophenotype. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Purpose To investigate the utility and accuracy of breast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging as a supplemental screening tool in women at average risk for breast cancer and to investigate the types of cancer detected with MR imaging screening. Materials and Methods This prospective observational study was conducted at two academic breast centers in women aged 40-70 years without breast cancer-associated risk factors (lifetime risk <15%). Between January 2005 and December 2013, women with at least minimal residual breast tissue (American College of Radiology categories A-D) and normal conventional imaging findings (screening mammography with or without screening ultrasonography [US]) were invited to undergo supplemental MR imaging screening. Outcome measures were supplemental cancer detection rates, interval cancer rates, and biologic profiles of MR imaging-detected additional cancers, as well as specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) of MR imaging screening. Tissue diagnoses or 2 years of follow-up were used to establish the reference standard. Results A total of 2120 women were recruited and underwent 3861 screening MR imaging studies, covering an observation period of 7007 women-years. Breast MR imaging depicted 60 additional breast cancers (ductal carcinoma in situ, n = 20; invasive carcinoma, n = 40) for an overall supplemental cancer detection rate of 15.5 per 1000 cases (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.9, 20.0). Forty-eight additional cancers were detected with MR imaging at initial screening (supplemental cancer detection rate, 22.6 per 1000 cases). During the 1741 subsequent screening rounds, 12 of 13 incident cancers were found with MR imaging alone (supplemental cancer detection rate, 6.9 per 1000 cases). One cancer was diagnosed with all three methods (mammography, US, and MR imaging), and none were diagnosed with mammography only or US only. Cancers diagnosed with MR imaging were small (median, 8 mm), node negative in 93.4% of cases, and dedifferentiated (high-grade cancer) in 41.7% of cases at prevalence screening and 46.0% of cases at incidence screening. No interval cancers were observed. MR imaging screening offered high specificity (97.1%; 95% CI: 96.5, 97.6) and high PPV (35.7%; 95% CI: 28.9, 43.1). Conclusion In women at average risk for breast cancer, MR imaging screening improves early diagnosis of prognostically relevant breast cancer. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pneumonia of other diseases share similar CT characteristics, which contributes to the challenges in differentiating them with high accuracy. Purpose To establish and evaluate an artificial intelligence (AI) system for differentiating COVID-19 and other pneumonia at chest CT and assessing radiologist performance without and with AI assistance. Materials and Methods A total of 521 patients with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction results for COVID-19 and abnormal chest CT findings were retrospectively identified from 10 hospitals from January 2020 to April 2020. A total of 665 patients with non\u2013COVID-19 pneumonia and definite evidence of pneumonia at chest CT were retrospectively selected from three hospitals between 2017 and 2019. To classify COVID-19 versus other pneumonia for each patient, abnormal CT slices were input into the EfficientNet B4 deep neural network architecture after lung segmentation, followed by a two-layer fully connected neural network to pool slices together. The final cohort of 1186 patients (132 583 CT slices) was divided into training, validation, and test sets in a 7:2:1 and equal ratio. Independent testing was performed by evaluating model performance in separate hospitals. Studies were blindly reviewed by six radiologists without and then with AI assistance. Results The final model achieved a test accuracy of 96% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 90%, 98%), a sensitivity of 95% (95% CI: 83%, 100%), and a specificity of 96% (95% CI: 88%, 99%) with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95 and area under the precision-recall curve of 0.90. On independent testing, this model achieved an accuracy of 87% (95% CI: 82%, 90%), a sensitivity of 89% (95% CI: 81%, 94%), and a specificity of 86% (95% CI: 80%, 90%) with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.90 and area under the precision-recall curve of 0.87. Assisted by the probabilities of the model, the radiologists achieved a higher average test accuracy (90% vs 85%, \u0394 = 5, P < .001), sensitivity (88% vs 79%, \u0394 = 9, P < .001), and specificity (91% vs 88%, \u0394 = 3, P = .001). Conclusion Artificial intelligence assistance improved radiologists' performance in distinguishing coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia from non\u2013coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia at chest CT. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "A 45-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with acute worsening of prolonged unexplained nausea, nonbilious vomiting, and mild upper abdominal pain of 4 years duration. Her bowel habits were regular, and there was no history of diarrhea or fresh or altered blood in her stool. On further inquiry, there was no history of facial flushing, excessive diaphoresis, or asthmalike symptoms. Her history was unrevealing; in particular, there was no history of known malignancy. On clinical examination, her vital signs were stable. The abdomen was soft, with no focal tenderness or palpable mass. Routine blood investigations, including complete blood counts, and liver, kidney, and thyroid function tests yielded results that were within normal limits. Her 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and chromogranin A levels were not elevated. Initial evaluation with contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed. Subsequently, an indium 111 octreotide scan was performed at the recommendation of the radiologist 1 month after CT (Figs 1, 2).",

        "BACKGROUND: Head injury is trauma to the head with or without injury to the brain. The incidence is on the increase due to the rapid growth in infrastructure, politics and interpersonal violence. The incidence of head injury is higher among young adults who constitute the most active and productive in any society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAIM AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to determine the computed tomographic findings as well as the correlation between CT findings with the severity of the head injury using GCS.MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a prospective cross sectional study on 231 adult patients who had CT scan of the head following trauma from August 2014 to August 2015. A GE 4 slices Bright speed spiral CT machine was used for the study.RESULTS: Road traffic accident accounted for 90% of the causes of head injury in this study and the most affected age group was 21-30 years with an overall mean age and SD of 38.12 \u00b1 13.58 years. Midline shift of \u2265 5mm showed statistically significant relationship with severity of head injury, P < 0.001. There was positive correlation between CT findings with severity of head injury using GCS.CONCLUSION: Road traffic accident plays a major role as cause of head injury in our society.GCS and CT scan are useful in the evaluation of head injured patients.KEY WORDS: Head injury, computed tomography, Glasgow coma score.",
        "Purpose To compare the diagnostic yield and complication rates of electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopic (ENB)-guided and computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous tissue sampling of lung nodules. Materials and Methods Retrospectively identified were 149 patients sampled percutaneously with CT guidance and 146 patients who underwent ENB with transbronchial biopsy of a lung lesion between 2013 and 2015. Clinical data, incidence of complications, and nodule pathologic analyses were assessed through electronic medical record review. Lung nodule characteristics were reviewed through direct image analysis. Molecular marker studies and pathologic analyses from surgical excision were reviewed when available. Multiple-variable logistic regression models were built to compare the diagnostic yield and complication rates for each method and for different patient and disease characteristics. Results CT-guided sampling was more likely to be diagnostic than ENB-guided biopsy (86.0% [129 of 150] vs 66.0% [99 of 150], respectively), and this difference remained significant even after adjustments were made for patient and nodule characteristics (P < .001). Age, American Society of Anesthesiologists class, emphysema grade, nodule size, and distance from pleura were not significant predictors of increased diagnostic yield. Intraprocedural time for physicians was significantly lower with CT-guided sampling (P < .001). Similar yield for molecular analyses was noted with the two approaches (ENB-guided sampling, 88.9% [32 of 36]; CT-guided sampling, 82.0% [41 of 50]). The two groups had similar rates of major complications (symptomatic hemorrhage, P > .999; pneumothorax requiring chest tube and/or admission, P = .417). Conclusion CT-guided transthoracic biopsy provided higher diagnostic yield in the assessment of peripheral pulmonary nodules than navigational bronchoscopy with a similar rate of clinically relevant complications. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "nucleic acid assay was also negative at this time.Six days after admission, the third RT-PCR 2019-nCoV nucleic acid assay was finally found to be positive.When specimen tests are negative, the possibility of a false-negative result should be considered in the context of a patient's recent exposures and the presence of clinical signs and symptoms consistent with 2019-nCoV infection (1,2).In this case, chest CT findings were typical of findings for 2019-nCoV pneumonia (3) coupled with recent exposure suggesting that 2019-nCoV infection was likely.Disclosures of Conflicts of Interest: P.H. disclosed no relevant relationships.T.L. disclosed no relevant relationships.L.",
        "Background Little is known about the long-term lung radiographic changes in patients who have recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), especially those with severe disease. Purpose To prospectively assess pulmonary sequelae and explore the risk factors for fibrotic-like changes in the lung at 6-month follow-up chest CT of survivors of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Materials and Methods A total of 114 patients (80 [70%] men; mean age, 54 years \u00b1 12) were studied prospectively. Initial and follow-up CT scans were obtained a mean of 17 days \u00b1 11 and 175 days \u00b1 20, respectively, after symptom onset. Lung changes (opacification, consolidation, reticulation, and fibrotic-like changes) and CT extent scores (score per lobe, 0\u20135; maximum score, 25) were recorded. Participants were divided into two groups on the basis of their 6-month follow-up CT scan: those with CT evidence of fibrotic-like changes (traction bronchiectasis, parenchymal bands, and/or honeycombing) (group 1) and those without CT evidence of fibrotic-like changes (group 2). Between-group differences were assessed with the Fisher exact test, two-sample t test, or Mann-Whitney U test. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the independent predictive factors of fibrotic-like changes. Results At follow-up CT, evidence of fibrotic-like changes was observed in 40 of the 114 participants (35%) (group 1), whereas the remaining 74 participants (65%) showed either complete radiologic resolution (43 of 114, 38%) or residual ground-glass opacification or interstitial thickening (31 of 114, 27%) (group 2). Multivariable analysis identified age of greater than 50 years (odds ratio [OR]: 8.5; 95% CI: 1.9, 38; P = .01), heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute at admission (OR: 5.6; 95% CI: 1.1, 29; P = .04), duration of hospital stay greater than or equal to 17 days (OR: 5.5; 95% CI: 1.5, 21; P = .01), acute respiratory distress syndrome (OR: 13; 95% CI: 3.3, 55; P < .001), noninvasive mechanical ventilation (OR: 6.3; 95% CI: 1.3, 30; P = .02), and total CT score of 18 or more (OR: 4.2; 95% CI: 1.2, 14; P = .02) at initial CT as independent predictors for fibrotic-like changes in the lung at 6 months. Conclusion Six-month follow-up CT showed fibrotic-like changes in the lung in more than one-third of patients who survived severe coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia. These changes were associated with an older age, acute respiratory distress syndrome, longer hospital stays, tachycardia, noninvasive mechanical ventilation, and higher initial chest CT score. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Purpose To develop and evaluate a supportive algorithm using deep learning for detecting cerebral aneurysms at time-of-flight MR angiography to provide a second assessment of images already interpreted by radiologists. Materials and Methods MR images reported by radiologists to contain aneurysms were extracted from four institutions for the period from November 2006 through October 2017. The images were divided into three data sets: training data set, internal test data set, and external test data set. The algorithm was constructed by deep learning with the training data set, and its sensitivity to detect aneurysms in the test data sets was evaluated. To find aneurysms that had been overlooked in the initial reports, two radiologists independently performed a blinded interpretation of aneurysm candidates detected by the algorithm. When there was disagreement, the final diagnosis was made in consensus. The number of newly detected aneurysms was also evaluated. Results The training data set, which provided training and validation data, included 748 aneurysms (mean size, 3.1 mm \u00b1 2.0 [standard deviation]) from 683 examinations; 318 of these examinations were on male patients (mean age, 63 years \u00b1 13) and 365 were on female patients (mean age, 64 years \u00b1 13). Test data were provided by the internal test data set (649 aneurysms [mean size, 4.1 mm \u00b1 3.2] in 521 examinations, including 177 male patients and 344 female patients with mean age of 66 years \u00b1 12 and 67 years \u00b1 13, respectively) and the external test data set (80 aneurysms [mean size, 4.1 mm \u00b1 2.1] in 67 examinations, including 19 male patients and 48 female patients with mean age of 63 years \u00b1 12 and 68 years \u00b1 12, respectively). The sensitivity was 91% (592 of 649) and 93% (74 of 80) for the internal and external test data sets, respectively. The algorithm improved aneurysm detection in the internal and external test data sets by 4.8% (31 of 649) and 13% (10 of 80), respectively, compared with the initial reports. Conclusion A deep learning algorithm detected cerebral aneurysms in radiologic reports with high sensitivity and improved aneurysm detection compared with the initial reports. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 See also the editorial by Flanders in this issue.",
        "History A 37-year-old man from the United States presented with a 1-year history of neck pain and stiffness that had been unsuccessfully treated with manipulative therapy by a chiropractor at another institution. Past medical history was remarkable only for marijuana and air duster abuse. He denied use of any prescription medications. Physical examination was notable for markedly reduced range of motion of the cervical spine. Laboratory work-up revealed an elevated alkaline phosphatase level (302 U/L [5.0 \u03bckat/L]; normal range, 40\u2013100 U/L [0.7\u20131.67 \u03bckat/L]), but all other laboratory findings, including complete blood count, renal function, liver function, vitamin A level, serum protein electrophoresis, and hepatitis C antibodies were within normal limits. Cervical spine radiography was performed, followed by MRI. Subsequently, a full skeletal survey was ordered. Included are representative radiographs of the pelvis, left forearm, and distal right leg with ankle.",
        "Purpose To develop and evaluate a fully automated algorithm for segmenting the abdomen from CT to quantify body composition. Materials and Methods For this retrospective study, a convolutional neural network based on the U-Net architecture was trained to perform abdominal segmentation on a data set of 2430 two-dimensional CT examinations and was tested on 270 CT examinations. It was further tested on a separate data set of 2369 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). CT examinations were performed between 1997 and 2015. The mean age of patients was 67 years; for male patients, it was 67 years (range, 29-94 years), and for female patients, it was 66 years (range, 31-97 years). Differences in segmentation performance were assessed by using two-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction. Results Compared with reference segmentation, the model for this study achieved Dice scores (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) of 0.98 \u00b1 0.03, 0.96 \u00b1 0.02, and 0.97 \u00b1 0.01 in the test set, and 0.94 \u00b1 0.05, 0.92 \u00b1 0.04, and 0.98 \u00b1 0.02 in the HCC data set, for the subcutaneous, muscle, and visceral adipose tissue compartments, respectively. Performance met or exceeded that of expert manual segmentation. Conclusion Model performance met or exceeded the accuracy of expert manual segmentation of CT examinations for both the test data set and the hepatocellular carcinoma data set. The model generalized well to multiple levels of the abdomen and may be capable of fully automated quantification of body composition metrics in three-dimensional CT examinations. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.
