        "Mexico implemented a 1 peso per liter excise tax on sugar-sweetened beverages on January 1, 2014, and a previous study found a 6 percent reduction in purchases of taxed beverages in 2014. In this study we estimated changes in beverage purchases for 2014 and 2015. We used store purchase data for 6,645 households from January 2012 to December 2015. Changes in purchases of taxed and untaxed beverages in the study period were estimated using two models, which compared 2014 and 2015 purchases with predicted (counterfactual) purchases based on trends in 2012\u201313. Purchases of taxed beverages decreased 5.5 percent in 2014 and 9.7 percent in 2015, yielding an average reduction of 7.6 percent over the study period. Households at the lowest socioeconomic level had the largest decreases in purchases of taxed beverages in both years. Purchases of untaxed beverage increased 2.1 percent in the study period. Findings from Mexico may encourage other countries to use fiscal policies to reduce consumption of unhealthy beverages along with other interventions to reduce the burden of chronic disease.",
        "The use of direct-to-consumer telehealth, in which a patient has access to a physician via telephone or videoconferencing, is growing rapidly. A key attraction of this type of telehealth for health plans and employers is the potential savings involved in replacing physician office and emergency department visits with less expensive virtual visits. However, increased convenience may tap into unmet demand for health care, and new utilization may increase overall health care spending. We used commercial claims data on over 300,000 patients from three years (2011\u201313) to explore patterns of utilization and spending for acute respiratory illnesses. We estimated that 12 percent of direct-to-consumer telehealth visits replaced visits to other providers, and 88 percent represented new utilization. Net annual spending on acute respiratory illness increased $45 per telehealth user. Direct-to-consumer telehealth may increase access by making care more convenient for certain patients, but it may also increase utilization and health care spending.",
        "Patient portals that provide secure online access to medical record information and provider communication can improve health care. Yet new technologies can exacerbate existing disparities. We analyzed information about 2,325 insured respondents to the nationally representative 2017 Health Information National Trends Survey to examine characteristics of portal nonusers and reasons for nonuse. Sixty-three percent reported not using a portal during the prior year. In multivariable analysis, we found that nonusers were more likely to be male, be on Medicaid, lack a regular provider, and have less than a college education, compared to users. Similar disparities existed in who reported being offered access to a portal, with nonwhites also less likely to report being offered access. Reasons for nonuse included the desire to speak directly to providers and privacy concerns, both of which require recognition of the important role of provider communication and patient-provider relationships.",
        "US health care spending increased 9.7 percent to reach $4.1 trillion in 2020, a much faster rate than the 4.3 percent increase seen in 2019. The acceleration in 2020 was due to a 36.0 percent increase in federal expenditures for health care that occurred largely in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, gross domestic product declined 2.2 percent, and the share of the economy devoted to health care spending spiked, reaching 19.7 percent. In 2020 the number of uninsured people fell, while at the same time there were significant shifts in types of coverage.",
        "Genetic testing and spending on that testing have grown rapidly since the mapping of the human genome in 2003. However, it is not widely known how many tests there are, how they are used, and how they are paid for. Little evidence from large data sets about their use has emerged. We shed light on the issue of genetic testing by providing an overview of the testing landscape. We examined test availability and spending for the full spectrum of genetic tests, using unique data sources on test availability and commercial payer spending for privately insured populations, focusing particularly on tests measuring multiple genes in the period 2014\u201317. We found that there were approximately 75,000 genetic tests on the market, with about ten new tests entering the market daily. Prenatal tests accounted for the highest percentage of spending on genetic tests, and spending on hereditary cancer tests accounted for the second-highest. Our results provide insights for those interested in assessing genetic testing markets, test usage, and health policy implications, including current debates over the most appropriate regulatory and payer coverage mechanisms.",
        "Managed competition is a concept that was born in California and has achieved a measure of acceptance there. As California and the United States as a whole continue to struggle with the challenge of providing high-quality health care at a manageable cost, it is worth asking whether managed competition\u2014with its tools for harnessing market forces\u2014continues to hold promise as a means of improving value in health care, and whether the standard conceptualization of managed competition should be modified in any way. In this article we reflect on four aspects of California\u2019s health care ecosystem that provide insights into these questions: integrated delivery systems, patients\u2019 choice of health plans, quality measurement, and new health care marketplace architectures such as Covered California and private insurance exchanges. Overall, while California\u2019s experience with managed competition has resulted in some challenges and adaptations, it also gives reason to believe that principles of managed competition continue to have the potential to be a powerful force toward creating a more efficient health care system.",
        "The global effort to develop a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine is on track to produce one or more authorized vaccines. We examine how different definitions and thresholds of vaccine efficacy, coupled with different levels of implementation effectiveness and background epidemic severity, translate into outcomes including cumulative infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. Using a mathematical simulation of vaccination, we find that factors related to implementation will contribute more to the success of vaccination programs than a vaccine's efficacy as determined in clinical trials. The benefits of a vaccine will decline substantially in the event of manufacturing or deployment delays, significant vaccine hesitancy, or greater epidemic severity. Our findings demonstrate the urgent need for health officials to invest greater financial resources and attention to vaccine production and distribution programs, to redouble efforts to promote public confidence in COVID-19 vaccines, and to encourage continued adherence to other mitigation approaches, even after a vaccine becomes available.",
        "Patient safety in ambulatory care has not been routinely measured. California implemented a pay-for-performance program in safety-net hospitals that incentivized measurement and improvement in key areas of ambulatory safety: referral completion, medication safety, and test follow-up. We present two years of program data (collected during July 2015\u2013June 2017) and show both suboptimal performance in aspects of ambulatory safety and questionable reliability in data reporting. Performance was better in areas that required limited coordination or patient engagement\u2014for example, annual medication monitoring versus follow-up after high-risk mammograms. Health care systems that lack seamlessly integrated electronic health records and patient registries encountered barriers to reporting reliable ambulatory safety data, particularly for measures that integrated multiple data elements. These data challenges precluded accurate performance measurement in many areas. Policy makers and safety advocates need to support the development of information systems and measures that facilitate the accurate ascertainment of the health systems, patients, and clinical tasks at greatest risk for ambulatory safety failures.",
        "US health care spending increased 4.6 percent to reach $3.8 trillion in 2019, similar to the rate of growth of 4.7 percent in 2018. The share of the economy devoted to health care spending was 17.7 percent in 2019 compared with 17.6 percent in 2018. In 2019 faster growth in spending for hospital care, physician and clinical services, and retail purchases of prescription drugs\u2014which together accounted for 61 percent of total national health spending\u2014was offset mainly by expenditures for the net cost of health insurance, which were lower because of the suspension of the health insurance tax in 2019.",
        "TRICARE provides health benefits to more than nine million beneficiaries (active duty and retired military members and their families). Complaints about access to civilian providers in TRICARE\u2019s preferred provider organization (PPO) plan led Congress to mandate surveys of beneficiaries and providers to identify the extent of the problem and the reasons for it. The beneficiary survey asked about beneficiaries\u2019 perceived access to care, and the provider survey asked about providers\u2019 acceptance of TRICARE patients. TRICARE\u2019s civilian PPO plans are required to maintain provider networks wherever TRICARE\u2019s health maintenance organization option (known as Prime) is offered. For the years 2012\u201315, we describe beneficiary access and utilization and provider participation in TRICARE\u2019s PPO plans in Prime and non-Prime markets. We also compare individual market rankings for access and acceptance. In both market types, most providers reported participating in TRICARE\u2019s PPO network, and most PPO users reported using network providers. In areas where Prime is not offered, PPO users reported slightly better access, and providers were more likely to accept new PPO patients. Areas with low access and acceptance, or where multiple access measures indicate problems, may be fruitful for in-depth investigation.",
        "Prescription drug monitoring programs are promising tools to use in addressing the prescription opioid epidemic, yet prescribers' participation in these state-run programs remained low as of 2014. Statutory mandates for prescribers to register with their state's program, use it, or both are believed to be effective tools to realize the programs' full potential. Our analysis of aggregate Medicaid drug utilization data indicates that state mandates for prescriber registration or use adopted in 2011\u201314 were associated with a reduction of 9\u201310 percent in population-adjusted numbers of Schedule II opioid prescriptions received by Medicaid enrollees and amounts of Medicaid spending on these prescriptions. This effect was largely associated with mandates of registration, which were comprehensive in all adopting states, and not with mandates of use, which were largely limited in scope or strength before 2015. Our findings support the use of mandates of registration in prescription drug monitoring programs as an effective and relatively low-cost policy. Future research should further assess the value of strong mandates of use to ensure safer and more appropriate prescribing of opioids.",
        "National health expenditures are projected to grow at an average annual rate of 5.5 percent for 2018\u201327 and represent 19.4 percent of gross domestic product in 2027. Following a ten-year period largely influenced by the Great Recession and major health reform, national health spending growth during 2018\u201327 is expected to be driven primarily by long-observed demographic and economic factors fundamental to the health sector. Prices for health care goods and services are projected to grow 2.5 percent per year, on average, for 2018\u201327\u2014faster than the average price growth experienced over the last decade\u2014and to account for nearly half of projected personal health care spending growth. Among the major payers, average annual spending growth in Medicare (7.4 percent) is expected to exceed that in Medicaid (5.5 percent) and private health insurance (4.8 percent) over the projection period, mostly as a result of comparatively higher projected enrollment growth. The insured share of the population is expected to remain stable at around 90 percent throughout the period, as net gains in health coverage from all sources are projected to keep pace with population growth.",
        "Few studies have illustrated how racism influences Black women\u2019s use of reproductive health care services. This article presents findings of a collaborative study conducted by a research team and a reproductive justice organization to understand Black women\u2019s concerns with sexual and reproductive health services. The qualitative research was conducted with Black women living in Georgia and North Carolina, using a community-based participatory research approach. Themes were developed from participant accounts that highlight how racism, both structural and individual, influenced their reproductive health care access, utilization, and experience. Structural racism affected participants\u2019 finances and led some to forgo care or face barriers to obtaining care. Individual racism resulted in some women electing to receive care only from same-race medical providers. These findings suggest a need for policies and practices that address structural barriers to reproductive health care access and improve the reproductive health experience of Black women.",
        "A 2003 article titled \u201cIt\u2019s the Prices, Stupid,\u201d and coauthored by the three of us and the recently deceased Uwe Reinhardt found that the sizable differences in health spending between the US and other countries were explained mainly by health care prices. As a tribute to him, we used Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Health Statistics to update these analyses and review critiques of the original article. The conclusion that prices are the primary reason why the US spends more on health care than any other country remains valid, despite health policy reforms and health systems restructuring that have occurred in the US and other industrialized countries since the 2003 article\u2019s publication. On key measures of health care resources per capita (hospital beds, physicians, and nurses), the US still provides significantly fewer resources compared to the OECD median country. Since the US is not consuming greater resources than other countries, the most logical factor is the higher prices paid in the US. Because the differential between what the public and private sectors pay for medical services has grown significantly in the past fifteen years, US policy makers should focus on prices in the private sector.",
        "Few patients with opioid use disorder receive medication for addiction treatment. In 2017 the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act enabled nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs) to obtain federal waivers allowing them to prescribe buprenorphine, a key medication for opioid use disorder. The waiver expansion was intended to increase patients' access to opioid use treatment, which was particularly important for rural areas with few physicians. However, little is known about the adoption of these waivers by NPs or PAs in rural areas. Using federal data, we examined waiver adoption in rural areas and its association with scope-of-practice regulations, which set the extent to which NPs or PAs can prescribe medication. From 2016 to 2019 the number of waivered clinicians per 100,000 population in rural areas increased by 111 percent. NPs and PAs accounted for more than half of this increase and were among the first waivered clinicians in 165 rural counties with 3.4 million residents. In rural areas, broad scope-of-practice regulations were associated with twice as many waivered NPs per 100,000 population as restricted scopes of practice were. The rapid growth in the numbers of NPs and PAs with buprenorphine waivers is a promising development in improving access to addiction treatment in rural areas.",
        "More than 500,000 people in the US experience homelessness at any given time, many of whom now qualify for Medicaid in states that expanded coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). In this article we use a novel data set from Arkansas to provide the first estimates of the association between gaining coverage through the ACA\u2019s Medicaid expansion and health services use for a population experiencing homelessness. We find that Medicaid expansion was associated with large initial increases in inpatient hospitalizations and emergency department visits\u2014which declined steadily over time\u2014among adults experiencing homelessness compared with use by a sample of adult traditional Medicaid enrollees. Our results provide evidence of substantial pent-up demand for health care among a population experiencing homelessness in Arkansas that gained health insurance coverage as a result of Medicaid expansion.",
        "The COVID-19 pandemic has illuminated and amplified the harsh reality of health inequities experienced by racial and ethnic minority groups in the United States. Members of these groups have disproportionately been infected and died from COVID-19, yet they still lack equitable access to treatment and vaccines. Lack of equitable access to high-quality health care is in large part a result of structural racism in US health care policy, which structures the health care system to advantage the White population and disadvantage racial and ethnic minority populations. This article provides historical context and a detailed account of modern structural racism in health care policy, highlighting its role in health care coverage, financing, and quality.",
        "Health and housing consortia in New York City offer a model for bridging the divide between the health care and housing sectors. While staff in these sectors often recognize the need to better integrate their services, there are few models for doing so. In this article we describe the formation of a health and housing consortium in the Bronx, New York City, as well as the successful replication of its model in Brooklyn. While each consortium has some features specific to its service area, the primary goal of both is the same: to provide a neutral space for health care and housing organizations to collaborate in what is otherwise often competitive and fragmented territory. In addition, the work of both consortia coalesces around training and resource development, cross-sector communication, and research and advocacy. We provide examples of the Bronx Consortium\u2019s activities in each of these core areas, highlight tangible results to date, and offer recommendations for people interested in undertaking similar efforts.",
        "Efforts to reduce the ranks of the uninsured hinge on take-up of available programs and subsidies, but take-up of even free insurance is often less than complete. The evidence of the effectiveness of policies aiming to increase take-up is limited. We used a randomized controlled design to evaluate the impact of improved communication and behaviorally informed \u201cnudges\u201d designed to increase Medicaid take-up among eligible populations. Fielding randomized interventions in two different study populations in Oregon, we found that even very low-cost interventions substantially increased enrollment. Effects were larger in a population whose members had already expressed interest in obtaining coverage, but the effects were more persistent in low-income populations whose members were already enrolled in other state assistance programs but had not expressed interest in health insurance. The effects were similar across different demographic groups. Our results suggest that improving the design of enrollment processes and using low-cost mass-outreach efforts have the potential to substantially increase insurance coverage of vulnerable populations.",
        "New York City Health + Hospitals is the largest safety-net health care delivery system in the United States. Before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, NYC Health + Hospitals served more than one million patients annually, including the most vulnerable New Yorkers, while billing fewer than five hundred telehealth visits monthly. Once the pandemic struck, we established a strategy to allow us to continue to serve our existing patients while treating the surge of new patients. Starting in March 2020, we were able to transform the system using virtual care platforms through which we conducted almost eighty-three thousand billable televisits in one month, as well as more than thirty thousand behavioral health encounters via telephone and video. Telehealth also enabled us to support patient\u2013family communication, postdischarge follow-up, and palliative care for patients with COVID-19. Expanded Medicaid coverage and insurance reimbursement for telehealth played a pivotal role in this transformation. As we move to a new blend of virtual and in-person care, it is vital that the major regulatory and insurance changes undergirding our COVID-19 telehealth response be sustained to protect access for our most vulnerable patients.",
        "COVID-19 vaccination campaigns continue in the United States, with the expectation that vaccines will slow transmission of the virus, save lives, and enable a return to normal life in due course. However, the extent to which faster vaccine administration has affected COVID-19-related deaths is unknown. We assessed the association between US state-level vaccination rates and COVID-19 deaths during the first five months of vaccine availability. We estimated that by May 9, 2021, the US vaccination campaign was associated with a reduction of 139,393 COVID-19 deaths. The association varied in different states. In New York, for example, vaccinations led to an estimated 11.7 fewer COVID-19 deaths per 10,000, whereas Hawaii observed the smallest reduction, with an estimated 1.1 fewer deaths per 10,000. Overall, our analysis suggests that the early COVID-19 vaccination campaign was associated with reductions in COVID-19 deaths. As of May 9, 2021, reductions in COVID-19 deaths associated with vaccines had translated to value of statistical life benefit ranging between $625 billion and $1.4 trillion.",
        "As of 2015, only 8 percent of US adults ages thirty-five and older had received all of the high-priority, appropriate clinical preventive services recommended for them. Nearly 5 percent of adults did not receive any such services. Further delivery system\u2013level efforts are needed to increase the use of preventive services.",
        "Homicide is a leading cause of death among women who are pregnant and up to one year postpartum in the United States. Most incidents are perpetrated by an intimate partner with a firearm. Some states have implemented laws that prohibit firearm possession by perpetrators of domestic violence and, in some instances, include explicit statutory language mandating relinquishment of firearms once a person has become prohibited from possessing them. We examined the impact of these policies on state-level rates of homicide among pregnant and postpartum women during the period 2011-19. We found that state laws prohibiting possession of firearms and requiring relinquishment of firearms by people convicted of domestic violence-related misdemeanors were associated with substantial reductions in homicide of pregnant and postpartum women. State policy makers should consider further strengthening domestic violence-related firearm regulations and their enforcement to prevent homicide of pregnant and postpartum women.",
        "The Affordable Care Act (ACA) relies on insurers to offer health plans in the individual health insurance Marketplaces. Since the ACA's implementation, levels of Marketplace competition have varied, reaching a nadir in 2018. We examined the characteristics of counties that experienced changes in insurers' participation in the ACA Marketplaces from 2016 to 2021. Using data from the Kaiser Family Foundation and other sources, we found that 1,968 counties (accounting for 66 percent of the US population younger than age sixty-five) have more insurers in 2021 than in 2018, whereas only twelve counties (comprising 0.4 percent of the US nonelderly population) have fewer insurers. The number of counties with monopolist Marketplace insurers declined from 1,616 in 2018 to 294 in 2021. Recent Marketplace insurer gains were more likely in counties that lost insurers from 2016 to 2018 or had a monopolist insurer in 2018. Increased competition may lead to lower gross premiums in the ACA Marketplaces. Given the Biden administration's support for the ACA Marketplaces, it appears likely that the ACA individual health insurance market will be stable and profitable for the next several years.",
        "To contain the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, health and government authorities have imposed sweeping self-quarantine orders for communities worldwide. Health officials assume that the public will have high rates of compliance. However, studies suggest that a major obstacle to compliance for household quarantine is concern about loss of income. A cross-sectional study of the adult population of Israel was conducted in the last week of February 2020 to assess public attitudes toward the COVID-19 outbreak. In particular, public compliance rates with self-quarantine were assessed, depending on whether lost wages would be compensated for. When compensation was assumed, the compliance rate was 94 percent. When compensation was removed, the compliance rate dropped to less than 57 percent. This study demonstrated that providing people with assurances about their livelihoods during self-quarantine is an important component of compliance with public health regulations.",
        "New York City has emerged as the global epicenter for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The city's public health system, New York City Health + Hospitals, has been key to the city's response because its vulnerable patient population is disproportionately affected by the disease. As the number of cases rose in the city, NYC Health + Hospitals carried out plans to greatly expand critical care capacity. Primary intensive care unit (ICU) spaces were identified and upgraded as needed, and new ICU spaces were created in emergency departments, procedural areas, and other inpatient units. Patients were transferred between hospitals to reduce strain. Critical care staffing was supplemented by temporary recruits, volunteers, and Department of Defense medical personnel. Supplies needed to deliver critical care were monitored closely and replenished to prevent interruptions. An emergency department action team was formed to ensure that the experience of front-line providers was informing network-level decisions. The steps taken by NYC Health + Hospitals greatly expanded its capacity to provide critical care during an unprecedented surge of COVID-19 cases in NYC. These steps, along with lessons learned, could inform preparations for other health systems during a primary or secondary surge of cases.",
        "Although approximately one in five Medicare beneficiaries are discharged from hospital acute care to postacute care at skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), little is known about access to timely medical care for these patients after they are admitted to a SNF. Our analysis of 2,392,753 such discharges from hospitals under fee-for-service Medicare in the period January 2012\u2013October 2014 indicated that first visits by a physician or advanced practitioner (a nurse practitioner or physician assistant) for initial medical assessment occurred within four days of SNF admission in 71.5 percent of the stays. However, there was considerable variation in days to first visit at the regional, facility, and patient levels. We estimated that in 10.4 percent of stays there was no physician or advanced practitioner visit. Understanding the underlying reasons for, and consequences of, variability in timing and receipt of initial medical assessment after admission to a SNF for postacute care may prove important for improving patient outcomes and particularly relevant to current efforts to promote value-based purchasing in postacute care.",
        "What factors do health and human services leaders assess when considering collaborative opportunities, and what do they worry about? How organizational decision makers perceive risk can influence the success or failure of cross-sector partnerships designed to address social determinants of health. This article captures insights from leaders at twenty-two health and human services organizations in Oregon who were involved in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' Accountable Health Communities initiative in 2019 and familiar with efforts by their local health systems to identify people with unmet social needs and refer them to community programs. We explore perspectives on the risks and benefits associated with this cross-sector work. Leaders from both sectors perceived collaboration risks to reputation, sustainability, and compliance with regulatory or funder requirements. They also had difficulty gauging the reliability of partners that were sometimes perceived as competitive or coercive. Risk perceptions were manifested differently across sectors, which has implications for the design, implementation, and governance of cross-sector initiatives.",
        "Private equity firms have increased their participation in the US health care system, raising questions about incentive alignment and downstream effects on patients. However, there is a lack of systematic characterization of private equity acquisition of short-term acute care hospitals. We present an overview of the scope of private equity-backed hospital acquisitions over the course of 2003-17, comparing the financial and operational differences between those hospitals and hospitals that remained unacquired through 2017. A total of 42 private equity deals occurred, involving 282 unique hospitals across 36 states. In unadjusted analyses, hospitals that were acquired had larger bed sizes, more discharges, and more full-time-equivalent staff positions in 2003 relative to nonacquired hospitals; private equity-acquired hospitals also had higher charge-to-cost ratios and higher operating margins, and this gap widened during our study period. These findings motivate evaluations by policy makers and researchers on the impact, if any, of private equity acquisition on health care access, spending, and risk-adjusted outcomes.",
        "By 2030 more people in the United States will be older than age sixty-five than younger than age five. Our health care system is unprepared for the complexity of caring for a heterogenous population of older adults\u2014a problem that has been magnified by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Here, as part of the National Academy of Medicine\u2019s Vital Directions for Health and Health Care: Priorities for 2021 initiative, we identify six vital directions to improve the care and quality of life for all older Americans. The next administration must create an adequately prepared workforce; strengthen the role of public health; remediate disparities and inequities; develop, evaluate, and implement new approaches to care delivery; allocate resources to achieve patient-centered care and outcomes, including palliative and end-of-life care; and redesign the structure and financing of long-term services and supports. If these priorities are addressed proactively, an infrastructure can be created that promotes better health and equitable, goal-directed care that recognizes the preferences and needs of older adults.",
        "Little is known about how racism and bias may be communicated in the medical record. This study used machine learning to analyze electronic health records (EHRs) from an urban academic medical center and to investigate whether providers' use of negative patient descriptors varied by patient race or ethnicity. We analyzed a sample of 40,113 history and physical notes (January 2019-October 2020) from 18,459 patients for sentences containing a negative descriptor (for example, resistant or noncompliant) of the patient or the patient's behavior. We used mixed effects logistic regression to determine the odds of finding at least one negative descriptor as a function of the patient's race or ethnicity, controlling for sociodemographic and health characteristics. Compared with White patients, Black patients had 2.54 times the odds of having at least one negative descriptor in the history and physical notes. Our findings raise concerns about stigmatizing language in the EHR and its potential to exacerbate racial and ethnic health care disparities.",
        "New data for 2014\u201315 from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey\u2013Insurance Component longitudinal survey show substantial churn in insurance offers by small employers (those with fifty or fewer workers), with 14.6 percent of employers that offered insurance in 2014 having dropped it in 2015 and 5.5 percent of those that did not offer it adding coverage.",
        "In light of South Africa's high prenatal HIV prevalence and infant mortality rate, a cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate an intervention called Philani+, which used community health workers (known as Mentor Mothers) to deliver pre- and postnatal home visits in Cape Town, South Africa, to improve maternal and child health. We assessed the costs and benefits of this intervention and made comparisons with other scenarios that depicted increased capacity and provision of nurse-delivered care. The recurrent cost of the twenty-four-month intervention was US$80,001. The major health outcomes analyzed were differences in the proportion of infants who were low birthweight, stunted, and suboptimally breastfed between intervention and control groups. Each case of low birthweight averted cost US$2,397; of stunted growth, US$2,454; and of suboptimal breastfeeding, US$1,618. Employment of community health workers was cost saving compared to that of nurses. Philani+ improved child health at a relatively low cost, considering the health system costs associated with low birthweight and undernutrition. The model could be suitable for replication in low-resource settings to improve child health in other countries.",
        "The Hyde Amendment prevents federal funds, including Medicaid, from covering abortion care, and many states have legal restrictions that prevent private insurance plans from covering abortion. As a result, most people pay for abortion out of pocket. We examined patient self-pay charges for three abortion types (medication abortion, first-trimester procedural abortion, and second-trimester abortion), as well as facilities\u2019 acceptance of health insurance, during the period 2017\u201320. We found that during this time, median patient charges increased for medication abortion (from $495 to $560) and first-trimester procedural abortion (from $475 to $575) but not second-trimester abortion (from $935 to $895). The proportion of facilities that accept insurance decreased over time (from 89 percent to 80 percent). We noted substantial regional variation, with the South having lower costs and lower insurance acceptance. Charges for first-trimester procedural abortions are increasing, and acceptance of health insurance is declining. According to the Federal Reserve, one-quarter of Americans could not pay for a $400 emergency expense solely with the money in their bank accounts\u2014an amount lower than any abortion cost in 2020. Lifting Hyde restrictions and requiring public and private health insurance to cover this essential, time-sensitive health service without copays or deductibles would greatly reduce the financial burden of abortion.",
        "Building a health workforce in low-income countries requires a focused investment of time and resources, and ministries of health need tools to create staffing plans and prioritize spending on staff for overburdened health facilities. In Zambia a demand-based workload model was developed to calculate the number of health workers required to meet demands for essential health services and inform a rational and optimized strategy for deploying new public-sector staff members to the country's health facilities. Between 2009 and 2011 Zambia applied this optimized deployment policy, allocating new health workers to areas with the greatest demand for services. The country increased its health worker staffing in districts with fewer than one health worker per 1,000 people by 25.2 percent, adding 949 health workers to facilities that faced severe staffing shortages. At facilities that had had low staffing levels, adding a skilled provider was associated with an additional 103 outpatient consultations per quarter. Policy makers in resource-limited countries should consider using strategic approaches to identifying and deploying a rational distribution of health workers to provide the greatest coverage of health services to their populations.",
        "Congress and many state legislatures are considering expanding access to telemedicine. To inform this debate, we analyzed Medicare fee-for-service claims for the period 2004\u201314 to understand trends in and recent use of telemedicine for mental health care, also known as telemental health. The study population consisted of rural beneficiaries with a diagnosis of any mental illness or serious mental illness. The number of telemental health visits grew on average 45.1 percent annually, and by 2014 there were 5.3 and 11.8 telemental health visits per 100 rural beneficiaries with any mental illness or serious mental illness, respectively. There was notable variation across states: In 2014 nine had more than twenty-five visits per 100 beneficiaries with serious mental illness, while four states and the District of Columbia had none. Compared to other beneficiaries with mental illness, beneficiaries who received a telemental health visit were more likely to be younger than sixty-five, be eligible for Medicare because of disability, and live in a relatively poor community. States with a telemedicine parity law and a pro\u2013telemental health regulatory environment had significantly higher rates of telemental health use than those that did not.",
        "Health disparities-differences in health status, treatment, or outcomes-exist between racial and ethnic minorities; people with low socioeconomic status; lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people; women; people with disabilities; and others, compared with majority populations. Improved insurance coverage and targeted efforts by health care systems have narrowed some disparities, but many gaps remain. There is a growing recognition that interventions outside the health care sector that address social determinants of health such as housing, employment, and education are also needed. The effects of interventions in these areas are of interest to health services researchers. Innovative cross-sector approaches that improve health through medical and nonmedical interventions hold promise for further reducing health disparities.",
        "Patients with advanced illness receive fragmented, hospital-based care that is unaligned with their preferences near the end of life. We describe a team-based intervention that provides home-based, coordinated care to more than 2,000 seriously ill patients daily in nineteen urban, suburban, or rural counties in California. In the last month of life, compared to matched Medicare beneficiaries in similar counties, this program reduced hospital days by 1,361 per 1,000 beneficiaries, hospital deaths by 8.2 percent, inpatient payments by $6,127, and the total cost of care by $5,657 per beneficiary. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has announced a new Medicare payment model for serious illness care, based in part on this program. To inform model development and implementation, we describe lessons learned about changing the focus of care for advanced illness from hospital to home, broadening care coordination to achieve system integration, and developing methods for payment and quality accountability that transform care delivery.",
        "Medication treatment (MT) is one of the few evidence-based strategies proposed to combat the current opioid epidemic. We examined national trends and correlates of offering MT in substance use treatment facilities in the United States. According to data from national surveys, the proportion of these facilities that offered any MT increased from 20.0 percent in 2007 to 36.1 percent in 2016\u2014mainly the result of increases in offering buprenorphine and extended-release naltrexone. Only 6.1 percent of facilities offered all three MT medications in 2016. Facilities in states with higher opioid overdose death rates, facilities that accepted health insurance overall (and, more specifically, those that accepted Medicaid in states that opted to expand eligibility for Medicaid), and facilities in states with more comprehensive coverage of MT under their Medicaid plans had higher odds of offering MT. The findings highlight the persistent unmet need for MT nationally and the role of expansion of health insurance in the dissemination of these treatments.",
        "The Affordable Care Act (ACA) attempted to minimize disruptions to employer-sponsored insurance in part by implementing an employer mandate. Research has shown that employer coverage rates have been stable nationally under the ACA. Massachusetts enacted its own employer mandate in 2006 before eliminating it in 2014, in anticipation of the federal mandate. But the ACA's employer mandate was delayed until 2015 and exempted smaller firms that had been covered by the Massachusetts' mandate. In this unique policy environment, we found that the employer-sponsored insurance rate in Massachusetts fell by 2.3 percentage points after the ACA's coverage expansion took effect (2014-16), compared to the rest of the US. Coverage dropped more for middle-income workers than for lower-income workers, which suggests that crowd-out by Medicaid was not the primary factor. Employer surveys show that employer coverage offer rates declined significantly at small firms in Massachusetts beginning in 2014, but not at large firms. Our findings suggest that eliminating Massachusetts's employer mandate may have contributed to falling employer coverage rates in the state, although other policy and economic factors cannot be ruled out. These results may have implications for understanding the effects of the ACA's employer mandate and its potential repeal.",
        "Analysis of Current Population Survey data suggests a tightening labor market for registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, and nursing assistants, marked by falling employment and rising wages through June 2021. Unemployment rates remain higher in nonhospital settings and among registered nurses and nursing assistants who are members of racial and ethnic minority groups.",
        "Working families have increasingly enrolled their children in Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program in recent years. Parents\u2019 place of employment affects the availability and cost of family health insurance, making it a determinant of pediatric public insurance enrollment. We examined that enrollment in the period 2008\u201316 in families working full time and earning more than 100 percent of the federal poverty level at three types of employers. Among low-income families (100\u2013199 percent of poverty), children\u2019s public health insurance coverage was highest for those with parents employed at small private firms, increasing from 53 percent to 79 percent, while the public insurance coverage rate also increased among children with parents working for large private firms (from 45 percent to 69 percent). Among moderate-income families (200\u2013299 percent of poverty) working at small private firms, public coverage increased from 21 percent to 64 percent. Increases in the number of working families with pediatric public insurance were driven by employees of large private firms. Maintaining high pediatric insurance coverage rates will require policies that recognize the changing role of public insurance for working families as the cost of employer-based coverage grows.",
        "In the United States, steps to advance health equity often take place at the state and local levels rather than the national level. Using publicly available data sources, we developed a scorecard for all fifty states and the District of Columbia that measures indicators of the use of five evidence-based policies to address domains related to health equity. The indicators are the cigarette excise tax rate, a state's Medicaid expansion status and the size of its coverage gap, percentage of four-year olds enrolled in state-funded pre-kindergarten, minimum wage level, and the presence of state-funded housing subsidy programs and homelessness prevention and rapid rehousing programs. We found that states varied significantly in their implementation of the selected policies and concluded that a variety of approaches to encourage policy changes at the state level will be needed to create healthier and more equitable communities. We describe promising, feasible state-level approaches for states to \"do something, do more, do better\" when they take action on the five selected policies that can promote health equity.",
        "Climate change affects our health. The effects of climate on various determinants of disease, such as vectorborne illnesses, extreme weather, and air pollution, will magnify existing social and economic inequalities, disproportionately affecting the poorest and most vulnerable regions around the world, where exposure and susceptibility are high. Climate-resilient and sustainable health systems are critical as global temperatures continue to rise.",
        "The past decade has seen a growing recognition of the importance of social determinants of health for health outcomes. However, the degree to which US health systems are directly investing in community programs to address social determinants of health as opposed to screening and referral is uncertain. We searched for all public announcements of new programs involving direct financial investments in social determinants of health by US health systems from January 1, 2017, to November 30, 2019. We identified seventy-eight unique programs involving fifty-seven health systems that collectively included 917 hospitals. The programs involved at least $2.5 billion of health system funds, of which $1.6 billion in fifty-two programs was specifically committed to housing-focused interventions. Additional focus areas were employment (twenty-eight programs, $1.1 billion), education (fourteen programs, $476.4 million), food security (twenty-five programs, $294.2 million), social and community context (thirteen programs, $253.1 million), and transportation (six programs, $32 million). Health systems are making sizable investments in social determinants of health.",
        "Different staffing configurations in primary and geriatric care practices could have implications for how best to deliver services that are essential for a growing population of older adults. Using data from a 2018 survey of physicians (MDs) and nurse practitioners (NPs) working in primary and geriatric care, we assessed whether different configurations were associated with better or worse performance on a number of standard process measures indicative of comprehensive, high-quality primary care. Practices with a large concentration of MDs had the highest estimated labor costs. Practices high in NPs and physician assistants (PAs) were most common in states that grant full scope of practice to NPs. The high-NP/PA configuration was associated with a 17-percentage-point greater probability of facilitating patient visits and a 26-percentage-point greater probability of providing the full bundle of primary care services compared with the high-MD model. Team-based configurations had a 27.7-percentage-point greater probability of providing the full bundle of primary care services. The complex needs of older adults may be best served by team-based practices with a broad provider mix that can provide a range of services in the office and the community.",
        "The Institute of Medicine's report on Dying in America called for honoring treatment preferences near the end of life for seriously ill patients. To achieve this objective, the report recommended that patients, their family members, other loved ones, and providers engage in shared decision making about current and future treatment decisions (that is, advance care planning). Yet decision science research suggests that preferences are objectively difficult to specify for complex contingencies and subjectively difficult to specify for unfamiliar choices. Because advance care planning involves both difficulties\u2014the future may unfold in complex ways and pose unprecedented choices\u2014it may not fully and faithfully specify patients' preferences. I discuss a powerful but overlooked influence on this planning: local providers' practice norms. Norms often begin as generally accepted procedures but evolve into rules enforced by both external and internal sanctions (such as shame and pride). Local practice norms regarding the timing, content, and interpretation of advance care planning conversations influence patient choice. While the influence of providers on patients' decisions cannot be entirely removed, I recommend increasing providers' awareness of this influence by using audit, feedback, and coaching and by systematizing processes for advance care planning.",
        "The Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which was enacted twenty years ago, covers uninsured children who do not qualify for Medicaid but lack access to affordable coverage. Together these safety-net programs have boosted the health insurance coverage rate among US children to historic levels, exceeding 95 percent of children in 2015. However, the future of both CHIP and Medicaid is uncertain. In the current congressional debate over the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid has become a target for potential funding reductions and other changes that would undermine the scope of children\u2019s coverage. Congress has yet to act to extend CHIP funding beyond September 30, 2017, when the current appropriation expires. State and federal policy makers should act now to preserve the foundation of coverage currently in place while striving to ensure that every child in the United States has health coverage.",
        "The Institute of Medicine's To Err Is Human, published in 1999, represented a watershed moment for the US health care system. The report dramatically raised the profile of patient safety and stimulated dedicated research funding to this essential aspect of patient care. Highly effective interventions have since been developed and adopted for hospital-acquired infections and medication safety, although the impact of these interventions varies because of their inconsistent implementation and practice. Progress in addressing other hospital-acquired adverse events has been variable. In the past two decades additional areas of safety risk have been identified and targeted for intervention, such as outpatient care, diagnostic errors, and the use of health information technology. In sum, the frequency of preventable harm remains high, and new scientific and policy approaches to address both prior and emerging risk areas are imperative. With the increasing availability of electronic data, investments must now be made in developing and testing methods to routinely and continuously measure the frequency and types of patient harm and even predict risk of harm for specific patients. This progress could lead us from a Bronze Age of rudimentary tool development to a Golden Era of vast improvement in patient safety.",
        "In 2015 Medicare launched the Physician Value-Based Payment Modifier program, the largest US ambulatory care pay-for-performance program to date and a precursor to the forthcoming Merit-based Incentive Payment System. In its first year, the program included practices with a hundred or more clinicians. We found that 1,010 practices met this criterion, 899 of which had at least one attributed beneficiary. Of these latter practices, 263 (29.3 percent) failed to report performance data and received a 1 percent reporting-based penalty. Of the 636 practices that reported performance data, those that elected quality tiering\u2014voluntarily receiving performance-based penalties or bonuses\u2014and those with high use of electronic health records had better performance on quality and costs than other practices. Practices with a primary care focus had better quality than other practices but similar costs. These findings translated into differences in the receipt of penalties and bonuses and may have implications for performance patterns under the Merit-based Incentive Payment System.",
        "Structural racism toward American Indians and Alaska Natives is found in nearly every policy regarding and action taken toward that population since non-Natives made first contact with the Indigenous peoples of the United States. Generations of American Indians and Alaska Natives have suffered from policies that called for their genocide as well as policies intended to acculturate and dominate them-such as the sentiment from Richard Henry Pratt to \"kill the Indian\u2026, save the man.\" The intergenerational effect is one that has left American Indians and Alaska Natives at the margins of health and the health care system. The effect is devastating psychologically, eroding a value system that is based on community and the sanctity of all creation. Using stories we collected from American Indian people who have experienced the results of racist policies, we describe historical trauma and its links to the health of American Indians and Alaska Natives. We develop two case studies around these stories, including one from a member of the Navajo Nation's experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, to illustrate biases in institutionalized structures. Finally, we describe how the American Indian and Alaska Native Cultural Wisdom Declaration can help policy makers eliminate the effect of systemic racism on the health of American Indians and Alaska Natives-for instance, by lifting constraints on federal funding for American Indian and Alaska Native initiatives and allowing payment to traditional healers for their health services.",
        "The San Francisco Health Care Security Ordinance is the country\u2019s only local law designed to promote universal health care. It provides access to health services for the uninsured while requiring employers to contribute financially toward employees\u2019 health care costs. Enrollment in Healthy San Francisco, a program for the uninsured that is one component of the ordinance, fell significantly after the Affordable Care Act extended other types of coverage. Healthy San Francisco continues as a major source of care for undocumented people. Many other California counties have programs that provide at least some nonemergency care to undocumented residents, which demonstrates the versatility of this approach for localities. San Francisco employer contributions also fund medical reimbursement accounts that help insured people pay their health costs, including through a program added in 2016 to make Marketplace insurance more affordable. The city\u2019s experiences show that programs to help people pay for private coverage should be simple and include strong outreach and education and that the affordability of Marketplace coverage would be most easily addressed at the state level.",
        "Growing up in a rural setting is a strong predictor of future rural practice for physicians. This study reports on the fifteen-year decline in the number of rural medical students, culminating in rural students' representing less than 5 percent of all incoming medical students in 2017. Furthermore, students from underrepresented racial/ethnic minority groups in medicine (URM) with rural backgrounds made up less than 0.5 percent of new medical students in 2017. Both URM and non-URM students with rural backgrounds are substantially and increasingly underrepresented in medical school. If the number of rural students entering medical school were to become proportional to the share of rural residents in the US population, the number would have to quadruple. To date, medical schools' efforts to recognize and value a rural background have been insufficient to stem the decline in the number of rural medical students. Policy makers and other stakeholders should recognize the exacerbated risk to rural access created by this trend. Efforts to reinforce the rural pipeline into medicine warrant further investment and ongoing evaluation.",
        "Social discourse about the opioid crisis in the US has focused on White populations, even though opioid-related deaths have grown at a higher rate among people of color than among non-Hispanic White people in recent years. Medications for opioid use disorder (OUD) are the gold standard for treating OUD and preventing overdose but are underused among people with OUD, with disproportionately low treatment initiation and retention among people of color. Methadone, which is highly stigmatized and has a more burdensome treatment regimen, is the predominant medication for OUD available to people of color. To address disparities in the initiation and retention of treatment using medication for OUD, policy makers should consider strategies such as Medicaid expansion, increased grant funding for federally qualified health centers to provide buprenorphine treatment, retention of temporary telehealth policies that allow remote buprenorphine induction, and regulatory changes to allow methadone treatment in office-based practices.",
        "Distance traveled to a provider has been associated with access to and timely use of health care services. Medicaid expansion has been previously linked to an increase in the number of providers accepting Medicaid patients. We hypothesized that by increasing the density of providers accepting Medicaid in any area, Louisiana\u2019s Medicaid expansion in July 2016 may have increased access to health care services for Medicaid patients already eligible for Medicaid in Louisiana by decreasing distances traveled to reach health care providers. We tested our hypothesis using a regression discontinuity model on all continuously enrolled Louisiana Medicaid beneficiaries\u2019 transactions from the period 2015\u201317 across eight different service lines. Distance traveled to appointments declined across all service lines, with declines ranging from \u22123.46 miles for general practices to \u22120.70 miles for specialty care. The most robust declines in distance traveled were among Black enrollees living in nonmetropolitan areas, with the largest being a decline of 9.25 fewer miles traveled for general practice care. Medicaid expansion has the potential to address racial and geographic disparities in health care access through decreased travel distances.",
        "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spurred a rapid rise in telemedicine, but it is unclear how use has varied by clinical and patient factors during the pandemic. We examined the variation in total outpatient visits and telemedicine use across patient demographics, specialties, and conditions in a database of 16.7 million commercially insured and Medicare Advantage enrollees from January to June 2020. During the pandemic, 30.1 percent of all visits were provided via telemedicine, and the weekly number of visits increased twenty-three-fold compared with the prepandemic period. Telemedicine use was lower in communities with higher rates of poverty (31.9 percent versus 27.9 percent for the lowest and highest quartiles of poverty rate, respectively). Across specialties, the use of any telemedicine during the pandemic ranged from 68 percent of endocrinologists to 9 percent of ophthalmologists. Across common conditions, the percentage of visits provided during the pandemic via telemedicine ranged from 53 percent for depression to 3 percent for glaucoma. Higher rates of telemedicine use for common conditions were associated with smaller decreases in total weekly visits during the pandemic.",
        "Rural populations disproportionately suffer from adverse health outcomes, including poorer health and higher age-adjusted mortality. We argue that these disparities are due in part to declining health care provider availability and accessibility in rural communities. Rural challenges are exacerbated by \"structural urbanism\"-elements of the current public health and health care systems that disadvantage rural communities. We suggest that biases in current models of health care funding, which treat health care as a service for an individual rather than as infrastructure for a population, are innately biased in favor of large populations. Until this bias is recognized, the development of viable models for care across the rural-urban continuum cannot move forward.",
        "More than 20 percent of Affordable Care Act (ACA) exchange market (Marketplace) members insured by a large national insurer in 2015 and 2016 enrolled during a special enrollment period (SEP), defined as any enrollment outside the annual open enrollment period. These members were younger and had approximately 34 percent higher average monthly total costs than members who enrolled during open enrollment. SEP members had 69\u2013114 percent higher inpatient costs and 11\u201319 percent higher emergency department costs than open enrollment members. Higher costs, especially among a slightly younger population, may suggest potential adverse selection among SEP members, which could contribute to increased premiums and insurer exit from ACA Marketplaces. Although SEP members had a shorter average enrollment length per calendar year, they were more likely than open enrollment members to stay insured through the end of the calendar year and to renew in a Marketplace plan offered by the insurer in the following year. However, renewing SEP and open enrollment members were older, sicker, and costlier than nonrenewing members of both enrollee types, which suggests that healthier members are switching carriers or leaving the market over time. Additional research is urgently needed to inform evidence-based policy regarding Marketplace risk adjustment and SEP eligibility rules and to improve outreach to people who are eligible for SEP enrollment.",
        "Structural racism causes significant inequities in the diagnosis of perinatal and maternal mental health disorders and access to perinatal and maternal mental health treatment. Black birthing populations are particularly burdened by disjointed systems of care for mental health. To identify strategies to address racism and inequities in maternal and infant mental health care, we interviewed ten Black women who support Black birthing people, including mental health practitioners, researchers, and activists, in February 2021. The five key pathways to address racism and inequities that we identified from the stakeholder interviews are educating and training practitioners; investing in the Black women mental health workforce; investing in Black women\u2013led community-based organizations; valuing, honoring, and investing in community and traditional healing practices; and promoting integrated care and shared decision making. These pathways highlight critical resources needed to improve the quality of maternal mental health care for Black birthing populations.",
        "In this study we explored sociodemographic disparities in COVID-19 vaccine access upon initial rollout at Publix grocery store locations throughout Florida in January 2021. Florida officials reported that they chose Publix stores for the vaccine rollout because the chain has so many stores in the state and was considered at the time to be better prepared than other retailers. Data on education levels, ethnicity, race, percentage at or below the poverty level, and percentage single-parent households were collected from the 2019 census for 974 Florida ZIP codes. We used hotspot analysis to measure spatial clustering of Publix vaccination sites per 100,000 people. We identified hot spots (areas with greater vaccine availability) in moderately populated areas where the population was significantly older, richer, and Whiter than in areas of lower vaccine availability (cold spots). Cold spots were identified in areas of low and high population density, areas with a higher proportion of Hispanic residents, and areas with a higher proportion of single-parent households, including Miami-Dade County and inland regions of Florida. Multivariate analysis showed strong associations between the number of vaccination sites in a ZIP code and race and ethnicity and a weaker association with percentage of residents at or below the poverty level. Future vaccine distribution should continue to be monitored through a socioeconomic lens to help prevent unequal access.",
        "During the period 2014\u201316 the Affordable Care Act (ACA) dramatically reduced rates of uninsurance and underinsurance in the United States. In this study we estimated the effects of these coverage increases on cancer detection among the near-elderly population (ages 60\u201364). Using 2010\u201316 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program data, we estimated that the ACA increased cancer detection among this population. We found that 45 percent of the jump in cancer detection that occurs when people reach Medicare eligibility age was eliminated by the ACA coverage expansions. The ACA coverage expansions had large effects on cancers with and without routine screening tests, and 68 percent of newly detected cancers were early- and middle-stage cancers. In addition, the empirical strategy used to identify the effects of the ACA on cancer detection confirmed the role of health insurance as the key mechanism to explain Medicare's effects on health care use and health outcomes as described in the prior literature. Our results highlight the importance of the ACA, Medicare, and health insurance coverage generally for disease detection.",
        "People with disabilities face barriers when attempting to gain access to health care settings. Using qualitative analysis of three physician focus groups, we identified physical, communication, knowledge, structural, and attitudinal barriers to care for people with disabilities. Physicians reported feeling overwhelmed by the demands of practicing medicine in general and the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 specifically; in particular, they felt that they were inadequately reimbursed for accommodations. Some physicians reported that because of these concerns, they attempted to discharge people with disabilities from their practices. Increasing health care access for people with disabilities will require increasing the accessibility of space and the availability of proper equipment, improving the education of clinicians about the care of people with disabilities, and removing structural barriers in the health care delivery system. Our findings also suggest that physicians\u2019 bias and general reluctance to care for people with disabilities play a role in perpetuating the health care disparities they experience.",
        "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic response brought forth major changes in innovation policy. This article takes stock of the key features of the COVID-19 innovation system-the network of public and private actors influencing the development and diffusion of technologies to combat the pandemic. Before the pandemic, biomedical research and development policy consisted largely of \"push\" funding from the public sector in support of basic research and \"pull\" incentives from patents to motivate private companies to invest in clinical trials and develop drugs and vaccines. In contrast, during the pandemic, public funding shifted its focus to late-stage product development and manufacturing. Procurement agreements with governments replaced traditional pull incentives from patents for the major private companies. Nonpatent barriers to competition may also have incentivized innovation. The challenges to ensuring diffusion have gained in prominence during the pandemic, though it is unclear what role patents will play in pricing and access. Some aspects of this approach to biomedical innovation may be unique to crises, but others could provide lessons for policy beyond the pandemic.",
        "Even with great advances in behavioral health policy in the last decade, the problems of mental illness and addiction persist in the United States\u2014so more needs to be done. In this article, which is part of the National Academy of Medicine's Vital Directions for Health and Health Care: Priorities for 2021 initiative, we describe the steps needed to improve outcomes, focusing on three strategies. We argue for transforming the behavioral health system to meet people where they are, decriminalizing mental illness and substance use disorders to facilitate recovery, and raising awareness of social context and social needs as essential to effective care. We call for supporting structures in the workforce and structures of accountability, outcome measurement, and more generous financing of behavioral health care. These steps have costs, but the enormous benefits of a major transformation in behavioral health policy far outweigh the expenses.",
        "California has led the nation in coverage gains related to the Affordable Care Act, but it struggles to provide health services for its large population of undocumented immigrants and hold down prices for everyone. This DataGraphic shows where residents get their health coverage, who's uninsured and why, and which areas of the state have the most heavily concentrated hospital and physician markets. It then turns its eye to state and local efforts to improve health outcomes through the prevention of heart attacks and maternal deaths and limits on childhood vaccines exemptions.",
        "All-cause mortality rates in rural areas have exceeded those in urban areas of the US since the 1980s, and the gap continues to widen. Yet no definitive causes of this difference are known, and within-state differences that might be amenable to state-level policy have not been explored. An analysis of 2016 state-level data indicated that rural mortality exceeded urban mortality in all but three states, with substantial variability in both rates across states. Overall, higher rural mortality at the state level can be mainly explained by three factors: socioeconomic deprivation, physician shortages, and lack of health insurance. To a certain degree, these factors reflect a state\u2019s health policies, such as expansion of eligibility for Medicaid, health infrastructure, and socioeconomic conditions. Our findings suggest that state and federal policy efforts to address rural-urban disparities in these areas could alleviate the higher rates of all-cause mortality faced by rural US residents.",
        "Globally, two-thirds of child deaths could be prevented by increased provision of health interventions such as vaccines, micronutrient supplements, and water purification tablets. We report the results from a randomized controlled trial in Haiti during 2012 that tested whether microfinance institutions\u2014which reach 200 million households worldwide\u2014can effectively deliver health products. These institutions provide loans to underserved entrepreneurs, primarily poor women in rural areas. In the intervention group, micronutrient powders to improve the nutrition of young children were distributed at regularly occurring microfinance meetings by a trained borrower. In both the control and the intervention groups, nurses led seminars on nutrition and extended breastfeeding during microfinance meetings. At three-month follow-up, the mean difference in hemoglobin concentration between children in the intervention group and those in the control group was 0.28 grams per deciliter (g/dL)\u2014with a subsample of younger children (under two years of age) showing greater relative improvement (0.46 g/dL)\u2014and the odds ratio for children in the intervention group meeting the diagnostic criteria for anemia was 0.64. The results are similar to those of previous studies that evaluated micronutrient powder distribution through dedicated health institutions. Our findings suggest that microfinance institutions are a promising platform for the large-scale delivery of health products in low-income countries.",
        "The diversity of health contexts in which members of the US Latinx population establish residence may provide insights into the variety of health challenges they face. We investigated differences in health professional shortages, general health services, health care safety-net supply, health access, and population health rankings across 3,113 US counties classified as established, new, or other Latinx population destinations. Compared with new destinations, established destinations had more health professional shortages, as well as higher rates of child and adult health uninsurance. New destinations had fewer health care safety-net services per 100,000 county residents than established destinations. Health contexts thus differ in significant ways across new and established Latinx destinations, and these differences have key implications for Latinx immigrant health.",
        "Although end-of-life medical spending is often viewed as a major component of aggregate medical expenditure, accurate measures of this type of medical spending are scarce. We used detailed health care data for the period 2009\u201311 from Denmark, England, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Taiwan, the United States, and the Canadian province of Quebec to measure the composition and magnitude of medical spending in the three years before death. In all nine countries, medical spending at the end of life was high relative to spending at other ages. Spending during the last twelve months of life made up a modest share of aggregate spending, ranging from 8.5 percent in the United States to 11.2 percent in Taiwan, but spending in the last three calendar years of life reached 24.5 percent in Taiwan. This suggests that high aggregate medical spending is due not to last-ditch efforts to save lives but to spending on people with chronic conditions, which are associated with shorter life expectancies.",
        "There are currently more adults age fifty-five or older incarcerated in the United States than ever before. Little is known about the epidemiology or health care needs of geriatric patients in jails, where the majority of the population is being held in pretrial detention. We performed a retrospective analysis of electronic health record data to characterize the demographics, health conditions, and health care use of people age fifty-five or older who were incarcerated in the New York City jail system between 2015 and 2019. People in this age group accounted for 4 percent of admissions to the jails in 2009, ten years before the study's end date; 7 percent of admissions in 2015, when the study began; and 8.5 percent of admissions by 2019. They were more likely to report being homeless; suffer from a serious mental illness designation; carry a higher burden of chronic, infectious, and serious medical illnesses; be hospitalized during their incarceration; and die in jail custody than their younger counterparts. All elements of the criminal justice system need to be attuned to the vulnerabilities of this group, implement targeted interventions to divert them from incarceration when possible, and minimize harms for those who end up incarcerated.",
        "In the United States, severe maternal morbidity and mortality is climbing\u2014a reality that is especially challenging for rural communities, which face declining access to obstetric services. Severe maternal morbidity refers to potentially life-threatening complications or the need to undergo a lifesaving procedure during or immediately following childbirth. Using data for 2007\u201315 from the National Inpatient Sample, we analyzed severe maternal morbidity and mortality during childbirth hospitalizations among rural and urban residents. We found that severe maternal morbidity and mortality increased among both rural and urban residents in the study period, from 109 per 10,000 childbirth hospitalizations in 2007 to 152 per 10,000 in 2015. When we controlled for sociodemographic factors and clinical conditions, we found that rural residents had a 9 percent greater probability of severe maternal morbidity and mortality, compared with urban residents. Attention to the challenges faced by rural patients and health care facilities is crucial to the success of efforts to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality in rural areas. These challenges include both clinical factors (workforce shortages, low patient volume, and the opioid epidemic) and social determinants of health (transportation, housing, poverty, food security, racism, violence, and trauma).",
        "New oncology therapies can contribute to survival or quality of life, but payers and policy makers have raised concerns about the cost of these therapies. Similar concerns extend beyond cancer. In seeking a solution, payers are increasingly turning toward value-based payment models in which providers take financial risk for costs and outcomes. These models, including episode payment and bundled payment, create financial gains for providers who reduce cost, but they also create concerns about potential stinting on necessary treatments. One approach, which the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services adopted in the Oncology Care Model (OCM), is to partially adjust medical practices\u2019 budgets for their use of novel therapies, defined in this case as new oncology drugs or new indications for existing drugs approved after December 31, 2014. In an analysis of the OCM novel therapies adjustment using historical Medicare claims data, we found that the adjustment may provide important financial protection for practices. In a simulation we performed, the adjustment reduced the average loss per treatment episode by $758 (from $807 to $49) for large practices that use novel therapies often. Lessons from the OCM can have implications for other alternative payment models.",
        "With a population of forty million and substantial geographic variation in sociodemographics and health services, California is an important setting in which to study disparities. Its population (37.5 percent White, 39.1 percent Latino, 5.3 percent Black, and 14.4 percent Asian) experienced 59,258 COVID-19 deaths through April 14, 2021-the most of any state. We analyzed California's racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 exposure risks, testing rates, test positivity, and case rates through October 2020, combining data from 15.4 million SARS-CoV-2 tests with subcounty exposure risk estimates from the American Community Survey. We defined \"high-exposure-risk\" households as those with one or more essential workers and fewer rooms than inhabitants. Latino people in California are 8.1 times more likely to live in high-exposure-risk households than White people (23.6 percent versus 2.9 percent), are overrepresented in cumulative cases (3,784 versus 1,112 per 100,000 people), and are underrepresented in cumulative testing (35,635 versus 48,930 per 100,000 people). These risks and outcomes were worse for Latino people than for members of other racial/ethnic minority groups. Subcounty disparity analyses can inform targeting of interventions and resources, including community-based testing and vaccine access measures. Tracking COVID-19 disparities and developing equity-focused public health programming that mitigates the effects of systemic racism can help improve health outcomes among California's populations of color.",
        "The effect of HIV treatment on hospitalization rates for HIV-infected people has never been established. We quantified this effect in a rural South African community for the period 2009\u201313. We linked clinical data on HIV treatment start dates for more than 2,000 patients receiving care in the public-sector treatment program with five years of longitudinal data on self-reported hospitalizations from a community-based population cohort of more than 100,000 adults. Hospitalization rates peaked during the first year of treatment and were about five times higher, compared to hospitalization rates after four years on treatment. Earlier treatment initiation could save more than US$300,000 per 1,000 patients over the first four years of HIV treatment, freeing up scarce resources. Future studies on the cost-effectiveness of HIV treatment should include these effects.",
        "The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted mental health services delivery across the US, but the extent and implications of these disruptions are unclear. This retrospective observational analysis used the claims clearinghouse Office Ally to compare outpatient mental health services use from March to December 2016\u201318 against use during the same period in 2020. We identified encounters for people ages twelve and older with primary diagnosis codes corresponding to mental health conditions and categorized encounters as in-person or telehealth, using Current Procedural Terminology and place-of-service codes. In-person mental health encounters were reduced by half in the early months of the pandemic, with rapid recovery of service delivery attributable to telehealth uptake (accounting for 47.9 percent of average monthly encounters). We found variation in the degree to which telehealth use increased across groups: People with schizophrenia made up a lower proportion of telehealth encounters relative to in-person visits (1.7 percent versus 2.7 percent), whereas those with anxiety and fear-related disorders accounted for a higher proportion (27.5 percent versus 25.5 percent). These findings highlight the importance of broadening access to services through new modalities without supplanting necessary in-person care for certain groups.",
        "The Affordable Care Act allows commercial insurers participating in the Marketplaces to vary the size of their provider networks as long as the providers are \"sufficient\" in numbers and types. Concerns have been growing over the increasing use of restricted-provider or narrow networks in Marketplace plans because of their implications for reduced access to care, but little is known about the breadth and stability of these networks over time or what types of enrollees choose such plans. Using national data, we found that in 2016, 60 percent of provider networks in plans offered in the federally facilitated Marketplaces included at least one-quarter of local-area physicians, and that consumers' access to broad-network plans remained stable between 2015 and 2016. Hispanic and low-income people made up a disproportionate share of enrollees in smaller-network plans (those with fewer than one-quarter of local-area physicians). It will be important to monitor the impact of narrow networks on access to and quality of care as well as on health outcomes.",
        "Proposals for expanding Medicare insurance coverage to uninsured Americans approaching the Medicare eligibility age of sixty-five has been the subject of intense debate. We undertook this study to assess cancer survival differences between uninsured patients younger than age sixty-five and older Medicare beneficiaries by using data from the National Cancer Database from the period 2004\u201316. The main outcomes were survival at one, two, and five years for sixteen cancer types in 1,206,821 patients. We found that uninsured patients ages 60\u201364 were nearly twice as likely to present with late-stage disease and were significantly less likely to receive surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy than Medicare beneficiaries ages 66\u201369, despite lower comorbidity among younger patients. Compared with older Medicare patients, younger uninsured patients had strikingly lower five-year survival across cancer types. For instance, five-year survival in younger uninsured patients with late-stage breast or prostate cancer was 5\u201317 percent lower than that among older Medicare patients. We conclude that survival after a diagnosis of cancer is considerably lower in younger uninsured patients than in older Medicare patients. Expanding comprehensive health insurance coverage to people approaching Medicare age eligibility may improve cancer outcomes in the US.",
        "In 2014 many uninsured, low-income nonelderly adults gained access to health insurance in states that expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act. Federally funded community health centers were likely to be particularly affected by this expansion because many of their patients were uninsured and low income. We used a difference-in-differences approach to compare changes among 1,057 such centers in expansion versus nonexpansion states from 2011 to 2014, in terms of their patients\u2019 insurance coverage, the number of patients they served, and the quality of care they provided. Medicaid expansion was associated with large increases (12 percentage points) in Medicaid coverage and corresponding declines (11 percentage points) in uninsurance rates. The numbers of patients served increased in both expansion and nonexpansion states, and the magnitude of increase did not differ significantly between the groups of states. Medicaid expansion was associated with improved quality on four of eight measures examined: asthma treatment, Pap testing, body mass index assessment, and hypertension control. This analysis suggests that states\u2019 decisions about Medicaid expansion have important consequences for health center patients, with expansion improving treatment and outcomes of chronic disease and bolstering the use of recommended preventive services.",
        "Health status and academic achievement have been found to be linked: When students have poor health status, they are at increased risk for poor academic outcomes. The school-based health center is a delivery model that supports improved access to health care, as well as healthy behaviors and outcomes, for students. Interact for Health is a private foundation that has provided funding to open school-based health centers in the Greater Cincinnati, Ohio, area since 1999. This article outlines grant-making strategies and effective policies that the foundation has identified as most conducive to creating sustainable school-based health centers. These include identification of the right partners, development of a business plan, and guidelines and policies that support long-term financial sustainability.",
        "The extent of price variation across a local market has important implications for value-based purchasing. Using a new data set containing health care prices for nearly every insurer-provider-service triad across a large local market, we comprehensively examined variation in fee-for-service paid commercial prices in Massachusetts for 291 predominantly outpatient medical services. Prices varied considerably across hospital service areas. Prices for medical services at acute hospitals were, on average, 76 percent higher than at all other providers. The service categories with the widest price variation were ambulance/transportation services, physical/occupational therapy, and laboratory/pathology testing. In this market, simulations suggested that steering patients toward lower-price providers or setting price ceilings could generate potential savings of 9.0-12.8 percent. Marketwide price information at the insurer-provider-service level could help target policy interventions to reduce health care spending.",
        "To improve health care quality and decrease costs, both the public and private sectors continue to make substantial investments in the transformation of primary care. Central to these efforts is the patient-centered medical home model (PCMH) and the adoption and meaningful use of health information technology (IT). We used 2018 national family medicine data to provide a perspective on the implementation of PCMH and health IT elements in a variety of US physician practices. We found that 95 percent of family medicine\u2013affiliated practices used electronic health records (EHRs) in 2018, but there was wide variation in whether those EHRs met meaningful-use criteria. Federally qualified health centers and military clinics were significantly more likely than other settings to have adopted PCMH elements. Adoption of PCMH elements was lowest among independently owned practices, which make up one-third of the primary care delivery system. Our findings suggest that achieving PCMH transformation across all types of practices will require a coordinated approach that aligns strong financial incentives with tailored technical assistance, an approach similar both to that used in federally qualified health centers over the past decade and to that used to drive EHR adoption a decade ago.",
        "Racism is not always conscious, explicit, or readily visible-often it is systemic and structural. Systemic and structural racism are forms of racism that are pervasively and deeply embedded in systems, laws, written or unwritten policies, and entrenched practices and beliefs that produce, condone, and perpetuate widespread unfair treatment and oppression of people of color, with adverse health consequences. Examples include residential segregation, unfair lending practices and other barriers to home ownership and accumulating wealth, schools' dependence on local property taxes, environmental injustice, biased policing and sentencing of men and boys of color, and voter suppression policies. This article defines systemic and structural racism, using examples; explains how they damage health through many causal pathways; and suggests approaches to dismantling them. Because systemic and structural racism permeate all sectors and areas, addressing them will require mutually reinforcing actions in multiple sectors and places; acknowledging their existence is a crucial first step.",
        "Achieving an interoperable health care system remains a top US policy priority. Despite substantial efforts to encourage interoperability, the first set of national data in 2014 suggested that hospitals' engagement levels were low. With 2015 data now available, we examined the first national trends in engagement in four domains of interoperability: finding, sending, receiving, and integrating electronic patient information from outside providers. We found small gains, with 29.7 percent of hospitals engaging in all four domains in 2015 compared to 24.5 percent in 2014. The two domains with the most progress were sending (with an increase of 8.1 percentage points) and receiving (an increase of 8.4 percentage points) information, while there was no change in integrating systems. Hospitals' use for patient care of data from outside providers was low, with only 18.7 percent of hospitals reporting that they \"often\" used these data. Our results reveal that hospitals' progress toward interoperability is slow and that progress is focused on moving information between hospitals, not on ensuring usability of information in clinical decisions.",
        "Health care systems worldwide are facing macro-scale changes involving advanced illness and end-of-life care that could affect both the quality of care and the quality of life for patients and their caregivers. For example, growth in mortality from cancer and Alzheimer disease, along with the increased prevalence of multiple morbidities for those near the end of life, raise questions about how the health system will provide adequate care and pain relief for patients, and addresses the needs of their caregivers-many of whom are unpaid family members. In addition, despite a growing tendency for people to prefer hospice and other lower-intensity options to cope with advanced illness and the relatively small share of excess spending that goes to individuals near the end of life, cost remains a concern. This is particularly true in the United States, where per capita medical spending in the last twelve months of life is $80,000-substantially higher than in comparable developed nations.",
        "Cost containment for dual-eligible beneficiaries (those enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid) is a key policy goal, but few studies have examined spending trends for this population. We contrasted growth in Medicare fee-for-service per beneficiary spending for those with and without Medicaid in the period 2007\u201315. Relative to Medicare-only enrollees, dual-eligible beneficiaries consistently had higher overall Medicare spending levels; however, they experienced steeper declines in spending growth over the study period. These trends varied across populations of interest. For instance, dual-eligible beneficiaries ages sixty-five and older went from having annual spending growth rates that were 1.8 percentage points higher than Medicare-only beneficiaries in 2008 to rates that were 1.1 percentage points lower in 2015. Across population groups, long-term users of nursing home care had some of the highest spending growth rates, averaging 1.7\u20134.1 percent annually depending on age group and Medicaid participation. These findings have implications for value-based payment and other Medicare policies aimed at controlling spending for dual-eligible beneficiaries.",
        "Interventions that address socioeconomic determinants of health are receiving considerable attention from policy makers and health care executives. The interest is fueled in part by expected returns on investment. However, many current estimates of returns on investment are likely overestimated, because they are based on pre-post study designs that are susceptible to regression to the mean. We present a return-on-investment analysis that is based on a randomized controlled trial of Individualized Management for Patient-Centered Targets (IMPaCT), a standardized community health worker intervention that addresses unmet social needs for disadvantaged people. We found that every dollar invested in the intervention would return $2.47 to an average Medicaid payer within the fiscal year.",
        "In the past twenty years, twenty-eight states and the District of Columbia have passed some form of medical marijuana law. Using quarterly data on all fee-for-service Medicaid prescriptions in the period 2007-14, we tested the association between those laws and the average number of prescriptions filled by Medicaid beneficiaries. We found that the use of prescription drugs in fee-for-service Medicaid was lower in states with medical marijuana laws than in states without such laws in five of the nine broad clinical areas we studied. If all states had had a medical marijuana law in 2014, we estimated that total savings for fee-for-service Medicaid could have been $1.01 billion. These results are similar to those in a previous study we conducted, regarding the effects of medical marijuana laws on the number of prescriptions within the Medicare population. Together, the studies suggest that in states with such laws, Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries will fill fewer prescriptions.",
        "Medicare for All has emerged as a major topic in the national health reform debate. A clear understanding of the policy issues raised by Medicare for All would benefit both public discussion and policy design. In this article we identify key policy design issues for a Medicare for All system: comprehensiveness of coverage, the private sector's role, the payment approach, and financing. We analyze policy options within these domains and show that the Medicare for All bills under consideration in the 116th Congress propose a comprehensive benefit structure with a limited role for supplementary private insurance. We suggest that Medicare for All could adopt payment rates between existing Medicare rates and the average all-payer rate, or it could implement global payment starting at a level similar to current spending. We propose a financing framework that includes repurposing existing public funds, redirecting private health care spending to public spending, and implementing a mix of progressive taxes to replace the regressive financing of private insurance.",
        "The extent to which recent large increases in hospitals' adoption of electronic health record (EHR) systems can be attributed to the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act of 2009 is uncertain and debated. Because only short-term acute care hospitals were eligible for the act's meaningful-use incentive program, we used national hospital data to examine the differential effect of HITECH on EHR adoption among eligible and ineligible hospitals in the periods before (2008-10) and after (2011-15) implementation of the program. We found that annual increases in EHR adoption rates among eligible hospitals went from 3.2 percent in the pre period to 14.2 percent in the post period. Ineligible hospitals experienced much smaller annual increases of 0.1 percent in the pre period and 3.3 percent in the post period, a significant difference-in-differences of 7.9 percentage points. Our results support the argument that recent gains in EHR adoption can be attributed specifically to HITECH, which suggests that the act could serve as a model for ways to drive the adoption of other valuable technologies.",
        "Improving communication about goals and values for patients with advancing serious illness nearing the end of life is a key opportunity to improve the value of care. The Serious Illness Care Program, implemented at primary care clinics affiliated with Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, is a multicomponent intervention designed to support best practices in communication by clinicians to increase conversations with patients with serious illness about their goals and values. We conducted a study of the program in fourteen primary care clinics participating in a high-risk care management program based in an accountable care organization. Patients in the clinics with the program implemented were more likely than those in comparison clinics to have serious illness conversations-including discussion of values and goals-documented in patients' medical records. Clinicians who participated also reported high satisfaction with training they received as part of the program, which they regarded as effective. This work suggests that the Serious Illness Care Program promotes more and better conversations among selected primary care patients, and it highlights the need for further research.",
        "Primary care physicians in the US, like their colleagues in several other high-income countries, are increasingly tasked with coordinating services delivered not just by specialists and hospitals but also by home care professionals and social service agencies. To inform efforts to improve care coordination, the 2019 Commonwealth Fund International Health Policy Survey of Primary Care Physicians queried primary care physicians in eleven high-income countries about their ability to coordinate patients' medical care with specialists, across settings of care, and with social service providers. Compared to physicians in other countries, substantial proportions of US physicians did not routinely receive timely notification or the information needed for managing ongoing care from specialists, after-hours care centers, emergency departments, or hospitals. Primary care practices in a handful of countries, including the US, are not routinely exchanging information electronically outside the practice. Top-performing countries demonstrate the feasibility of improving two-way communication between primary care and other sites of care. The surveyed countries share the challenge of coordinating with social service providers, and the results call for solutions to support primary care physicians.",
        "Unhealthy alcohol use in the military remains a serious threat to health and military readiness and raises the question of how to improve detection that facilitates diagnosis and treatment. Army active duty soldiers are routinely screened for possible alcohol use disorder in pre- and post-deployment health surveillance surveys. We examined the likelihood of having a follow-up behavioral health visit or receiving an alcohol use disorder diagnosis among soldiers returning from deployments associated with the Afghanistan or Iraq operations in fiscal years 2008\u201313, based on their post-deployment screening results. After we controlled for demographic and military treatment facility characteristics, military history, and comorbidities, we found that people who screened positive for possible alcohol use disorder were significantly more likely to have such a visit and receive such a diagnosis. Routine post-deployment alcohol screening represents an opportunity for timely intervention by the Military Health System for military members whose results indicate elevated risk for alcohol use disorder.",
        "Consolidation of physician practices by hospitals, or vertical integration, increased across all practice types in 2007\u201317. Rates of growth were highest among medical and surgical specialty practices and lowest among primary care practices. There was substantial variation within the specialties, ranging from 4 percentage points in dermatology to 34 percentage points in cardiology and oncology.",
        "Differences in income between male and female academic physicians are well known, but differences for community physicians and career differences in income have not been quantified. We used earnings data from 80,342 full-time US physicians to estimate career differences in income between men and women. The differences in annual income between male and female physicians that we observed in our simulations increased most rapidly during the initial years of practice. Over the course of a simulated forty-year career, male physicians earned an average adjusted gross income of $8,307,327 compared with an average of $6,263,446 for female physicians\u2014an absolute adjusted difference of $2,043,881 and relative difference of 24.6 percent. Gender differences in career earnings were largest for surgical specialists ($2.5 million difference), followed by nonsurgical specialists ($1.6 million difference) and primary care physicians ($0.9 million difference). These findings imply that over the course of a career, female US physicians were estimated to earn, on average, more than $2 million less than male US physicians after adjustment for factors that may otherwise explain observed differences in income, such as hours worked, clinical revenue, practice type, and specialty.",
        "Major policy uncertainty continues to surround the Affordable Care Act (ACA) at both the state and federal levels. We assessed changes in health care use and self-reported health after three years of the ACA\u2019s coverage expansion, using survey data collected from low-income adults through the end of 2016 in three states: Kentucky, which expanded Medicaid; Arkansas, which expanded private insurance to low-income adults using the federal Marketplace; and Texas, which did not expand coverage. We used a difference-in-differences model with a control group and an instrumental variables model to provide individual-level estimates of the effects of gaining insurance. By the end of 2016 the uninsurance rate in the two expansion states had dropped by more than 20 percentage points relative to the nonexpansion state. For uninsured people gaining coverage, this change was associated with a 41-percentage-point increase in having a usual source of care, a $337 reduction in annual out-of-pocket spending, significant increases in preventive health visits and glucose testing, and a 23-percentage-point increase in \u201cexcellent\u201d self-reported health. Among adults with chronic conditions, we found improvements in affordability of care, regular care for those conditions, medication adherence, and self-reported health.",
        "Delivering food to nutritionally vulnerable patients is important for addressing these patients\u2019 social determinants of health. However, it is not known whether food delivery programs can reduce the use of costly health services and decrease medical spending among these patients. We sought to determine whether home delivery of either medically tailored meals or nontailored food reduces the use of selected health care services and medical spending in a sample of adults dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. Compared with matched nonparticipants, participants had fewer emergency department visits in both the medically tailored meal program and the nontailored food program. Participants in the medically tailored meal program also had fewer inpatient admissions and lower medical spending. Participation in the nontailored food program was not associated with fewer inpatient admissions but was associated with lower medical spending. These findings suggest the potential for meal delivery programs to reduce the use of costly health care and decrease spending for vulnerable patients.",
        "In 2014\u2014after the implementation of most of the Affordable Care Act provisions, including Medicaid expansions in some states and subsidies to purchase Marketplace coverage in all states\u2014adults who had been uninsured for more than three years represented a larger share of the newly insured, compared to adults who had been insured for shorter periods of time.",
        "This article estimates changes in all-cause mortality due to the COVID-19 pandemic by socioeconomic characteristics and occupation for nonelderly adults in the US, using large-scale, national survey data linked to administrative mortality records. Mortality increases were largest for adults living in correctional facilities or in health care\u2013related group quarters, those without health insurance coverage, those with family incomes below the federal poverty level, and those in occupations with limited work-from-home options. For almost all subgroups, mortality increases were higher among non-Hispanic Black respondents than among non-Hispanic White respondents. Hispanic respondents with health insurance, those not living in group quarters, those with work-from-home options, and those in essential industries also experienced larger increases in mortality during the COVID-19 crisis compared with non-Hispanic Whites in those categories. Occupations that experienced the largest mortality increases were related to installation, maintenance, and repair and production. This research highlights the relevance of individual economic, social, and demographic characteristics during the COVID-19 crisis.",
        "Under current law, national health expenditures are projected to grow at an average annual rate of 5.6 percent for 2016-25 and represent 19.9 percent of gross domestic product by 2025. For 2016, national health expenditure growth is anticipated to have slowed 1.1 percentage points to 4.8 percent, as a result of slower Medicaid and prescription drug spending growth. For the rest of the projection period, faster projected growth in medical prices is partly offset by slower projected growth in the use and intensity of medical goods and services, relative to that observed in 2014-16 associated with the Affordable Care Act coverage expansions. The insured share of the population is projected to increase from 90.9 percent in 2015 to 91.5 percent by 2025.",
        "Eight years after the US Supreme Court's landmark decision in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, more than two million of the nation's poorest working-age adults continue to feel its effects. These are the people who, because of the decision, remain without a pathway to affordable health insurance coverage because they live in a state that has not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Closing the coverage gap created by NFIB v. Sebelius represents the ACA's most pressing piece of unfinished business. Several options, which vary in cost and political complexity, exist for closing the gap in ways that respect the ACA's pluralistic approach to insurance coverage while adhering to constitutional principles. These considerations must be balanced against the urgency of the problem and the fact that, constitutionally speaking, Medicaid alone can no longer guarantee a national remedy to the fundamental issue of health insurance inequality for the poorest Americans.",
        "Between 2008 and 2018, six states and Washington, D.C., began contracting with enrollment brokers to facilitate enrollment into Medicaid, joining the eighteen states that already had such contracts in place as of 2008. Using newly collected data covering all contracts between state Medicaid agencies and independent enrollment brokers during this period, we compared changes in Medicaid participation following the initiation of contracts with enrollment brokers with contemporaneous changes in Medicaid participation in states that never contracted with brokers. We found that contract initiation had no statistically significant effects on state-level Medicaid participation. We further found no evidence of other enrollment-related benefits, such as improved application processing times.",
        "The Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires biomedical companies to report payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Despite significant attention paid to industry payments to physicians, little is known about payments to teaching hospitals, which create the potential for both benefits and institutional conflicts of interest. We examined 2018 CMS Open Payments program data to identify all nonresearch payments made by industry to teaching hospitals and determined that 91 percent of teaching hospitals received industry payments totaling $832 million in 2018. We observed substantial royalty payments, which may reflect the downstream benefits of research partnerships, as well as substantial payments for gifts and education, which raise concerns for institutional conflicts of interest. Hospital predictors of receiving payments included large bed size, major medical school affiliation, and inclusion on the U.S. News & World Report Best Hospitals Honor Roll. Financial payments from industry to teaching hospitals are common and previously underrecognized. Hospitals should strengthen policies to prevent the institutional conflicts of interest that may arise from these payments while promoting beneficial industry collaborations. We also suggest that CMS reporting requirements be broadened to all hospitals to meet the Sunshine Act\u2019s goals of encouraging transparency and preventing inappropriate industry influence.",
        "Medicare\u2019s Accountable Care Organization (ACO) Investment Model (AIM) provided up-front funding to forty-one small, rurally located ACOs to encourage their participation in the Medicare Shared Savings Program. We estimate net savings to Medicare of $381.5 million over three years, driven by utilization reductions in inpatient and other institutional care and by the absence of shared risk for potential increases in Medicare spending incurred by participants. These savings suggest that population-based payment models can enable providers to better meet the needs of rural populations through greater flexibility in care delivery. However, nearly two-thirds of AIM ACOs exited the Medicare Shared Savings Program when faced with the requirement to assume downside financial risk, starting in year four of participation. As the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services builds on AIM and rural hospital global payment models, our findings suggest that new payment models can support more efficient use of resources to meet the health care needs of rural populations. However, the findings also caution against the vigorous pursuit of savings as a primary goal of payment models in traditionally underserved communities.",

        "State prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) aim to reduce risky controlled-substance prescribing, but early programs had limited impact. Several states implemented robust features in 2012\u201313, such as mandates that prescribers register with the program and regularly check its registry database. Some states allow prescribers to fulfill the latter requirement by designating delegates to check the registry. The effects of robust PDMP features have not been fully assessed. We used commercial claims data to examine the effects of implementing robust PDMPs in four states on overall and high-risk opioid prescribing, comparing those results to trends in similar states without robust PDMPs. By the end of 2014 the absolute mean morphine-equivalent dosages that providers dispensed declined in a range of 6\u201377 mg per person per quarter in the four states, relative to comparison states. Only in one of the four states, Kentucky, did the percentage of people who filled opioid prescriptions decline versus its comparator state, with an absolute reduction of 1.6 percent by the end of 2014. Robust PDMPs may be able to significantly reduce opioid dosages dispensed, percentages of patients receiving opioids, and high-risk prescribing.",

Premium increases over time have exacerbated the discrepancy in premium prices based on tobacco use.",
        "High-value primary care for high-needs patients\u2014those with multiple physical, mental, or behavioral health conditions\u2014is critical to improving health system performance. However, little is known about what types of physician practices perform best for high-needs patients. We examined two scale-related characteristics that could predict how well physician practices delivered care to this population: the proportion of patients in the practice that were high-needs and practice size (number of physicians). Using four years of data on commercially insured, high-needs patients in Michigan primary care practices, we found lower spending and utilization among practices with a higher proportion of high-needs patients (more than 10 percent of the practice\u2019s panel) compared to practices with smaller proportions. Small practices (those with one or two physicians) had lower overall spending, but not less utilization, compared to large practices. However, practices with a substantial proportion of high-needs patients, as well as small practices, performed slightly worse on a composite measure of process quality than their associated reference group. Practices that treat a high proportion of high-needs patients might have structural advantages or have developed specialized approaches to serve this population. If so, this raises questions about how best to make use of this knowledge to foster high-value care for high-needs patients.",
        "State and local governments imposed social distancing measures in March and April 2020 to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). These measures included bans on large social gatherings; school closures; closures of entertainment venues, gyms, bars, and restaurant dining areas; and shelter-in-place orders. We evaluated the impact of these measures on the growth rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases across US counties between March 1, 2020, and April 27, 2020. An event study design allowed each policy's impact on COVID-19 case growth to evolve over time. Adoption of government-imposed social distancing measures reduced the daily growth rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases by 5.4 percentage points after one to five days, 6.8 percentage points after six to ten days, 8.2 percentage points after eleven to fifteen days, and 9.1 percentage points after sixteen to twenty days. Holding the amount of voluntary social distancing constant, these results imply that there would have been ten times greater spread of COVID-19 by April 27 without shelter-in-place orders (ten million cases) and more than thirty-five times greater spread without any of the four measures (thirty-five million cases). Our article illustrates the potential danger of exponential spread in the absence of interventions, providing information relevant to strategies for restarting economic activity.",
        "An analysis of data for 2014 about forty-four low-value health services in the Virginia All Payer Claims Database revealed more than $586 million in unnecessary costs. Among these low-value services, those that were low and very low cost ($538 or less per service) were delivered far more frequently than services that were high and very high cost ($539 or more). The combined costs of the former group were nearly twice those of the latter (65 percent versus 35 percent).",
        "The Comprehensive End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Care (CEC) Model was the first Medicare specialty-oriented accountable care organization (ACO) model. We examined whether this model provided better results for beneficiaries with ESRD than primary care\u2013based ACO models. We found significant decreases in Medicare payments ($126 per beneficiary per month), hospitalizations (5 percent), and likelihood of readmissions (8 percent) among beneficiaries with ESRD during the first year of alignment with the CEC Model and no impacts on these measures among beneficiaries with ESRD who were aligned with primary care\u2013based ACOs, relative to fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries. Neither the CEC nor primary care\u2013based ACO models significantly reduced the likelihood of catheter use, but fistula use increased for CEC Model beneficiaries to levels just above statistical significance. Other populations with chronic conditions may benefit from the testing of a specialty-oriented ACO model. In addition, primary care\u2013based ACOs may benefit from applying CEC Model strategies to high-need subpopulations. Last, the strategies that enabled ESRD Seamless Care Organizations to achieve reductions in hospitalizations and readmissions even without hospital participation as owners could inform physician-led ACOs\u2019 efforts to coordinate with hospitals in their areas.",
        "Proponents of hospital-based observation care argue that it has the potential to reduce health care spending and lengths-of-stay, compared to short-stay inpatient hospitalizations. However, critics have raised concerns about the out-of-pocket spending associated with observation care. Recent reports of high out-of-pocket spending among Medicare beneficiaries have received considerable media attention and have prompted direct policy changes. Despite the potential for changed policies to indirectly affect non-Medicare patients, little is known about the use of, and spending associated with, observation care among commercially insured populations. Using multipayer commercial claims for the period 2009\u201313, we evaluated utilization and spending among patients admitted for six conditions that are commonly managed with either observation care or short-stay hospitalizations. In our study period, the use of observation care increased relative to that of short-stay hospitalizations. Total and out-of-pocket spending were substantially lower for observation care, though both grew rapidly\u2014and at rates much higher than spending in the inpatient setting\u2014over the study period. Despite this growth, spending on observation care is unlikely to exceed spending for short-stay hospitalizations. As observation care attracts greater attention, policy makers should be aware that Medicare policies that disincentivize observation may have unintended financial impacts on non-Medicare populations, where observation care may be cost saving.",
        "The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), the largest refundable tax credit for low-to-middle-income US families with children, has been shown to improve maternal and child health and reduce public spending on health. However, many eligible families do not receive it. This study used 2014 Survey of Income and Program Participation data to explore predictors of EITC receipt among Hispanic families, an understudied segment of the eligible population. We found lower likelihoods of receipt among Hispanic income-eligible families, even those who were eligible US citizens by naturalization, compared with their peers. Parent self-employment and lower English language proficiency were also associated with lower EITC receipt. With new data collected on state policies, we found that states\u2019 granting of drivers\u2019 licenses to undocumented people, availability of government information in Spanish, and employer mandates to inform employees were associated with greater EITC receipt among all income-eligible families, including Hispanic families. These findings showcase ways in which information and outreach at the state level can support the equitable receipt of tax refunds and similar types of benefits distributed through the tax system.",
        "We examined changes in hospital uncompensated care costs in the context of Louisiana's Medicaid expansion. Louisiana remains the only state in the Deep South to have expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act and can serve as a model for states that have not adopted expansion, many of which are located in the South census region. We found that Medicaid expansion was associated with a 33 percent reduction in the share of total operating expenses attributable to uncompensated care costs for general medical and surgical hospitals in Louisiana in the first three years after expansion. Reductions varied by hospital type, with larger effects found for rural and public hospitals versus urban and for-profit or private nonprofit hospitals. As hospital operating expenses consistently increased during the sample period, our results imply that hospitals in Louisiana are treating fewer patients for whom no reimbursement was provided since the state expanded Medicaid.",
        "Youth in underserved communities lack access to consistent sources of high-quality health care. School-based health centers (SBHCs) address this challenge through the provision of primary care, mental health care, and other health services in schools. This article describes the current status of SBHCs nationally, including changes over the past twenty years. Data were collected through the School-Based Health Alliance\u2019s National School-Based Health Care Census. The number of SBHCs doubled from 1,135 in 1998\u201399 to 2,584 in 2016\u201317. During this time they adapted to the changing health care landscape and community needs. Sponsorship shifted predominantly to federally qualified health centers, and SBHCs provided access to primary care and, often, to mental, oral, and other health services to 10,629 schools and over 6.3 million students. SBHCs have grown steadily since 1998, and recent expansion through federally qualified health centers and telehealth technology forecasts even greater growth, innovation, and access for underserved communities.",
        "The movement to promote a culture of health bears many similarities to another large-scale and ambitious effort from more than fifty years ago: President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty. Long a target of critics of all ideological persuasions, the War on Poverty, through its heritage, offers an instructive precedent for champions of the culture of health movement. This essay examines two regional-level War on Poverty health endeavors, one each in New York City and Los Angeles. They show the influence the War on Poverty had on the ground in widening the health care safety net, implementing holistic models of care, and facilitating community involvement in the leadership of larger health care institutions.",
        "The California drug transparency bill (SB-17), signed into law in October 2017, seeks to promote transparency in pharmaceutical pricing, enhance understanding about pharmaceutical pricing trends, and assist in managing pharmaceutical costs. This article examines the legal and regulatory aspects of SB-17, explores legal challenges to the law, compares it to other state efforts to address rising drug prices, and discusses how California can maximize the impact of SB-17 by coupling the law with other incentives. While SB-17 might not significantly reduce drug prices, the new law represents a meaningful step for one state seeking to negotiate the political and legal boundaries of state action to rein in drug prices.",
        "Antibiotic-resistant infections are a global health care concern. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 23,000 Americans with these infections die each year. Rising infection rates add to the costs of health care and compromise the quality of medical and surgical procedures provided. Little is known about the national health care costs attributable to treating the infections. Using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, we estimated the incremental health care costs of treating a resistant infection as well as the total national costs of treating such infections. To our knowledge, this is the first national estimate of the costs for treating the infections. We found that antibiotic resistance added $1,383 to the cost of treating a patient with a bacterial infection. Using our estimate of the number of such infections in 2014, this amounts to a national cost of $2.2 billion annually. The need for innovative new infection prevention programs, antibiotics, and vaccines to prevent and treat antibiotic-resistant infections is an international priority.",
        "As the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic spreads throughout the United States, evidence is mounting that racial and ethnic minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups are bearing a disproportionate burden of illness and death. We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of COVID-19 patients at Sutter Health, a large integrated health system in northern California, to measure potential disparities. We used Sutter's integrated electronic health record to identify adults with suspected and confirmed COVID-19, and we used multivariable logistic regression to assess risk of hospitalization, adjusting for known risk factors, such as race/ethnicity, sex, age, health, and socioeconomic variables. We analyzed 1,052 confirmed cases of COVID-19 from the period January 1\u2013April 8, 2020. Among our findings, we observed that compared with non-Hispanic white patients, non-Hispanic African American patients had 2.7 times the odds of hospitalization, after adjustment for age, sex, comorbidities, and income. We explore possible explanations for this, including societal factors that either result in barriers to timely access to care or create circumstances in which patients view delaying care as the most sensible option. Our study provides real-world evidence of racial and ethnic disparities in the presentation of COVID-19.",
        "An important function of health insurance is protecting enrollees from excessively burdensome charges for unanticipated medical events. Unexpected surgery can be financially catastrophic for uninsured people. By targeting the low-income uninsured population, Medicaid expansion had the potential to reduce the financial risks associated with these events. We used two data sources (state-level data for forty-four states and patient-level data for four states) to estimate the association of Medicaid expansion with uninsured surgical hospitalizations among nonelderly adults. Uninsured surgery cases were typically admitted through the emergency department\u2014often for common emergency procedures\u2014and 99 percent of them were estimated to be associated with financially catastrophic visit charges. We found that Medicaid expansion was associated with reductions in both the share (6.20 percent) and the population rate (7.85 per 10,000) of uninsured surgical discharges in expansion versus nonexpansion states. Our estimates suggest that in 2019 alone, adoption of Medicaid expansion in nonexpansion states could have prevented more than 50,000 incidences of catastrophic financial burden resulting from uninsured surgery.",
        "Addressing health inequities for racial and ethnic minority populations is challenging. After passage of the Affordable Care Act, Michigan launched its Healthy Michigan Plan, which expanded Medicaid eligibility in the state. Our evaluation of the expansion provided the opportunity to study its impact on racial and ethnic minority groups, including Arab American and Chaldean American enrollees, an understudied population. Using data from telephone surveys collected in 2016, 2017, and 2018, we conducted an analysis to study the plan\u2019s impact on access to a regular source of care and health status among racial and ethnic minority groups. More than 90 percent of respondents of all racial and ethnic groups reported having a regular source of care after plan enrollment compared with 74.4 percent before enrollment. Respondents who identified as non-Hispanic White, African American, and Hispanic reported improvements in health status after plan enrollment. Our study demonstrates the potential of health insurance access to narrow health inequities between racial and ethnic groups.",
        "An up-to-date assessment of environmental emissions in the US health care sector is essential to help policy makers hold the health care industry accountable to protect public health. We update national-level US health-sector emissions. We also estimate state-level emissions for the first time and examine associations with state-level energy systems and health care quality and access metrics. Economywide modeling showed that US health care greenhouse gas emissions rose 6 percent from 2010 to 2018, reaching 1,692 kg per capita in 2018-the highest rate among industrialized nations. In 2018 greenhouse gas and toxic air pollutant emissions resulted in the loss of 388,000 disability-adjusted life-years. There was considerable variation in state-level greenhouse gas emissions per capita, which were not highly correlated with health system quality. These results suggest that the health care sector's outsize environmental footprint can be reduced without compromising quality. To reduce harmful emissions, the health care sector should decrease unnecessary consumption of resources, decarbonize power generation, and invest in preventive care. This will likely require mandatory reporting, benchmarking, and regulated accountability of health care organizations.",
        "Disability levels in the United States declined during the 1980s and 1990s, but these declines stalled more recently. Using data for 2013 from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, we estimated the percentages of national and state disability that could be prevented through reductions in five modifiable health risk factors associated with disability: cigarette smoking, obesity, diabetes, high cholesterol, and hypertension. Taking into account risk-factor prevalence and the association between each risk factor and disability, we evaluated the fraction of disability preventable if risk factors were reduced under two scenarios: complete elimination of risk factors and reduction in all states to the lowest levels observed in states. If all five risk factors were eliminated, 53 percent of disability could be prevented nationally. The largest contributors were smoking (17 percent), obesity (16 percent), and hypertension (12 percent). If all states reduced risk-factor levels to the lowest observed levels, up to 7 percent of disability could be prevented nationally. Many states in the South and Midwest could experience disability reductions of more than 10 percent by attaining the same risk-factor levels as in states that had the lowest levels. Improved risk-factor prevention could result in the resumption of longer-term declines in US disability.",
        "We used data for 2014-15 from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey to estimate standardized payments for nonelderly adults' physician office visits by type of insurance. Adults with public insurance, especially Medicaid, had substantially lower provider payments, out-of-pocket spending, and third-party payments than their peers with employer-sponsored or Marketplace insurance. Quantifying public-private payment differences can help clarify choices for financing health care among low-income Americans.",
        "The outcome of flourishing and its predictors have not been well documented among US children, especially those who face adversity. Using data for 2016 and 2017 from the National Survey of Children\u2019s Health, we determined the prevalence and predictors of flourishing among US children ages 6\u201317. A three-item index included indicators of flourishing: children\u2019s interest and curiosity in learning new things, persistence in completing tasks, and capacity to regulate emotions. The national prevalence of flourishing was 40.3 percent (29.9\u201345.0 percent across states). At each level of adverse childhood experiences, household income, and special health care needs, the prevalence of flourishing increased in a graded fashion with increasing levels of family resilience and connection. Across the sectors of health care, education, and human services, evidence-based programs and policies to increase family resilience and connection could increase flourishing in US children, even as society addresses remediable causes of childhood adversity.",
        "The COVID-19 pandemic has had a dramatic impact on the cross-border movement of people. As governments begin to reopen their borders and cautiously restart travel, their attention is shifting to border procedures that could facilitate travel while protecting the homeland from travelers who may be infected. This is not the first time in recent memory that border management has had to be rethought under the pressure of large external forces. This article examines parallels between the current situation and the early 2000s, when the September 11, 2001, attacks on US targets caused a seismic shift in managing borders. We find echoes of today's responses in the initial fragmentation and chaos of two decades ago, which eventually gave way to a coordinated international system. We also analyze the implications of the emerging border health infrastructure for other migration challenges\u2014particularly addressing irregular crossings and the border \"crises\" they create. Because the aftershocks of the pandemic on all aspects of people on the move could be felt for decades, immigration, mobility management, and public health priorities must be considered alongside one another.",
        "Charged with ensuring that research produces useful evidence to inform health decisions, the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) requires investigators to engage patients and other health care stakeholders, such as clinicians and payers, in the research process. Many PCORI studies result in articles published in peer-reviewed journals that detail research findings and engagement\u2019s role in research. To inform practices for engaging patients and others as research partners, we analyzed 126 articles that described engagement approaches and contributions to research. PCORI projects engaged patients and others as consultants and collaborators in determining the study design, selecting study outcomes, tailoring interventions to meet patients\u2019 needs and preferences, and enrolling participants. Many articles reported that engagement provided valuable contributions to research feasibility, acceptability, rigor, and relevance, while a few noted trade-offs of engagement. The findings suggest that engagement can support more relevant research through better alignment with patients\u2019 and clinicians\u2019 real-world needs and concerns.",
        "New Jersey's COVID-19 Temporary Emergency Reciprocity Licensure program provided temporary licenses to more than 31,000 out-of-state health care practitioners. As one of the first COVID-19 hot spots in the US, New Jersey is uniquely positioned to provide insights on enabling an out-of-state health care workforce through temporary licensure to address critical, ongoing concerns about health care workforce supply. In January 2021 we surveyed New Jersey temporary licensees. We analyzed more than 10,000 survey responses and found that practitioners who used the temporary license originated from every state in the US, provided both COVID-19- and non-COVID-19-related care, served a combination of new and existing patients, conversed with patients in at least thirty-six languages, and primarily used telehealth. Findings suggest that temporary licensure of out-of-state practitioners, along with telehealth waivers, may be a valuable, short-term solution to mitigating health care workforce shortages during public health emergencies.",
        "Recent closures of rural obstetric units and entire hospitals have exacerbated concerns about access to care for more than eighteen million women of reproductive age living in rural America. Yet the extent of recent obstetric unit closures has not yet been measured. Using national data, we found that 9 percent of rural counties experienced the loss of all hospital obstetric services in the period 2004\u201314. In addition, another 45 percent of rural US counties had no hospital obstetric services at all during the study period. That left more than half of all rural US counties without hospital obstetric services. Counties with fewer obstetricians and family physicians per women of reproductive age and per capita, respectively; a higher percentage of non-Hispanic black women of reproductive age; and lower median household incomes and those in states with more restrictive Medicaid income eligibility thresholds for pregnant women had higher odds of lacking hospital obstetric services. The same types of counties were also more likely to experience the loss of obstetric services, which highlights the challenge of providing adequate geographic access to obstetric care in vulnerable and underserved rural communities.",
        "Racial inequities in clinical performance diminish overall health care system performance; however, quality assessments have rarely incorporated reliable measures of racial inequities. We studied care for more than one million Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries with cancer to assess the feasibility of calculating reliable practice-level measures of racial inequities in chemotherapy-associated emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations. Specifically, we used hierarchical models to estimate adjusted practice-level Black-White differences in these events and described differences across practices. We calculated reliable inequity measures for 426 and 322 practices, depending on the measure. These practices reflected fewer than 10 percent of practices treating Medicare beneficiaries with chemotherapy, but they treated approximately half of all White and Black Medicare beneficiaries receiving chemotherapy and two-thirds of Black Medicare beneficiaries receiving chemotherapy. Black patients experienced chemotherapy-associated ED visits and hospitalizations at higher rates (54.2 percent and 35.8 percent, respectively) than White patients (45.7 percent and 31.9 percent, respectively). The median within-practice Black-White difference was 8.1 percentage points for chemotherapy-associated ED visits and 2.7 percentage points for chemotherapy-associated hospitalizations. Additional research is needed to identify other reliable measures of racial inequities in health care quality, measure care inequities in smaller practices, and assess whether providing practice-level feedback could improve equity.",
        "Time spent by physicians is a key resource in health care delivery. This study used data captured by the access time stamp functionality of an electronic health record (EHR) to examine physician work effort. This is a potentially powerful, yet unobtrusive, way to study physicians\u2019 use of time. We used data on physicians\u2019 time allocation patterns captured by over thirty-one million EHR transactions in the period 2011\u201314 recorded by 471 primary care physicians, who collectively worked on 765,129 patients\u2019 EHRs. Our results suggest that the physicians logged an average of 3.08 hours on office visits and 3.17 hours on desktop medicine each day. Desktop medicine consists of activities such as communicating with patients through a secure patient portal, responding to patients\u2019 online requests for prescription refills or medical advice, ordering tests, sending staff messages, and reviewing test results. Over time, log records from physicians showed a decline in the time allocated to face-to-face visits, accompanied by an increase in time allocated to desktop medicine. Staffing and scheduling in the physician\u2019s office, as well as provider payment models for primary care practice, should account for these desktop medicine efforts.",
        "By feeding more than thirty million schoolchildren daily, the National School Lunch Program's food offerings substantially influence a contributing factor to climate change: US food production methods. Modifying school lunch nutrition standards could be a policy strategy to reduce climate change while promoting human health. To estimate how school lunches could be adjusted to encourage both outcomes, we compared the composition of school lunches with the EAT-Lancet Commission's healthy reference diet science-based benchmarks for reducing food system impacts on climate change. Analyzing more than 5,000 lunches served in the US during school year 2014\u201315, we found that they exceeded EAT-Lancet targets for dairy, fruit, refined grains, red meat, and starchy vegetables while containing insufficient whole grains, legumes, vegetables, and nuts. In addition, estimated food costs were higher for school lunches than for lunches meeting EAT-Lancet targets. Our findings suggest that redesigning school lunches could provide high-quality nutrition while benefiting the environment and reducing food costs.",
        "No research has considered a range of physician practice capabilities for managing patient care when examining practice-level influences on quality of care, utilization, and spending. Using data from the 2017 National Survey of Healthcare Organizations and Systems linked to 2017 Medicare fee-for-service claims data from attributed beneficiaries, we examined the association of practice-level capabilities with process measures of quality, utilization, and spending. In propensity score\u2013weighted mixed-effects regression analyses, physician practice locations with \"robust\" capabilities had lower total spending compared to locations with \"mixed\" or \"limited\" capabilities. Quality and utilization, however, did not differ by practice-level capabilities. Physician practice locations with robust capabilities spend less on Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries but deliver quality of care that is comparable to the quality delivered in locations with low or mixed capabilities. Reforms beyond those targeting practice capabilities, including multipayer alignment and payment reform, may be needed to support larger performance advantages for practices with robust capabilities.",
        "The US Military Health System (MHS) provides universal access to health care for more than nine million eligible beneficiaries through direct care in military treatment facilities or purchased care in civilian facilities. Using information from linked cancer registry and administrative databases, we examined how care source contributed to cancer treatment cost variation in the MHS for patients ages 18-64 who were diagnosed with colon, female breast, or prostate cancer in the period 2003-14. After accounting for patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics, we found the independent contribution of care source to total variation in cost to be 8 percent, 12 percent, and 2 percent for colon, breast, and prostate cancer treatment, respectively. About 20-50 percent of the total cost variance remained unexplained and may be related to organizational and administrative factors.",
        "Although all state Medicaid programs cover children's dental care, Medicaid-eligible children are more likely to experience tooth decay than children in higher-income families. Using data from the 1999-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the 2003, 2007, and 2011-12 waves of the National Survey of Children's Health, we examined the association between Medicaid adult dental coverage (an optional benefit) and children's oral health. Adult dental coverage was associated with a statistically significant 5-percentage-point reduction in the prevalence of untreated caries among children after Medicaid-enrolled adults had access to coverage for at least one year. These policies were also associated with a reduction in parent-reported fair or poor child oral health with a two-year lag between the onset of the policy and the effect. Effects were concentrated among children younger than age twelve. We estimated declines in poor oral health among all racial and ethnic subgroups, although there was some evidence that non-Hispanic Black children experienced larger and more persistent effects than non-Hispanic White children. Future assessments of the costs and benefits of offering adult dental coverage may consider potential effects on the children of adult Medicaid enrollees.",
        "Federal and state policies to increase access to birth control have included expanding access to preventive and emergency hormonal contraception at pharmacies for women and girls of all ages without a physician's prescription. We conducted a \"mystery shopper\" telephone survey to quantify the impact of these policies in Los Angeles County, California. That county consistently has among the highest number of unintended pregnancies and teen births in the US, especially in low-income and minority neighborhoods. Between June and November 2017, three in four pharmacies offered over-the-counter emergency hormonal contraception, but only one in ten offered pharmacist-prescribed preventive hormonal contraception. Many of these pharmacies also imposed age restrictions when dispensing hormonal contraception, including in the neighborhoods at highest risk for unintended pregnancies and teen births, even though the Food and Drug Administration removed age restrictions for over-the-counter emergency hormonal contraception in 2013. In addition, many low-income, minority neighborhoods lacked pharmacies when the survey was performed. Policies aimed solely at expanding pharmacy access to birth control might not be sufficient to address disparities in contraceptive use.",
        "TRICARE provides health care benefits to nearly two million children of active duty, retired, National Guard, and reserve service members. Child health advocates and congressional reports have raised questions regarding the adequacy of these benefits, compared with other sources of children's health insurance. To help address these questions, we compared TRICARE benefits with benefits from Medicaid and Marketplace plans because they represent alternative sources of coverage for many of the families enrolled in TRICARE. Overall, we found that TRICARE benefits fell in the middle\u2014between Medicaid plans' more comprehensive benefits with no cost sharing and Marketplace plans' more restrictive benefits with higher cost sharing.",
        "To determine how low-income Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) adults gained health insurance coverage\u2014specifically, via Medicaid or private insurance\u2014under the Affordable Care Act, we used a difference-in-differences approach to compare uninsurance rates in 2010\u201313 and 2015\u201316. In Medicaid expansion states, adjusted Medicaid coverage gains were 9.67 percentage points larger than in nonexpansion states; however, adjusted private coverage gains in expansion states were 10.19 percentage points lower. These results indicate that, in contrast to the case for other racial/ethnic groups, for AANHPI the Medicaid coverage increases in expansion states were of similar magnitude to the private insurance coverage increases in nonexpansion states. Reasons for this may include differences in willingness to enroll in public versus private coverage, barriers related to language or citizenship status, or other factors. Future studies are needed to understand these patterns and promote health equity for this population.",
        "Medicaid programs responded to the opioid crisis by expanding treatment coverage and reforming delivery systems. We assessed whether Virginia's Addiction and Recovery Treatment Services (ARTS) program, implemented in April 2017, influenced emergency department and inpatient use. Using claims for January 2016-June 2018 and difference-in-differences models, we compared beneficiaries with opioid use disorder before and after ARTS implementation to beneficiaries with no substance use disorder. After program implementation, the likelihood of having an emergency department visit in a quarter declined by 9.4 percentage points (a 21.1 percent relative decrease) among beneficiaries with opioid use disorder, compared to 0.9 percentage points among beneficiaries with no substance use disorder. Similarly, the likelihood of having an inpatient hospitalization declined among beneficiaries with opioid use disorder. In contrast to other states, Virginia has a new Medicaid expansion population whose beneficiaries enter a delivery system in which reforms of the addiction treatment system are well under way.",
        "Using North Carolina Medicaid 2016-18 claims data, we found that approximately one in ten adolescents (10.8 percent) filled at least one opioid prescription per year. Dentists, advanced practice providers, and surgeons were common prescribers of opioids to children. In addition, half of children who experienced opioid-related adverse events had filled opioid prescriptions in the prior six months.",
        "The burden of rising health care costs is being shifted to consumers, and 30 percent of health care costs are attributed to wasteful spending on low- or no-value services. Value-based insurance design (VBID) is intended to encourage the use of high-value services or discourage the use of low-value services by aligning cost with quality. During the summer and fall of 2016, this mixed-methods study used focus groups and a quantitative analysis of survey data to explore consumer decision making in Northern California. When presented with three common VBID approaches, the focus groups favored value-based benefit design the most (41 percent), followed by reference pricing (28 percent) and narrow networks (21 percent). When presented with VBID scenarios, participants were skeptical of the value-based trade-offs and reported seeking information they wanted instead of relying on information that health plans provide. Engaging consumers to successfully reduce waste through VBID will require clarifying trade-offs to support consumers\u2019 processes for arriving at high-value decisions as well as reaching out to consumers through trusted sources and networks.",
        "The elderly account for the majority of medical spending in many countries, raising concerns about potentially unnecessary spending, especially during the final months of life. Using a well-defined starting point (hospitalization for an initial acute myocardial infarction) with evidence-based postevent treatments, we examined age trends in treatments in the US and Norway, two countries with high levels of per capita medical spending. After accounting for comorbidities, we found marked decreases within both countries in the use of invasive treatments with age (for example, less use of percutaneous coronary interventions and surgery) and the use of relatively inexpensive medications (for example, less use of anticholesterol [statin] drugs for which generic versions are widely available). The treatment decreases with age were larger in Norway compared with those in the US. The less frequent treatment of the oldest of the old, without even use of basic medications, suggests potential age-related bias and a disconnect with the evidence on treatment value. Hospital organization and payment in both countries should incentivize greater equity in treatment use across ages.",
        "Every human being has twenty-three chromosomes and thousands of genes. Precision medicine aims to assess risk and customize treatment for specific genetic variants and disease characteristics associated with these human building blocks. Large databases of genetic information are needed to locate the best targets for specific therapies. This month's DataGraphic focuses on precision medicine's rapid growth in the past two decades in genetic tests and therapies and its successes in prolonging life and cutting some costs. It also highlights challenges ahead due to the high cost of therapies, the limited representation of racial and ethnic minorities in genetic databases, and uncertainty among professionals about how to apply genetic findings.",
        "Jails and prisons are major sites of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Many jurisdictions in the United States have therefore accelerated the release of low-risk offenders. Early release, however, does not address how arrest and pretrial detention practices may be contributing to disease spread. Using data from Cook County Jail-one of the largest known nodes of SARS-CoV-2 spread in the United States-in Chicago, Illinois, we analyzed the relationship between jailing practices and community infections at the ZIP code level. We found that jail-community cycling was a significant predictor of cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), accounting for 55 percent of the variance in case rates across ZIP codes in Chicago and 37 percent of the variance in all of Illinois. Jail-community cycling far exceeds race, poverty, public transit use, and population density as a predictor of variance. The data suggest that cycling people through Cook County Jail alone is associated with 15.7 percent of all documented COVID-19 cases in Illinois and 15.9 percent of all documented cases in Chicago as of April 19, 2020. Our findings support arguments for reduced reliance on incarceration and for related justice reforms both as emergency measures during the present pandemic and as sustained structural changes vital for future pandemic preparedness and public health.",
        "More than thirty years since the enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), people with disability continue to experience health care disparities. The ADA mandates that patients with disability receive reasonable accommodations. In our survey of 714 US physicians in outpatient practices, 35.8 percent reported knowing little or nothing about their legal responsibilities under the ADA, 71.2 percent answered incorrectly about who determines reasonable accommodations, 20.5 percent did not correctly identify who pays for these accommodations, and 68.4 felt that they were at risk for ADA lawsuits. Physicians who felt that lack of formal education or training was a moderate or large barrier to caring for patients with disability were more likely to report little or no knowledge of their responsibilities under the law and were more likely to believe that they were at risk for an ADA lawsuit. To achieve equitable care and social justice for patients with disability, considerable improvements are needed to educate physicians and make health care delivery systems more accessible and accommodating.",
        "In a national survey, seriously ill Medicare beneficiaries described financial hardships resulting from their illness\u2014despite high beneficiary satisfaction with Medicare overall and the fact that many have supplemental insurance. About half reported a serious problem paying medical bills, with prescription drugs proving most onerous.",
        "Driven by evidence of continuing gaps in health care quality and efficiency and inspired by the emergence of new value-based payment models, both large and small health care organizations are developing and deploying a wide range of care delivery innovations. But how can decision makers in these organizations determine if the innovations really improve service delivery, patient experience, clinical outcomes, or costs? Organization leaders need appropriate, timely evidence to inform their decision making. In this article we describe a range of approaches to evaluating innovations and pose key questions about the validity of the results. We highlight a specific type of evaluation approach\u2014the stepped wedge design\u2014because it can balance the need for internal and external validity with the ability to generate timely results. We elaborate on three key steps in the innovation assessment phase (identifying the target population, describing baseline performance, and documenting the components of the innovation) that are useful for both organizations that will generate new evidence and those using evidence generated by others. We conclude with a discussion of payer approaches for supporting health care organizations in their efforts to develop new evidence on innovations.",
        "Climate change has altered global to local weather patterns and increased sea levels, and it will continue to do so. Average temperatures, precipitation amounts, and other variables such as humidity levels are all rising. In addition, weather variability is increasing, causing, for example, a greater number of heat waves, many of which are more intense and last longer, and more floods and droughts. These changes are collectively increasing the number of injuries, illnesses, and deaths from a wide range of climate-sensitive health outcomes. Future health risks will be determined not just by the hazards created by a changing climate but also by the sensitivity of individuals and communities exposed to these hazards and the capacity of health systems to prepare for and effectively manage the attendant risks. These risks include deaths and injuries from extreme events (for example, heat waves, storms, and floods), infectious diseases (including food-, water-, and vectorborne illnesses), and food and water insecurity. These risks are unevenly distributed and both create new inequities and exacerbate those that already exist. Most of these risks are projected to increase with each additional unit of warming. Using an equity lens to move beyond incremental to transformational resilience would reduce vulnerability and improve sustainability for all, but substantial additional funding is required for proactive and effective actions by the health system.",
        "Understanding regional variation in the effect of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on health insurance coverage among vulnerable populations such as American Indian and Alaska Native adults has important policy implications. We used American Community Survey data for the period 2010\u201317 to examine unadjusted trends in health insurance coverage among American Indians and Alaska Natives across ten US regions. In each region we also used multivariate regression to evaluate the effects of the ACA on insurance coverage among American Indians and Alaska Natives and differences in effects between that group and non-Hispanic whites. In the West we observed significant improvements in public insurance among American Indians and Alaska Natives, and disparities compared to non-Hispanic whites were reduced following the ACA. Although there were unadjusted increases in insurance coverage across most regions, regression analyses suggested that there were no significant post-ACA changes in public or private health insurance coverage among American Indians and Alaska Natives in the Oklahoma, Bemidji, or Alaska regions. In sum, health insurance among American Indians and Alaska Natives increased after the ACA, but improvements were not consistent across regions. More attention is needed to improve insurance coverage among American Indians and Alaska Natives in midwestern regions.",
        "Although generic drugs are typically inexpensive, rising prices among some generic drugs in recent years have raised concern. Using Medicaid data, we found that one in five generic drugs sold in the US experienced a price spike (defined as a doubling in price over the course of one year) initiated by at least one manufacturer during the period 2014-17. There was a trend toward fewer price spikes each year, from 7.8 percent of drugs in 2014 to 5.8 percent in 2017. Among drugs experiencing price spikes, 51 percent were injected products, 64 percent had three or fewer manufacturers, and 18 percent were in shortage at the time of the spike. Generic drug price spikes cost Medicaid $1.5 billion during 2014-16, representing 4.2 percent of all Medicaid generic drug spending in that period. The trend toward fewer price spikes over time may be due to increased public scrutiny and regulatory actions. However, price spikes can be very costly, and additional policies are needed to both ensure adequate competition and control prices among generic drugs.",
        "Using data from the American Medical Association's 2016 Physician Practice Benchmark Survey, we provide the first nationally representative estimates of physicians' use of telemedicine. In 2016, 15.4 percent of physicians worked in practices that used telemedicine for a wide spectrum of patient interactions, including e-visits as well as diagnoses made by radiologists who used telemedicine to store and forward data. In the same year, 11.2 percent of physicians worked in practices that used telemedicine for interactions between physicians and health care professionals. We found that in addition to specialty, larger practice size was an important correlate of telemedicine use. This suggests that despite regulatory and legislative changes to encourage the use of telemedicine, the financial burden of implementing it may be a continuing barrier for small practices.",
        "Massachusetts has one of the highest cumulative incidence rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in the US. Understanding which specific demographic, economic, and occupational factors have contributed to disparities in COVID-19 incidence rates across the state is critical to informing public health strategies. We performed a cross-sectional study of 351 Massachusetts cities and towns from January 1 to May 6, 2020, and found that a 10-percentage-point increase in the Black non-Latino population was associated with an increase of 312.3 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population, whereas a 10-percentage-point increase in the Latino population was associated with an increase of 258.2 cases per 100,000. Independent predictors of higher COVID-19 rates included the proportion of foreign-born noncitizens living in a community, mean household size, and share of food service workers. After adjustment for these variables, the association between the Latino population and COVID-19 rates was attenuated. In contrast, the association between the Black population and COVID-19 rates persisted but may be explained by other systemic inequities. Public health and policy efforts that improve care for foreign-born noncitizens, address crowded housing, and protect food service workers may help mitigate the spread of COVID-19 among minority communities.",
        "Older Americans living in the community who need help with functional limitations overwhelmingly rely on unpaid care, which is often provided by working-age family members. This study assessed the impact of unpaid family caregiving on the likelihood of working and hours worked for caregivers and calculated the related cost of forgone earnings in 2013 and 2050. The current economic cost is about $67 billion, which by midcentury will likely double to $132\u2013$147 billion, fueled primarily by the growth of the disabled older population and the increased share of better-educated caregivers. Average opportunity cost per caregiver will likely increase by 8\u201320 percent and per US resident by 54\u201372 percent. Future policy action could benefit from accounting fully for the economic costs in addition to the benefits of unpaid caregiving, which would help better define the scope and size of programs needed to support caregivers.",
        "Neighborhoods influence children's health, so it is important to have measures of children's neighborhood environments. Using the Child Opportunity Index 2.0, a composite metric of the neighborhood conditions that children experience today across the US, we present new evidence of vast geographic and racial/ethnic inequities in neighborhood conditions in the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the US. Child Opportunity Scores range from 20 in Fresno, California, to 83 in Madison, Wisconsin. However, more than 90 percent of the variation in neighborhood opportunity happens within metropolitan areas. In 35 percent of these areas the Child Opportunity Gap (the difference between Child Opportunity Scores in very low- and very high-opportunity neighborhoods) is higher than across the entire national neighborhood distribution. Nationally, the Child Opportunity Score for White children (73) is much higher than for Black (24) and Hispanic (33) children. To improve children's health and well-being, the health sector must move beyond a focus on treating disease or modifying individual behavior to a broader focus on neighborhood conditions. This will require the health sector to both implement place-based interventions and collaborate with other sectors such as housing to execute mobility-based interventions.",
        "Work and health are inextricably linked. Most American adults spend nearly half of their waking hours at work. Poor physical and social working conditions are associated with chronic illnesses such as hypertension, and work-related accidents and illnesses claim billions of dollars in health care costs and lost productivity annually. Racial and ethnic minorities disproportionately work in low-paying jobs and face increased risks of work-related injury or disability. Policies and benefits such as paid sick leave and unemployment compensation are associated with improved health outcomes. Employment is also the source for most nonelderly Americans' health insurance coverage. Some companies promote healthy lifestyle choices through wellness and other programs, understanding that healthy, productive workers contribute positively to the bottom line.",
        "Analyzing national survey data, we found that workers in traditionally blue-collar industries (service jobs, farming, construction, and transportation) experienced the largest gains in health insurance after implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2014. Compared to other occupations, these had lower employer-based coverage rates before the ACA. Most of the post-ACA coverage gains came from Medicaid and directly purchased nongroup insurance.",
        "Demographic and epidemiological changes are shifting the disease burden from communicable to noncommunicable diseases in lower-income countries. Within a generation, the share of disease burden attributed to noncommunicable diseases in some poor countries will exceed 80 percent, rivaling that of rich countries, but this burden is likely to affect much younger people in poorer countries. The health systems of lower-income countries are unprepared for this change. We examined the shift to noncommunicable diseases and estimated preparedness for the shift by ranking 172 nations using a health system capacity index for noncommunicable disease. We project that the countries with the greatest increases in the share of disease burden attributable to noncommunicable disease over the next twenty-five years will also be the least prepared for the change, as they ranked low on our capacity index and are expected to have the smallest increases in national health spending. National governments and donors must invest more in preparing the health systems of lower-income countries for the dramatic shift to noncommunicable diseases and in reducing modifiable noncommunicable disease risks.",
        "There is a formidable historical arc to health care policy: Every modern US president has sought to expand coverage. Democrats eagerly placed the issue on the agenda. Republicans vociferously opposed Democratic proposals but countered with creative ways to expand coverage on their own terms. Democrats eventually absorbed elements of the latest Republican plan\u2014which Republicans, in turn, attacked, and the cycle began anew. The dynamic interaction between the parties slowly, often haphazardly, expanded health insurance as each sought to extend coverage in its own way. We speculate about whether the recent Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act constitute a sharp break with the past, perhaps because opposition to government, exacerbated by racial anxieties, has changed the Republican calculus. Alternatively, there are still some reasons to conclude that the arc of health policy continues to bend toward increasing coverage.",
        "Comprehensive mandates for prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) require state-licensed prescribers and dispensers both to register with and to use the programs in most clinical circumstances. Such mandates have the potential to improve providers' participation and reduce opioid-related adverse events. Using Medicaid prescription data and hospital utilization data across the US in the period 2011\u201316, we found that state implementation of comprehensive PDMP mandates was associated with a reduction in the opioid prescription rate from 161.47 to 147.07 per 1,000 enrollees per quarter, a reduction in the opioid-related inpatient stay rate from 97.50 to 93.34 per 100,000 enrollees per quarter, and a reduction in the opioid-related emergency department (ED) visit rate from 74.60 to 61.36 per 100,000 enrollees per quarter. Our estimated annual reductions of approximately 12,000 inpatient stays and 39,000 ED visits could save over $155 million in Medicaid spending, a fact that deserves policy attention when states attempt to strengthen and refine PDMPs to better tackle the opioid crisis.",
        "The prevalence of accountable care organizations (ACOs) has grown significantly across Medicare and commercial payers in the past decade, but there are limited insights regarding the effect of ACOs on costs in the commercial population. We used longitudinal administrative claims data over the course of nineteen calendar quarters from 2016 to 2021 to assess the ongoing incremental impact of Elevance Health's commercial ACO program on cost and use across fifteen US states. We also analyzed the program's impact on spending subcategories (inpatient, outpatient, professional, and pharmacy) and measured differences in quality performance. The program was associated with incremental savings during this period. Incremental savings were greater in the fully insured population relative to the administrative services only population and were due to outpatient and pharmacy savings. ACO providers had superior quality performance measures relative to contracted providers not participating in ACOs. Payers should be aware of the potential for diminishing marginal returns of ACO contracting on containing health care costs.",
        "Children's participation in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) rose by 5 percentage points between 2013 and 2016. As a result, 1.7 million fewer Medicaid/CHIP-eligible children were uninsured in 2016. Participation was lower among adults than among children, and nearly 6 million Medicaid-eligible adults were uninsured in 2016.",
        "The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is the largest poverty alleviation program for families with children in the US, and it has well-documented health effects. However, not all eligible families receive benefits. The Assessing California Communities' Experiences with Safety Net Supports (ACCESS) Study interviewed 411 EITC-eligible Californians with young children to understand low take-up of the federal EITC and California's supplemental CalEITC. Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish in 2020 and 2021 to gather information on sociodemographic characteristics, tax filing, and EITC receipt (verified via tax forms). Among those eligible for the EITC or CalEITC, 9 percent of participants did not file taxes; among those who did file taxes, about 84 percent received the EITC, and 83 percent received the CalEITC. Lower likelihood of federal EITC receipt among those eligible and filing taxes was associated with being younger, not speaking English, and not having prior knowledge of the EITC. Lower likelihood of CalEITC receipt among those eligible and filing taxes was associated with not speaking English. These findings can inform policies and community interventions to increase EITC take-up and thereby help address health equity.",
        "For two decades, various initiatives have encouraged Americans to consider quality when choosing clinicians, both to enhance informed choice and to reduce disparities in access to high-quality providers. The literature portrays these efforts as largely ineffective. But this depiction overlooks two factors: the dramatic expansion since 2010 in the availability of patients' narratives about care and the growth of information seeking among consumers. Using surveys fielded in 2010, 2014, and 2015, we assessed the impact of these changes on consumers' awareness of quality information and sociodemographic differences. Public exposure to any quality information doubled between 2010 and 2015, while exposure to patient narratives and experience surveys tripled. Reflecting a greater propensity to seek quality metrics, minority consumers remained better informed than whites over time, albeit with differences across subgroups in the types of information encountered. An education-related gradient in quality awareness also emerged over the past decade. Public policy should respond to emerging trends in information exposure, establish standards for rigorous elicitation of narratives, and assist consumers' learning from a combination of narratives and quantified metrics on clinician quality.",
        "US health care spending increased 4.6 percent to reach $3.6 trillion in 2018, a faster growth rate than the rate of 4.2 percent in 2017 but the same rate as in 2016. The share of the economy devoted to health care spending declined to 17.7 percent in 2018, compared to 17.9 percent in 2017. The 0.4-percentage-point acceleration in overall growth in 2018 was driven by faster growth in both private health insurance and Medicare, which were influenced by the reinstatement of the health insurance tax. For personal health care spending (which accounted for 84 percent of national health care spending), growth in 2018 remained unchanged from 2017 at 4.1 percent. The total number of uninsured people increased by 1.0 million for the second year in a row, to reach 30.7 million in 2018.",
        "Telehealth services that allow remote communication between the patient and the clinical team are an emerging part of care delivery. Given language barriers, patients with limited English proficiency present a unique set of challenges in integrating telehealth and ensuring equity. Using data from 84,419 respondents in the 2015\u201318 California Health Interview Survey, we assessed the association between limited English proficiency and telehealth use (telephone and video visits) and evaluated the impact of telehealth use on health care access and use. We found that patients with limited English proficiency had lower rates of telehealth use (4.8 percent versus 12.3 percent) compared with proficient English speakers. In weighted multivariable logistic regression, patients with limited English proficiency still had about half the odds of using telehealth. Telehealth use was associated with increased emergency department use for all patients. This study suggests that policy makers and clinicians must focus on limited English proficiency as an important dimension to promote telehealth equity and decrease digital divides.",
        "Aspects of the research and practice paradigm known as the diffusion of innovations are applicable to the complex context of health care, for both explanatory and interventionist purposes. This article answers the question, \u201cWhat is diffusion?\u201d by identifying the parameters of diffusion processes: what they are, how they operate, and why worthy innovations in health care do not spread more rapidly. We clarify how the diffusion of innovations is related to processes of dissemination and implementation, sustainability, improvement activity, and scale-up, and we suggest the diffusion principles that can be readily used in the design of interventions.",
        "More than sixty-one million Americans have disabilities, and increasing evidence documents that they experience health care disparities. Although many factors likely contribute to these disparities, one little-studied but potential cause involves physicians\u2019 perceptions of people with disability. In our survey of 714 practicing US physicians nationwide, 82.4 percent reported that people with significant disability have worse quality of life than nondisabled people. Only 40.7 percent of physicians were very confident about their ability to provide the same quality of care to patients with disability, just 56.5 percent strongly agreed that they welcomed patients with disability into their practices, and 18.1 percent strongly agreed that the health care system often treats these patients unfairly. More than thirty years after the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 was enacted, these findings about physicians\u2019 perceptions of this population raise questions about ensuring equitable care to people with disability. Potentially biased views among physicians could contribute to persistent health care disparities affecting people with disability.",
        "Only a small proportion of people with a substance use disorder (SUD) receive treatment. The shortage of SUD treatment providers, particularly in rural areas, is an important driver of this treatment gap. Telemedicine could be a means of expanding access to treatment. However, several key regulatory and reimbursement barriers to greater use of telemedicine for SUD (tele-SUD) exist, and both Congress and the states are considering or have recently passed legislation to address them. To inform these efforts, we describe how tele-SUD is being used. Using claims data for 2010\u201317 from a large commercial insurer, we identified characteristics of tele-SUD users and examined how tele-SUD is being used in conjunction with in-person SUD care. Despite a rapid increase in tele-SUD over the study period, we found low use rates overall, particularly relative to the growth in telemental health. Tele-SUD is primarily used to complement in-person care and is disproportionately used by those with relatively severe SUD. Given the severity of the opioid epidemic, low rates of tele-SUD use represent a missed opportunity. As tele-SUD becomes more available, it will be important to monitor closely which tele-SUD delivery models are being used and their impact on access and outcomes.",
        "Pediatric populations are uniquely vulnerable to the usability and safety challenges of electronic health records (EHRs), particularly those related to medication, yet little is known about the specific issues contributing to hazards. To understand specific usability issues and medication errors in the care of children, we analyzed 9,000 patient safety reports, made in the period 2012-17, from three different health care institutions that were likely related to EHR use. Of the 9,000 reports, 3,243 (36 percent) had a usability issue that contributed to the medication event, and 609 (18.8 percent) of the 3,243 might have resulted in patient harm. The general pattern of usability challenges and medication errors were the same across the three sites. The most common usability challenges were associated with system feedback and the visual display. The most common medication error was improper dosing.",
        "Antiracist health policy research requires methodological innovation that creates equity-centered and antiracist solutions to health inequities by centering the complexities and insidiousness of structural racism. The development of effective health policy and health equity interventions requires sound empirical characterization of the nature of structural racism and its impact on public health. However, there is a disconnect between the conceptualization and measurement of structural racism in the public health literature. Given that structural racism is a system of interconnected institutions that operates with a set of racialized rules that maintain White supremacy, how can anyone accurately measure its insidiousness? This article highlights methodological approaches that will move the field forward in its ability to validly measure structural racism for the purposes of achieving health equity. We identify three key areas that require scholarly attention to advance antiracist health policy research: historical context, geographical context, and theory-based novel quantitative and qualitative methods that capture the multifaceted and systemic properties of structural racism as well as other systems of oppression.",
        "Enrollment in the Marketplaces of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has fallen short of original expectations, because the ACA\u2019s regulatory changes made coverage costlier for many Americans with incomes above 150 percent of the federal poverty level. There are ways to strengthen and expand the role of the individual market in providing affordable, personalized options to all nonelderly Americans. These include insured people in costly group plans, uninsured people in good health but without affordable options, those with preexisting conditions, and those who live in states that did not expand eligibility for Medicaid. A more robust individual market could expand coverage so that it would be more sustainable than the status quo. Much as the authors of the Affordable Care Act drew on Massachusetts reforms signed into law by Gov. Mitt Romney (R), market-oriented health reformers should learn from the ACA and Medicare\u2019s private insurance programs in order to build a personalized, consumer-driven path toward universal coverage.",
        "The Affordable Care Act mandated data collection standards to identify people with disabilities in federal surveys to better understand and address health disparities within this population. Most federal surveys use six questions from the American Community Survey (ACS-6) to identify people with disabilities, whereas many international surveys use the six-item Washington Group Short Set (WG-SS). The National Survey on Health and Disability (NSHD), which focuses on working-age adults ages 18\u201364, uses both question sets and contains other disability questions. We compared ACS-6 and WG-SS responses with self-reported disability types. The ACS-6 and WG-SS failed to identify 20 percent and 43 percent, respectively, of respondents who reported disabilities in response to other NSHD questions (a broader WG-SS version missed 4.4 percent of respondents). The ACS-6 and the WG-SS performed especially poorly in capturing respondents with psychiatric disabilities or chronic health conditions. Researchers and policy makers must augment or strengthen federal disability questions to improve the accuracy of disability prevalence counts, understanding of health disparities, and planning of appropriate services for a diverse and growing population.",
        "Despite growing antibiotic resistance, the clinical drug development pipeline for antibiotics has been sparse largely because of an unsustainable business model. We illustrate three models to accelerate antibiotic development, using Medicare new technology add-on payments as a market support mechanism. The first two models subsidize drug development for Medicare beneficiaries, and the third model applies a payment for every patient with a resistant infection to essentially create a funding pool. We found that the reimbursement required to sustain research and development would range from $637 to $121,365, depending on the payment model and the incidence of the resistant infection in question. With a $300 million public research subsidy, the payment for an antibiotic would drop to between $273 and $10,396 per course. Our market support model could increase the likelihood of attracting private investment for antibiotic development.",
        "About one in four employees in a cohort of 408,000 US workers took a temporary leave of absence from work because of illness or injury in the period 2008\u201312. They accounted for nearly 60 percent (about $6.5 billion) of total worker health care and disability payments. This finding underscores the importance of workplace care management, lifestyle management, and health and safety efforts to prevent disability leaves.",
        "Despite concerns about physicians\u2019 workload associated with electronic health records (EHRs), little attention has been paid to the relationship between physicians\u2019 well-being and the in-basket messages physicians receive\u2014specifically, their volume and sources. Analyses of EHR work performed by physicians in a multispecialty practice found that in-basket messages generated by the EHR system accounted for almost half (114) of the 243 weekly in-basket messages received per physician, on average\u2014far exceeding the numbers received from their colleagues (53) and patients (30). In a survey, 36 percent of the physicians reported burnout symptoms, and 29 percent intended to reduce their clinical work time in the upcoming year. Receiving more than the average number of system-generated in-basket messages was associated with 40 percent higher probability of burnout and 38 percent higher probability of intending to reduce clinical work time. Physicians\u2019 perceptions of a positive work environment were associated with lower odds of burnout and intention to reduce clinical work time and with greater satisfaction with life. Female physicians had a higher risk of burnout and lower satisfaction with life, compared to males. Meaningful redesign of EHR in-basket workflow and a wellness-enhancing work environment are necessary to effectively improve physicians\u2019 well-being.",
        "Recent studies have examined strategic behaviors in the pharmaceutical industry that extend patent and regulatory protection, known alternatively as \"lifecycle management\" or \"evergreening.\" This literature highlights the extent to which the patent system is increasingly focused on granting new protections for minor modifications of existing innovations. The phenomenon raises questions regarding the value of the trend to society and its potential effects on innovation. Specifically, is there value in tinkering with existing medication, and does that value justify the extensive rewards available with a \"golden\" patent? Could aspects of the current system be distorting how companies choose to spend their precious innovation time and money? As a society, we may decide that certain parts of the system are valuable and that others require reform, but we cannot make any considered evaluation without understanding how the system works on the ground.",
        "Expansion of the Medicare Advantage program during 2009\u201318 saw greater enrollment among racial/ethnic minorities and other traditionally marginalized groups. Growth was more rapid among Black, Hispanic, and dually enrolled beneficiaries than among White and nondual beneficiaries. The implications of greater heterogeneity in the program for enrollee outcomes are uncertain.",
        "Each year approximately 700 people die in the United States from pregnancy-related complications. We describe the characteristics of pregnancy-related deaths due to mental health conditions, including substance use disorders, and identify opportunities for prevention based on recommendations from fourteen state Maternal Mortality Review Committees (MMRCs) from the period 2008\u201317. Among 421 pregnancy-related deaths with an MMRC-determined underlying cause of death, 11 percent were due to mental health conditions. Pregnancy-related mental health deaths were more likely than deaths from other causes to be determined by an MMRC to be preventable (100 percent versus 64 percent), to occur among non-Hispanic White people (86 percent versus 45 percent), and to occur 43\u2013365 days postpartum (63 percent versus 18 percent). Sixty-three percent of pregnancy-related mental health deaths were by suicide. Nearly three-quarters of people with a pregnancy-related mental health cause of death had a history of depression, and more than two-thirds had past or current substance use. MMRC recommendations can be used to prioritize interventions and can inform strategies to enable screening, care coordination, and continuation of care throughout pregnancy and the year postpartum.",
        "Nursing staff turnover has long been considered an important indicator of nursing home quality. However, turnover has never been reported on the Nursing Home Compare website, likely because of the lack of adequate data. On July 1, 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services began collecting auditable payroll-based daily staffing data for US nursing homes. We used 492 million nurse shifts from these data to calculate a novel turnover metric representing the percentage of hours of nursing staff care that turned over annually at each of 15,645 facilities. Mean and median annual turnover rates for total nursing staff were roughly 128 percent and 94 percent, respectively. Turnover rates were correlated with facility location, for-profit status, chain ownership, Medicaid patient census, and star ratings. Disseminating facilities\u2019 nursing staff turnover rates on Nursing Home Compare could provide important quality information for policy makers, payers, and consumers, and it may incentivize efforts to reduce turnover.",
        "The exclusion of people with disabilities from clinical research without appropriate justification is discriminatory, is counter to federal regulations and research guidelines, and limits study generalizability. This matter is understudied, and data on the disability status of trial participants are rarely collected or reported. We analyzed ninety-seven recent interventional protocols in four therapeutic areas registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. Eighty-five percent of protocols allowed broad investigator discretion to determine eligibility, whereas only 18 percent explicitly permitted people with disabilities to use forms of support (such as supported decision making or assistive devices) to facilitate study participation. Eligibility criteria affecting people with disabilities included exclusions for psychiatric (68 percent), substance use (62 percent), HIV or hepatitis (53 percent), cognitive or intellectual (42 percent), visual (34 percent), hearing (10 percent), mobility (9 percent), long-term care (6 percent), and speech and communication (3 percent) disability-related domains. Documented justification was provided for only 24 percent of these exclusions. We recommend greater scrutiny of study eligibility criteria, scientific or ethical justification of exclusions, and accessible study design.",
        "The rapid growth of the US population ages seventy-five and older in the coming years will increase the need for housing that accommodates mobility limitations and helps connect residents with supportive services and opportunities for socialization. While expanding the supply of housing with services such as those provided by independent and assisted living facilities is needed, so too are greater supports to allow older adults with disabilities to age successfully in their homes and communities. These include financial support for modifications to the home, the delivery of supportive services in the home by both family and paid caregivers, and the expansion of housing options in communities where older adults live.",
        "Total nominal US health care spending increased 3.9 percent to $3.5 trillion in 2017, slowing from growth of 4.8 percent in 2016. The rate of growth in 2017 was similar to the increases between 2008 and 2013, which preceded the faster growth experienced during 2014-15-a period that was marked by insurance coverage expansion and large increases in prescription drug spending. Slower growth in health care spending in 2017 was mainly attributable to the use and intensity of goods and services, particularly for hospital care, physician and clinical services, and retail prescription drugs. Nearly all major sources of insurance and sponsors of health care experienced slower growth in 2017. On a per capita basis, spending on health care increased 3.2 percent and reached $10,739 in 2017. The share of gross domestic product devoted to health care spending was 17.9 percent in 2017, similar to the share in 2016.",
        "In the Furthering Access to Stroke Telemedicine (FAST) Act, passed as part of a budget omnibus in 2018, Congress permanently expanded Medicare payment for telemedicine consultations for acute stroke (\"telestroke\") from delivery only in rural areas to delivery in both urban and rural areas, effective January 1, 2019. Using a controlled time-series analysis, we found that one year after FAST Act implementation, billing for Medicare telestroke increased substantially in emergency departments at both directly affected urban hospitals and indirectly affected rural hospitals. However, at that time only a minority of hospitals with known telestroke capacity had ever billed Medicare for that service, and there was substantial billing inconsistent with Medicare requirements. As Congress considers options for Medicare telemedicine payment after the COVID-19 pandemic, our findings, which are consistent with confusion among providers regarding telemedicine billing requirements, suggest that simplified payment rules would help ensure that expanded reimbursement achieves its intended impact.",
        "The accessibility of pharmacies may be an overlooked contributor to persistent racial and ethnic disparities in the use of prescription medications and essential health care services within urban areas in the US. We examined the availability and geographic accessibility of pharmacies across neighborhoods based on their racial/ethnic composition in the thirty most populous US cities. In all cities examined, we found persistently fewer pharmacies located in Black and Hispanic/Latino neighborhoods than White or diverse neighborhoods throughout 2007\u201315. In 2015 there were disproportionately more pharmacy deserts in Black or Hispanic/Latino neighborhoods than in White or diverse neighborhoods, including those that are not federally designated Medically Underserved Areas. These disparities were most pronounced in Chicago, Illinois; Los Angeles, California; Baltimore, Maryland; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Dallas, Texas; Boston, Massachusetts; and Albuquerque, New Mexico. We also found that Black and Hispanic/Latino neighborhoods were more likely to experience pharmacy closures compared with other neighborhoods. Our findings suggest that efforts to increase access to medications and essential health care services, including in response to COVID-19, should consider policies that ensure equitable pharmacy accessibility across neighborhoods in US cities. Such efforts could include policies that encourage pharmacies to locate in pharmacy deserts, including increases to Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement rates for pharmacies most at risk for closure.",
        "In 2020 Medicare reintroduced Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) Hierarchical Condition Categories (HCCs) to risk-adjust Medicare Advantage and accountable care organization (ACO) payments. The potential for Medicare spending increases from this policy change are not well understood because the baseline accuracy of ADRD HCCs is uncertain. Using linked 2016\u201318 claims and electronic health record data from a large ACO, we evaluated the accuracy of claims-based ADRD HCCs against a reference standard of clinician-adjudicated disease. An estimated 7.5 percent of beneficiaries had clinician-adjudicated ADRD. Among those with ADRD HCCs, 34 percent did not have clinician-adjudicated disease. The false-negative and false-positive rates were 22.7 percent and 3.2 percent, respectively. Medicare spending for those with false-negative ADRD HCCs exceeded that of true positives by $14,619 per beneficiary. If, after the reintroduction of risk adjustment for ADRD, all false negatives were coded as having ADRD, expenditure benchmarks for beneficiaries with ADRD would increase by 9 percent. Monitoring ADRD coding could become challenging in the setting of concurrent incentives to decrease false-negative rates and increase false-positive rates.",
        "Under current law, national health spending is projected to grow 5.5 percent annually on average in 2017\u201326 and to represent 19.7 percent of the economy in 2026. Projected national health spending and enrollment growth over the next decade is largely driven by fundamental economic and demographic factors: changes in projected income growth, increases in prices for medical goods and services, and enrollment shifts from private health insurance to Medicare that are related to the aging of the population. The recent enactment of tax legislation that eliminated the individual mandate is expected to result in only a small reduction to insurance coverage trends.",
        "Safety-net programs improve health for low-income children over the short and long term. In September 2018 the Trump administration announced its intention to change the guidance on how to identify a potential \"public charge,\" defined as a noncitizen primarily dependent on the government for subsistence. After this change, immigrants' applications for permanent residence could be denied for using a broader range of safety-net programs. We investigated whether the announced public charge rule affected the share of children enrolled in Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, using county-level data. Results show that a 1-percentage-point increase in a county's noncitizen share was associated with a 0.1-percentage-point reduction in child Medicaid use. Applied nationwide, this implies a decline in coverage of 260,000 children. The public charge rule was adopted in February 2020, just before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic began in the US. These results suggest that the Trump administration's public charge announcement could have led to many thousands of eligible, low-income children failing to receive safety-net support during a severe health and economic crisis."
