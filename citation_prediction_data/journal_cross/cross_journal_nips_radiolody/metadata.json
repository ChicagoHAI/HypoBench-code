The dataset contains papers from a list of academic journals or conferences, and the goal is to predict whether a paper will be in the top or bottom percentile of citations after a specified number of years. The dataset includes the title, abstract, and publication year of each paper, along with a label indicating whether the paper is in the top or bottom percentile of citations after a specified number of years.
