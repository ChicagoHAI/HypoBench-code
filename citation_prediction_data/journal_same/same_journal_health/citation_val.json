To explore why proposals to remediate this problem have not gained traction, the authors interviewed experts involved in efforts to improve the oral health status of low-income and minority children during the past decade. Key informants believe that success requires addressing both consumer demand and provider supply factors. They especially cite the lack of public outcry for more accessible oral health care and the undervaluing of oral health, relative to medical care. Informants were cautiously optimistic that strategies such as health literacy and outreach campaigns, which have helped increase children's physical activity and improve their diets, offer unexplored opportunities for progress.", "National and local policies to improve diet in low-income US populations include increasing physical access to grocery stores and supermarkets in underserved neighborhoods. In a pilot study that evaluated the impacts of opening a new supermarket in a Philadelphia community considered a \u201cfood desert\u201d\u2014part of the Pennsylvania Fresh Food Financing Initiative\u2014we found that the intervention moderately improved residents\u2019 perceptions of food accessibility. However, it did not lead to changes in reported fruit and vegetable intake or body mass index. The effectiveness of interventions to improve physical access to food and reduce obesity by encouraging supermarkets to locate in underserved areas therefore remains unclear. Nevertheless, the present findings suggest that simply improving a community\u2019s retail food infrastructure may not produce desired changes in food purchasing and consumption patterns. Complementary policy changes and interventions may be needed to help consumers bridge the gap between perception and action. The replication of our findings in other settings and research into the factors that influence community residents\u2019 receptivity to improved food access are urgently required.", "Understanding the links between housing and health is increasingly important. Poor housing quality is a predictor of poor health and developmental problems in low-income children. We examined associations between public housing type and recurrent pediatric emergency and urgent care hospital visits. Children ages 0\u201318 with public insurance who sought emergency care from any of three large medical systems in San Francisco were categorized by whether they lived in public housing redeveloped through the federal HOPE VI program, nonredeveloped public housing, or nonpublic housing in a census tract that also contained public housing. After we adjusted for potential confounding characteristics, we found that children living in nonredeveloped public housing were 39 percent more likely to have one or more repeat visits within one year for acute health care services unrelated to the initial visit, compared to children who lived in redeveloped HOPE VI housing. We observed no differences in repeat visits between children in redeveloped HOPE VI housing and those in nonpublic housing. These findings support the continued redevelopment of public housing as a means of both improving the health of vulnerable high-risk children from low-income neighborhoods and reducing health care costs.", "Given the substantial federal financial incentives soon to be available to providers who make \"meaningful use\" of electronic health records, tracking the progress of this health care technology conversion is a policy priority. Using a recent survey of U.S. hospitals, we found that the share of hospitals that had adopted either basic or comprehensive electronic records has risen modestly, from 8.7 percent in 2008 to 11.9 percent in 2009. Small, public, and rural hospitals were less likely to embrace electronic records than their larger, private, and urban counterparts. Only 2 percent of U.S. hospitals reported having electronic health records that would allow them to meet the federal government's \"meaningful use\" criteria. These findings underscore the fact that the transition to a digital health care system is likely to be a long one.", "Estimates of annual health spending for a comprehensive set of medical conditions are presented for the entire US population and with totals benchmarked to the National Health Expenditure Accounts. In 2013 mental disorders topped the list of most costly conditions, with spending at $201 billion.", "The 1976 Supreme Court decision in Estelle v. Gamble declared that jails must provide medical treatment to detainees consistent with community standards of care. Yet despite their important role providing health care to about ten million people a year, jails remain largely siloed from the surrounding health care community, compromising inmates' health and adding to health care spending. Health information technology promises solutions. The current policy landscape, shaped by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act and the Affordable Care Act, is favorable to jails' implementation of health information technology (IT). In this article we examine how decisions largely external to jails\u2014coming from the Supreme Court, Congress, and local policy makers\u2014have contributed to the growth of health IT within jails and health information exchange between jails and local communities. We also discuss privacy concerns under the Health Insurance Portability and Affordability Act and other legislation. This article highlights a rare confluence of events that could improve the health of an overlooked population.", "A small but growing population of children with medical complexity, many of whom are covered by Medicaid, accounts for a high proportion of pediatric health care spending. We first describe the expenditures for children with medical complexity insured by Medicaid across the care continuum. We report the increasingly large amount of spending on hospital care for these children, relative to the small amount of primary care and home care spending. We then present a business case that estimates how cost savings might be achieved for children with medical complexity from potential reductions in hospital and emergency department use and shows how the savings could underwrite investments in outpatient and community care. We conclude by discussing the importance of these findings in the context of Medicaid\u2019s quality of care and health care reform.", "In developed nations that rely on multiple, competing health insurers-for example, Switzerland and Germany-the prices for health care services and products are subject to uniform price schedules that are either set by government or negotiated on a regional basis between associations of health insurers and associations of providers of health care. In the United States, some states-notably Maryland-have used such all-payer systems for hospitals only. Elsewhere in the United States, prices are negotiated between individual payers and providers. This situation has resulted in an opaque system in which payers with market power force weaker payers to cover disproportionate shares of providers' fixed costs-a phenomenon sometimes termed cost shifting-or providers simply succeed in charging higher prices when they can. In this article I propose that this price-discriminatory system be replaced over time by an all-payer system as a means to better control costs and ensure equitable payment.", "Public health agencies face difficult decisions when allocating scarce resources to control the spread of HIV/AIDS. Decisions are often made with few local empirical data. We demonstrated the use of the robust decision making approach in Los Angeles County, an approach that is data driven and allows decision makers to compare the performance of various intervention strategies across thousands of simulated future scenarios. We found that the prevailing strategy of emphasizing behavioral risk reduction interventions was unlikely to achieve the policy goals of the national HIV/AIDS strategy. Of the alternative strategies we examined, those that invested most heavily in interventions to initiate antiretroviral treatment and support treatment adherence were the most likely to achieve policy objectives. By employing similar methods, other public health agencies can identify robust strategies and invest in interventions more likely to achieve HIV/AIDS policy goals.", "A common assumption is that hospitals have little control over their costs and must charge high rates to private health insurers when Medicare rates are lower than hospital costs. We present evidence that contradicts that common assumption. Hospitals with strong market power and higher private-payer and other revenues appear to have less pressure to constrain their costs. Thus, these hospitals have higher costs per unit of service, which can lead to losses on Medicare patients. Hospitals under more financial pressure--with less market share and less ability to charge higher private rates--often constrain costs and can generate profits on Medicare patients.", "Major US employers have great influence on the health care system because of the large number of employees for whom they provide health benefits and the billions of dollars they spend on health care. These companies must find ways to promote and improve health and health care, including by addressing racial and ethnic disparities. The communications company Verizon 38 percent of whose workforce is made up of racial and ethnic minorities, does so through a variety of initiatives to educate employees and to partner with health plans to increase screenings, care management, and other interventions. These initiatives include on-site mammography screening for employees; mailings that describe heightened breast cancer risks for minority populations; and data analysis to determine whether special programs should be put in place to target cardiovascular and other disease risks for racial and ethnic minorities. Between 200 and 300 female employees each year for the past three years have been screened at Verizon for breast cancer as a result, and the company is carrying out additional analyses to determine the impact on morbidity, mortality, and spending for that and other programs.", "Trade-offs may exist between investments to promote health system strengthening, such as investments in facilities and training, and the rapid scale-up of HIV/AIDS services. We analyzed trends in expenditures to support the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Kenya under the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) from 2005 to 2010. We examined how expenditures changed over time, considering health system strengthening alongside direct treatment of patients. We focused on two organizations carrying out contracts under PEPFAR: the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation and FHI360 (formerly Family Health International), a nonprofit health and development organization. We found that the average unit expenditure, or the spending on goods and services per mother living with HIV who was provided with antiretroviral drugs, declined by 52 percent, from $567 to $271, during this time period. The unit expenditure per mother-to-infant transmission averted declined by 66 percent, from $7,117 to $2,440. Meanwhile, the health system strengthening proportion of unit expenditure increased from 12 percent to 33 percent during the same time period. The analysis suggests that PEPFAR investments in prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Kenya became more efficient over time, and that there was no strong evidence of a trade-off between scaling up services and investing in health systems.", "There may once have been a time when doctors unquestioningly accepted the government's declaration of a drug's effectiveness and when patients unquestioningly accepted the prescriptions of their doctors. That time has passed. Now, information--good and bad--showers from all directions on patients and physicians alike. A filter is needed, and peer review provides the best one. But who or what is this validated information for? Ethically, its primary purpose is to enable patients to make decisions consistent with their values. Providing vetted information in a form that is useful to patients requires an emphasis on comprehensible, comprehensive, trustworthy, verifiable, and transparent communication. The hypothetical comparative effectiveness case study in this month's Health Affairs does not appear to rise to the level that would be helpful to providers or patients.", "Despite many changes made in 2010 and 2011 to Medicare's payment system for short-term stays in skilled nursing facilities, a flawed payment structure continues to underpay facilities for certain types of patients and overpay for others. The flaws in the payment structure create incentives to selectively admit or refuse patients based on the type and complexity of their conditions, while payments that vary with level of use encourage providers to furnish therapy services, such as rehabilitation care, that some patients might not need. We propose an alternative payment design and demonstrate that it would dampen such incentives by making payments that are more closely matched to costs and based on characteristics of the patients treated. We propose replacing the existing therapy component of payment with one that varies payments according to the expected care needs of the patient and adding a separate payment component that covers drugs and other nontherapy ancillary services, such as support for patients on ventilators. We also propose adding an outlier policy to provide additional reimbursement for patients requiring exceptionally high-cost care.", "The rising medical costs associated with cancer have led to considerable financial hardship for patients and their families in the United States. Using data from the LIVESTRONG 2012 survey of 4,719 cancer survivors ages 18\u201364, we examined the proportions of survivors who reported going into debt or filing for bankruptcy as a result of cancer, as well as the amount of debt incurred. Approximately one-third of the survivors had gone into debt, and 3 percent had filed for bankruptcy. Of those who had gone into debt, 55 percent incurred obligations of $10,000 or more. Cancer survivors who were younger, had lower incomes, and had public health insurance were more likely to go into debt or file for bankruptcy, compared to those who were older, had higher incomes, and had private insurance, respectively. Future longitudinal population-based studies are needed to improve understanding of financial hardship among US working-age cancer survivors throughout the cancer care trajectory and, ultimately, to help stakeholders develop evidence-based interventions and policies to reduce the financial hardship of cancer.", "Pharmacists can affect the delivery of primary care by addressing the challenges of medication therapy management. Most office visits involve medications for chronic conditions and require assessment of medication effectiveness, the cost of therapies, and patients' adherence with medication regimens. Pharmacists are often underused in conducting these activities. They perform comprehensive therapy reviews of prescribed and self-care medications, resolve medication-related problems, optimize complex regimens, design adherence programs, and recommend cost-effective therapies. Pharmacists should play key roles as team members in medical homes, and their potential to serve effectively in this role should be evaluated as part of medical home demonstration projects.", "Prescription drugs are a major source of US health care expenditure. \u201cMe too\u201d brand-name medications contribute to the cost of drugs, which is substantial for consumers. In 2013 patient copayments averaged 10.5 times more for two commonly prescribed brand-name medications versus generic therapeutic alternatives.", "Value-based insurance is a relatively new approach to health insurance in which financial barriers, such as copayments, are lowered for clinical services that are considered high value, while consumer cost sharing may be increased for services considered to be of uncertain value. Such plans are complex and do not easily fit into the simplified, consumer-friendly comparison tools that many state health insurance exchanges are formulating for use in 2014. Nevertheless some states and plans are attempting to strike the right balance between a streamlined health exchange shopping experience and innovative, albeit complex, benefit design that promotes value. For example, agencies administering exchanges in Vermont and Oregon are contemplating offering value-based insurance plans as an option in addition to a set of standardized plans. In the postreform environment, policy makers must find ways to present complex value-based insurance plans in a way that consumers and employers can more readily understand.", "The Affordable Care Act includes provisions to increase the value obtained from health care spending. A growing concern among health policy experts is that new Medicare policies designed to improve the quality and efficiency of hospital care, such as value-based purchasing (VBP), the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP), and electronic health record (EHR) meaningful-use criteria, will disproportionately affect safety-net hospitals, which are already facing reduced disproportionate-share hospital (DSH) payments under both Medicare and Medicaid. We examined hospitals in California to determine whether safety-net institutions were more likely than others to incur penalties under these programs. To assess quality, we also examined whether mortality outcomes were different at these hospitals. Our study found that compared to non-safety-net hospitals, safety-net institutions had lower thirty-day risk-adjusted mortality rates in the period 2009-11 for acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia and marginally lower adjusted Medicare costs. Nonetheless, safety-net hospitals were more likely than others to be penalized under the VBP program and the HRRP and more likely not to meet EHR meaningful-use criteria. The combined effects of Medicare value-based payment policies on the financial viability of safety-net hospitals need to be considered along with DSH payment cuts as national policy makers further incorporate performance measures into the overall payment system.", "Unprecedented change in the US health care system is being driven by the rapid uptake of health information technology and national investments in multi-institution research networks comprising academic centers, health care delivery systems, and other health system components. An example of this changing landscape is Optum Labs, a novel network \u201cnode\u201d that is bringing together new partners, data, and analytic techniques to implement research findings in health care practice. Optum Labs was founded in early 2013 by Mayo Clinic and Optum, a commercial data, infrastructure services, and care organization that is part of UnitedHealth Group. Optum Labs now has eleven collaborators and a database of deidentified information on more than 150 million people that is compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996. This article describes the early progress of Optum Labs. The combination of the diverse collaborator perspectives with rich data, including deep patient and provider information, is intended to reveal new insights about diseases, treatments, and patients\u2019 behavior to guide changes in practice. Practitioners\u2019 involvement in agenda setting and translation of findings into practical care innovations accelerates the implementation of research results. Furthermore, feedback loops from the clinic help Optum Labs expand on successes and give quick attention to challenges as they emerge.", "Strong primary care systems are often viewed as the bedrock of health care systems that provide high-quality care, but the evidence supporting this view is somewhat limited. We analyzed comparative primary care data collected in 2009-10 as part of a European Union-funded project, the Primary Health Care Activity Monitor for Europe. Our analysis showed that strong primary care was associated with better population health; lower rates of unnecessary hospitalizations; and relatively lower socioeconomic inequality, as measured by an indicator linking education levels to self-rated health. Overall health expenditures were higher in countries with stronger primary care structures, perhaps because maintaining strong primary care structures is costly and promotes developments such as decentralization of services delivery. Comprehensive primary care was also associated with slower growth in health care spending. More research is needed to explore these associations further, even as the evidence grows that strong primary care in Europe is conducive to reaching important health system goals.", "National policies to improve health care quality have largely focused on clinical provider outcomes and, more recently, payment reform. Yet the association between hospital leadership and quality, although crucial to driving quality improvement, has not been explored in depth. We collected data from surveys of nationally representative groups of hospitals in the United States and England to examine the relationships among hospital boards, management practices of front-line managers, and the quality of care delivered. First, we found that hospitals with more effective management practices provided higher-quality care. Second, higher-rated hospital boards had superior performance by hospital management staff. Finally, we identified two signatures of high-performing hospital boards and management practice. Hospitals with boards that paid greater attention to clinical quality had management that better monitored quality performance. Similarly, we found that hospitals with boards that used clinical quality metrics more effectively had higher performance by hospital management staff on target setting and operations. These findings help increase understanding of the dynamics among boards, front-line management, and quality of care and could provide new targets for improving care delivery.", "Diseases that disproportionately affect developing countries play a large role in stalling economic and social development. Pharmaceutical companies are driving crucial research into new vaccines and medicines; however, although there is an imperative for industry to research new therapies for diseases of the poor, the financial returns are often seen as limited. This is beginning to change. The pharmaceutical industry and the public sector are thinking differently than before about how to improve access to medicines and advance research and development for neglected diseases. The public and private sectors must work together to develop a wide range of innovative tools, partnerships, and approaches.", "The Affordable Care Act's regulation of medical loss ratios requires health insurers to use at least 80\u201385 percent of the premiums they collect for direct medical expenses (care delivery) or for efforts to improve the quality of care. To gauge this rule's effect on insurers' financial performance, we measured changes between 2010 and 2011 in key financial ratios reflecting insurers' operating profits, administrative costs, and medical claims. We found that the largest changes occurred in the individual market, where for-profit insurers reduced their median administrative cost ratio and operating margin by more than two percentage points each, resulting in a seven-percentage-point increase in their median medical loss ratio. Financial ratios changed much less for insurers in the small- and large-group markets.", "Congress is again attempting to repeal the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula. The formula is a failed mechanism intended to constrain Medicare Part B physician spending by adjusting annual physician fee updates. Congress has averted formula-driven physician fee cuts each year beginning in 2003 by overriding the SGR, usually accompanied with last-minute disputes about how these overrides should be paid for. Last year Congress achieved bipartisan and bicameral agreement on legislation to replace the SGR\u2014the SGR Repeal and Medicare Provider Payment Modernization Act of 2014, which we refer to as the \"2014 SGR fix\"\u2014but was unable to find a way to pay for the legislation under current budget rules. Current congressional deliberations appear focused on how to pay for the fix, with wide consensus that the 2014 legislation should remain the basic model for reform. We describe key features of the 2014 SGR fix, place it in the context of both past and ongoing Medicare health policy, assess its strengths and weaknesses as a mechanism to foster improved care and lower costs in Medicare, and suggest further actions to ensure success in meeting these goals.", "Tens of billions of dollars\u2014both public and private\u2014flow to low-income communities each year, mostly for affordable housing. However, it is rare for the health effects of these investments to be assessed. In San Francisco, California, a collaborative effort is under way that aims to fill this research gap while helping residents of Sunnydale, the city's largest public housing project, where poverty, violence, and truancy are entrenched. The collaboration is in its earliest stages\u2014with construction not scheduled to start for at least four years\u2014but some early lessons have emerged. For example, researchers and community developers have found that their data collection needs and timeline expectations often don't match. Nevertheless, the collaborators intend to use the long period before groundbreaking to establish baseline measurements of residents' social and physical well-being, plan initiatives in collaboration with community members and stakeholders, and seek funding for the initiatives and a longitudinal evaluation of the community.", "For 2011-13, US health spending is projected to grow at 4.0 percent, on average--slightly above the historically low growth rate of 3.8 percent in 2009. Preliminary data suggest that growth in consumers' use of health services remained slow in 2011, and this pattern is expected to continue this year and next. In 2014, health spending growth is expected to accelerate to 7.4 percent as the major coverage expansions from the Affordable Care Act begin. For 2011 through 2021, national health spending is projected to grow at an average rate of 5.7 percent annually, which would be 0.9 percentage point faster than the expected annual increase in the gross domestic product during this period. By 2021, federal, state, and local government health care spending is projected to be nearly 50 percent of national health expenditures, up from 46 percent in 2011, with federal spending accounting for about two-thirds of the total government share. Rising government spending on health care is expected to be driven by faster growth in Medicare enrollment, expanded Medicaid coverage, and the introduction of premium and cost-sharing subsidies for health insurance exchange plans.", "As norms of comparative effectiveness research are sought within the biomedical and health care communities, and the science of conducting and interpreting this research develops, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must balance diverse interests. The agency\u2019s overarching interest is the development of high-quality comparative effectiveness information that contributes to improved patient care. To further this interest, the FDA can provide expertise in trial design and postmarketing surveillance. The FDA can also ensure that manufacturers of medical products use comparative effectiveness information in product promotion in a manner consistent with regulatory requirements. In this article we observe that these requirements would preclude the manufacturer\u2019s use in a promotional context of comparative effectiveness findings derived from an observational study. The FDA recognizes, however, that there are ongoing efforts to address the methodological problems inherent in observational approaches and to foster consensus on enhanced methods. The FDA must work to navigate challenges that relate to both the science of comparative effectiveness research and the agency\u2019s statutory responsibilities to the public health.", "Comparative effectiveness research to date has focused primarily on the diagnosis and treatment of diseases and injuries in individuals. Yet the greatest drivers of people's overall health are found in their social and physical environments. We recommend that the comparative effectiveness research agenda focus on the public health issues responsible for the greatest overall illness and death levels, such as programs to increase high school graduation rates, which are strongly associated with improvements in long-term illness and death rates. In so doing, the agenda should spotlight efforts to address widely recognized social and environmental determinants of health, such as improving access to early childhood development programs and education, as well as interventions aimed at affecting climate change and addressing behavioral risk factors such as smoking. We also urge federal health agencies to invest in further development of methods to compare public health interventions and to use those methods to conduct the studies.", "The value of \"specialty pharmaceuticals\" for cancer and other complex conditions depends not merely on their molecular structures but also on the manner in which the drugs are assessed, insured, priced, prescribed, and used. This article analyzes the five principal stages through which a specialty drug must pass on its journey from the laboratory to the bedside. These include regulatory approval by the Food and Drug Administration for market access, insurance coverage, pricing and payment, physician prescription, and patient engagement. If structured appropriately, each stage improves performance and supports continued research and development. If structured inappropriately, however, each stage adds to administrative burdens, distorts clinical decision making, and weakens incentives for innovation. Cautious optimism is in order, but neither the continued development of breakthrough products nor their use according to evidence-based guidelines can be taken for granted."], "label": ["unimpactful", "impactful", "unimpactful", "impactful", "impactful", "unimpactful", "impactful", "impactful", "unimpactful", "unimpactful", "unimpactful", "unimpactful", "unimpactful", "unimpactful", "impactful", "impactful", "unimpactful", "unimpactful", "impactful", "impactful", "impactful", "impactful", "unimpactful", "unimpactful", "unimpactful", "unimpactful", "impactful", "unimpactful", "unimpactful", "unimpactful"]}
