        "Background Children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) are predisposed to developing leg ulcers in early adolescence; however, the underlying physiologic mechanisms are not well understood, which hinders the development of prophylactic antiulcer interventions. Purpose To determine if occlusive arterial disease or abnormal hemodynamics exist in the lower limb peripheral arteries of children with SCA. Materials and Methods This was a prospective cross-sectional study conducted between July 2020 and May 2021. Two groups of participants were enrolled: children with SCA and healthy controls. Each child had their anthropometric measurements taken, followed by B-mode, color Doppler, and spectral Doppler US evaluation of the distal anterior and posterior tibial arteries. Ankle-brachial index evaluation was also performed. Hemodynamic values were compared between children with SCA and healthy controls, with statistical significance set at the P < .05 level. Results Forty-five children with SCA (mean age, 9.5 years \u00b1 3.7 [SD]; 26 boys) and 45 healthy controls (mean age, 9.3 years \u00b1 3.8; 25 boys) were evaluated. Children with SCA had higher peak systolic velocities, end-diastolic velocities, and blood volume flow in their distal anterior and posterior tibial arteries compared with the healthy participants (P < .001 across all 12 measurements). Children with SCA also had lower resistive index and pulsatility index values compared with healthy controls in at least one of the anterior and posterior tibial arteries bilaterally. Monophasic spectral patterns were exclusively observed in participants with SCA. The ankle-brachial index values for the participants with SCA (mean, 1.09 \u00b1 0.08) and healthy participants (mean, 1.06 \u00b1 0.02) were within normal range. Conclusion Abnormal peripheral hemodynamic characteristics were found in the lower limbs of children with sickle cell anemia. No evidence of occlusive peripheral artery disease was present. \u00a9 RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article. See also the editorial by Paltiel in this issue.",
        "An 11-year-old girl presented to the pediatric gastroenterology outpatient department of our institution with gradually increasing painless abdominal distention. The distention started 2 years earlier and was not associated with any other constitutional symptoms, vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice, hematemesis, or melaena. She reported early satiety and heaviness in the lower abdomen. The abdominal swelling was predominantly in the infraumbilical region and was soft at palpation. She was the first child of nonconsanguineous parents and had an uneventful perinatal course after a normal vaginal delivery. Her developmental milestones were normal. She had an average scholastic performance at school. There was no history of visual problems, seizures, or inappropriate behaviors. She had an early menarche 2 years previously. Her menstrual cycles were regular, and there was no abnormal vaginal discharge. Her breast development was normal (Tanner stage III), while pubic and axillary hair were absent (Tanner stage I). She was short for her age (104 cm; normal range, 120-154 cm). There was no history of short stature among her siblings or parents. Laboratory investigations were performed to measure thyroid-stimulating hormone (1354.34 \u03bcIU/mL; normal range, 0.35-5.5 \u03bcIU/mL), triiodothyronine (<2.5 ng/dL [0.0385 pmol/L]; normal range, 100-200 ng/dL [1.54-3.08 pmol/L]), thyroxine (1.35 \u03bcg/dL [17.37 nmol/L]; normal range, 5-12 \u03bcg/dL [64.35-154.44 nmol/L]), \u03b2-human chorionic gonadotropin (<1.2 mIU/mL; normal, <5 mIU/mL), luteinizing hormone (0.08 mIU/mL; normal range, 0.1-6.0 mIU/mL), and follicle-stimulating hormone (6.93 mIU/mL; normal range, 0.3-2.0 mIU/mL) levels. Complete blood count was normal. An abdominal mass was suspected, and abdominopelvic CT was performed and followed by US; these examinations revealed multiple large cysts in both ovaries (Figs 1, 2A, 2B). The uterus was pubertal in shape, and endometrial thickness was 9 mm, representing normal follicular phase measurement. Serum CA-125 and inhibin levels were normal. To evaluate short stature, radiographs of the hand (Fig 3) and pelvis (Fig 3B) were obtained as part of a limited skeletal survey, keeping in mind the possible skeletal changes associated with hypothyroidism. In view of the hypothyroidism, US of neck was also performed (Fig 4). Treatment was started based on the clinical and radiologic parameters, and the child's condition improved with medical treatment.",
        "History A 70-year-old man had a posterior left thigh lesion confirmed to be biopsy-proven melanoma. The patient underwent wide excision and sentinel node biopsy, which showed absence of residual melanoma. Two years later, the patient noticed a subcentimeter subcutaneous lump in his thigh. Repeat excisional biopsy showed involvement of the surrounding soft tissue, consistent with a satellite lesion. Follow-up combined PET/CT revealed satellite nodules around the primary lesion, enabling confirmation of subcutaneous metastatic disease. The patient was subsequently started on nivolumab, an anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor that blocks PD-1 and is approved as a first-line treatment in patients with advanced metastatic melanoma. On the baseline scan prior to starting nivolumab, there were no CT findings that suggested metastatic disease, nor were there enlarged mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes. Five months after initiation of nivolumab treatment, the first follow-up chest CT scan was performed and showed new findings in the mediastinum (Fig 1) and bilateral lungs (Figs 2, 3). The patient remained asymptomatic during the treatment period. Furthermore, the subcutaneous metastatic disease remained stable during the treatment period, and no other site of metastatic disease was noted on follow-up CT scans obtained during the first 5 months of treatment. The patient had no prior history of infectious or occupational exposures. During the nivolumab treatment cycle, his pertinent laboratory values and physical examination findings were unremarkable.",
        "Purpose To develop and test an artificial intelligence (AI) system, based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for automated real-time triaging of adult chest radiographs on the basis of the urgency of imaging appearances. Materials and Methods An AI system was developed by using 470 388 fully anonymized institutional adult chest radiographs acquired from 2007 to 2017. The free-text radiology reports were preprocessed by using an in-house natural language processing (NLP) system modeling radiologic language. The NLP system analyzed the free-text report to prioritize each radiograph as critical, urgent, nonurgent, or normal. An AI system for computer vision using an ensemble of two deep CNNs was then trained by using labeled radiographs to predict the clinical priority from radiologic appearances only. The system's performance in radiograph prioritization was tested in a simulation by using an independent set of 15 887 radiographs. Prediction performance was assessed with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were also determined. Nonparametric testing of the improvement in time to final report was determined at a nominal significance level of 5%. Results Normal chest radiographs were detected by our AI system with a sensitivity of 71%, specificity of 95%, PPV of 73%, and NPV of 94%. The average reporting delay was reduced from 11.2 to 2.7 days for critical imaging findings (P < .001) and from 7.6 to 4.1 days for urgent imaging findings (P < .001) in the simulation compared with historical data. Conclusion Automated real-time triaging of adult chest radiographs with use of an artificial intelligence system is feasible, with clinically acceptable performance. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "History A 43-year-old right-handed man presented with a history of progressive mild left-sided weakness and slowness of movements. Symptoms began 4 years earlier, and the patient noticed a progressive decline in his daily routine due to gait difficulties in the past year. There was no history of head trauma, surgery, drug therapy, smoking, or alcohol abuse, nor was there any relevant family history. Examination revealed normal cognition (29 of 30 points on the Mini-Mental State Examination and 27 of 30 points on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment) and normal cerebellar, sensory, cranial nerve, and autonomic function. There was mild left-sided weakness involving the upper and lower limbs (medical research council graded muscle strength as 4+ out of 5) that was associated with facial hypomimia and a rigid akinetic syndrome only in the patient's left hemibody (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale [UPDRS] part III [motor examination], 23 out of 52 points). Mild atrophy in the left upper and lower limbs without pain, swelling, or skin lesions was noted at physical examination. Routine blood chemistry was normal, as were serum creatine kinase and aldolase levels and thyroid, hepatic, and renal function. T1- and T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, diffusion- and perfusion-weighted, and contrast material-enhanced brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging results were normal, without basal ganglia hyperintensity, lacunae, calcification, or heavy metal deposits. Muscle MR imaging and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with technetium 99m (99mTc) tropane dopamine transporter (TRODAT)-1 were performed for further evaluation. This patient received levodopa and benserazide (200 and 50 mg, respectively) four times a day and amantadine (100 mg) three times a day without adequate improvement (UPDRS score decreased from 23 to 20 points).",
        "Background: Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is the most common genetic cause of illness and death in the world, with Africa bearing the highest burden. Trans-cranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) which is different from transfontanelle ultrasound, was used to measure mean flow velocities in the large intra-cranial arteries. It is a readily available, economical, reliable, non invasive method of imaging and has been shown to predict risk of stroke when cerebral blood flow velocity> 200cm/s.\r\nAim & Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the common findings in TCD in children with Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA) in this environment, the associated various risk factors and to identify the high risk patients who are likely to have primary stroke.\r\nMaterials and Methods: This prospective study was conducted on 200 children with SCA, without a known history of stroke, at the Sickle Cell Foundation Nigeria, Lagos over a period of 6 months. A TCD machine - DWL Doppler box (Scan Med) s/n DB-0563, p/n 301748 \u00ae manufactured in Germany and equipped with a 2MHz transducer probe was used to measure the cerebral blood flow (CBFv) in internal carotid artery (ICA), middle cerebral artery (MCA) and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanterior cerebral artery (ACA). Measurements were entered into the data sheet and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science Software (SPSS) version 20.\r\nResults showed that the 5-8years age group constituted 43.5% of those screened, 25% was under 4 years of age, 24% were 9-12 years and 7.5% were 13-16 years. Females were 56.5% while 43.5% were males. They were grouped according to CBFv in the analyzed vessels. The standard risk (CBFv  200cm/s) was 3.5%.\r\nConclusion: Significant correlation was noted between haematocrit and Time Averaged Mean of the Maximum Velocity (TAMMV), with a p-value of 0.045, white blood cell and TAMMV (p- value of 0.032) and dactylitis and TAMMV (p-value of 0.007). Also a significant negative correlation was shown between children below 4years and dactylitis (p-value 0.026).",
        "Purpose To determine the accuracy of dual-energy computed tomographic (CT) quantitation in a phantom system comparing fast kilovolt peak-switching, dual-source, split-filter, sequential-scanning, and dual-layer detector systems. Materials and Methods A large elliptical phantom containing iodine (2, 5, and 15 mg/mL), simulated contrast material-enhanced blood, and soft-tissue inserts with known elemental compositions was scanned three to five times with seven dual-energy CT systems and a total of 10 kilovolt peak settings. Monochromatic images (50, 70, and 140 keV) and iodine concentration images were created. Mean iodine concentration and monochromatic attenuation for each insert and reconstruction energy level were recorded. Measurement bias was assessed by using the sum of the mean signed errors measured across relevant inserts for each monochromatic energy level and iodine concentration. Iodine and monochromatic errors were assessed by using the root sum of the squared error of all measurements. Results At least one acquisition paradigm per scanner had iodine biases (range, -2.6 to 1.5 mg/mL) with significant differences from zero. There were no significant differences in iodine error (range, 0.44-1.70 mg/mL) among the top five acquisition paradigms (one fast kilovolt peak switching, three dual source, and one sequential scanning). Monochromatic bias was smallest for 70 keV (-12.7 to 15.8 HU) and largest for 50 keV (-80.6 to 35.2 HU). There were no significant differences in monochromatic error (range, 11.4-52.0 HU) among the top three acquisition paradigms (one dual source and two fast kilovolt peak switching). The lowest accuracy for both measures was with a split-filter system. Conclusion Iodine and monochromatic accuracy varies among systems, but dual-source and fast kilovolt-switching generally provided the most accurate results in a large phantom. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "HistoryA 55-year-old man with a history of chronic pancreatitis secondary to chronic alcohol abuse presented to the hospital with acute abdominal pain, generalized weakness, weight loss, and pyrexia. A clinical examination revealed he was tender to touch in the upper abdomen. Laboratory tests revealed a serum alkaline phosphatase level of 370 U/L (6.1 \u00b5kat/L) (normal range, 30-130 U/L [0.5-2.2 \u00b5kat/L]), a lipase level of 172 U/L (2.9 \u00b5kat/L) (normal range, 0-60 U/L [0-1.0 \u00b5kat/L]), a C-reactive protein level of 159 mg/L (1514 nmol/L) (normal value, <8.0 mg/L [76.2 nmol/L]), and a white cell count of 7 \u00d7 109/L (normal range, [4-11] \u00d7 109/L). During the present admission, the patient underwent urgent CT for his acute symptoms. His relevant medical history included a hospital admission 2 months earlier for abdominal discomfort. Given his history of chronic pancreatitis, baseline abdominal MRI was performed to determine the cause of his symptoms and to assess the pancreas.",
        "Background Fluorine 18 (18F)-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT is a routine tool for staging patients with lymphoma and lung cancer. Purpose To evaluate configurations of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to localize and classify uptake patterns of whole-body 18F-FDG PET/CT images in patients with lung cancer and lymphoma. Materials and Methods This was a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients with lung cancer or lymphoma referred to a single center from August 2011 to August 2013. Two nuclear medicine experts manually delineated foci with increased 18F-FDG uptake, specified the anatomic location, and classified these findings as suspicious for tumor or metastasis or nonsuspicious. By using these expert readings as the reference standard, a CNN was developed to detect foci positive for 18F-FDG uptake, predict the anatomic location, and determine the expert classification. Examinations were divided into independent training (60%), validation (20%), and test (20%) subsets. Results This study included 629 patients (mean age, 52.2 years \u00b1 20.4 [standard deviation]; 394 men). There were 302 patients with lung cancer and 327 patients with lymphoma. For the test set (123 patients; 10 782 foci), the CNN areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) for determining hypermetabolic 18F-FDG PET/CT foci that were suspicious for cancer versus nonsuspicious by using the five input features were as follows: CT alone, 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.72, 0.83); 18F-FDG PET alone, 0.97 (95% CI: 0.97, 0.98); 18F-FDG PET/CT, 0.98 (95% CI: 0.97, 0.99); 18F-FDG PET/CT maximum intensity projection (MIP), 0.98 (95% CI: 0.98, 0.99); and 18F-FDG PET/CT MIP atlas, 0.99 (95% CI: 0.98, 1.00). The combination of 18F-FDG PET and CT information improved overall classification accuracy (AUC, 0.975 vs 0.981, respectively; P < .001). Anatomic localization accuracy of the CNN was 2543 of 2639 (96.4%; 95% CI: 95.5%, 97.1%) for body part, 2292 of 2639 (86.9%; 95% CI: 85.3%, 88.5%) for region (ie, organ), and 2149 of 2639 (81.4%; 95% CI: 79.3%-83.5%) for subregion. Conclusion The fully automated anatomic localization and classification of fluorine 18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET uptake patterns in foci suspicious and nonsuspicious for cancer in patients with lung cancer and lymphoma by using a convolutional neural network is feasible and achieves high diagnostic performance when both CT and PET images are used. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "The Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System (O-RADS) US risk stratification and management system is designed to provide consistent interpretations, to decrease or eliminate ambiguity in US reports resulting in a higher probability of accuracy in assigning risk of malignancy to ovarian and other adnexal masses, and to provide a management recommendation for each risk category. It was developed by an international multidisciplinary committee sponsored by the American College of Radiology and applies the standardized reporting tool for US based on the 2018 published lexicon of the O-RADS US working group. For risk stratification, the O-RADS US system recommends six categories (O-RADS 0-5), incorporating the range of normal to high risk of malignancy. This unique system represents a collaboration between the pattern-based approach commonly used in North America and the widely used, European-based, algorithmic-style International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) Assessment of Different Neoplasias in the Adnexa model system, a risk prediction model that has undergone successful prospective and external validation. The pattern approach relies on a subgroup of the most predictive descriptors in the lexicon based on a retrospective review of evidence prospectively obtained in the IOTA phase 1-3 prospective studies and other supporting studies that assist in differentiating management schemes in a variety of almost certainly benign lesions. With O-RADS US working group consensus, guidelines for management in the different risk categories are proposed. Both systems have been stratified to reach the same risk categories and management strategies regardless of which is initially used. At this time, O-RADS US is the only lexicon and classification system that encompasses all risk categories with their associated management schemes.",
        "Purpose To determine if commonly administered doses of technetium 99m (99mTc) mertiatide (MAG3) in the range of 300\u2013370 MBq (approximately 8\u201310 mCi) contribute to image interpretation and justify the resulting radiation exposure. Materials and Methods The respective institutional review boards approved this HIPAA-compliant study and waived informed consent. Baseline and furosemide 99mTc-MAG3 imaging examinations in 50 patients suspected of having renal obstruction and 48 patients suspected of having renovascular hypertension (RVH) were randomly selected from archived databases and were independently scored by three experienced readers without access to 2-second flow images. Readers were blinded to their original scores, and then they rescored each examination with access to high-activity 2-second flow images. Relative renal function was determined after a low activity (62.9 MBq \u00b1 40.7) baseline acquisition for RVH and a high activity (303.4 MBq \u00b1 48.1) acquisition after administration of enalaprilat. Data were analyzed by using random effects analysis of variance and mean and standard error of the mean for the difference between sets of scores and the difference between relative function measurements. Results There was no significant difference in the scores without flow images compared with blinded scores with high-activity flow images for patients suspected of having obstruction (P = .80) or RVH (P = .24). Moreover, there was no significant difference in the relative uptake measurements after administration of low and high activities (P > .99). Conclusion Administered doses of 99mTc-MAG3 in the range of 300\u2013370 MBq (approximately 8\u201310 mCi) do not affect the relative function measurements or contribute to interpretation of images in patients suspected of having RVH or obstruction compared with administration of lower doses; unnecessary radiation exposure can be avoided by administering doses in the range of 37\u2013185 MBq as recommended incurrent guidelines. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017",
        "History An 8-month-old previously healthy boy was referred to our institution by the maternal child health center for progressive truncal hypotonia and developmental delay. This infant was born after an uncomplicated pregnancy with no perinatal complications. He was delivered at full term via spontaneous vaginal delivery. Two of his older male siblings died around 2\u20133 years of age due to pneumonia. According to the parents, these siblings also displayed reduced muscle tone, and one of them developed recurrent seizure. On physical examination, the child showed marked head lag and did not reach out to objects. Visual and auditory development were normal. His head circumference was below the third percentile, and his body weight was at the 10th percentile. His hair was sparse and coarse. A mild pectus excavatum deformity was present. Skull and chest radiographs were obtained (Figs 1, 2), and the patient underwent MRI of the brain (Fig 3).",
        "History A 17-year-old white male adolescent was re-evaluated for a withheld cardiac condition initially detected during prenatal imaging at an outside institution. He had previously experienced intermittent episodes of shortness of breath, chest pain, and palpitations with exertion, but more recently he had been asymptomatic. He had no other comorbidities and no family history of congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, or sudden cardiac death. At physical examination, the patient had a grade II/IV rumbling systolic murmur best heard at the left upper sternal border. Otherwise, cardiovascular and other physical examination findings were normal. An electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia and nonspecific T wave changes. A graded exercise stress test was normal. Cardiac MRI was performed without and with gadolinium-based contrast material. Multiple echocardiograms obtained since birth, cardiac MR images obtained 2 and 4 years earlier, and nongated CT images obtained with iodinated contrast material to evaluate trauma 8 years prior showed findings similar to those of the current examination. Prior chest radiographs (not shown) were normal, and angiography performed when the patient was 4 years old revealed normal coronary arteries.",
        "Background Current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) radiologic literature is dominated by CT, and a detailed description of chest radiography appearances in relation to the disease time course is lacking. Purpose To describe the time course and severity of findings of COVID-19 at chest radiography and correlate these with real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2, nucleic acid. Materials and Methods This is a retrospective study of patients with COVID-19 confirmed by using RT-PCR and chest radiographic examinations who were admitted across four hospitals and evaluated between January and March 2020. Baseline and serial chest radiographs (n = 255) were reviewed with RT-PCR. Correlation with concurrent CT examinations (n = 28) was performed when available. Two radiologists scored each chest radiograph in consensus for consolidation, ground-glass opacity, location, and pleural fluid. A severity index was determined for each lung. The lung scores were summed to produce the final severity score. Results The study was composed of 64 patients (26 men; mean age, 56 years \u00b1 19 [standard deviation]). Of these, 58 patients had initial positive findings with RT-PCR (91%; 95% confidence interval: 81%, 96%), 44 patients had abnormal findings at baseline chest radiography (69%; 95% confidence interval: 56%, 80%), and 38 patients had initial positive findings with RT-PCR testing and abnormal findings at baseline chest radiography (59%; 95% confidence interval: 46%, 71%). Six patients (9%) showed abnormalities at chest radiography before eventually testing positive for COVID-19 with RT-PCR. Sensitivity of initial RT-PCR (91%; 95% confidence interval: 83%, 97%) was higher than that of baseline chest radiography (69%; 95% confidence interval: 56%, 80%) (P = .009). Radiographic recovery (mean, 6 days \u00b1 5) and virologic recovery (mean, 8 days \u00b1 6) were not significantly different (P = .33). Consolidation was the most common finding (30 of 64; 47%) followed by ground-glass opacities (21 of 64; 33%). Abnormalities at chest radiography had a peripheral distribution (26 of 64; 41%) and lower zone distribution (32 of 64; 50%) with bilateral involvement (32 of 64; 50%). Pleural effusion was uncommon (two of 64; 3%). The severity of findings at chest radiography peaked at 10\u201312 days from the date of symptom onset. Conclusion Findings at chest radiography in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 frequently showed bilateral lower zone consolidation, which peaked at 10\u201312 days from symptom onset. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020",
        "A 27-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department with fever and thoracic pain. In the previous 6 months, the patient lost a substantial amount of weight (12 kg). His family history was negative for cardiac disease. Electrocardiography revealed sinus rhythm, and diffuse T-wave inversion. Two-dimensional echocardiography was performed (Fig 1) and revealed normal left systolic function (ejection fraction, 60%). Laboratory tests showed elevated levels of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (1.07 ng/mL; normal value, <0.015 ng/mL), high levels of C-reactive protein (16 mg/dL; normal range, 0-5 mg/dL), and leukocytosis with an eosinophilia level of 8710/\u03bcL (normal level, <400/\u03bcL). Parasitic and infectious diseases (Toxocara canis, strongyloides, filariasis, cysticercosis, fasciola, trichinella, echinococcosis) were excluded based on blood and fecal test results. Corticosteroid therapy was started, and the patient was dismissed. A few days later, he was readmitted to the emergency department with a headache and suddenly blurred vision. Neurologic and ophthalmologic findings were normal, and MRI of the brain was performed (Fig 2). Cardiac MRI (Fig 3) was performed 2 days later and revealed the following quantitative results: (a) left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVDV) of 165 mL (LVDV/body surface area [BSA], 89 mL/m2; normal range, 64-100 mL/m2), left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVSV) of 80 mL (LVSV/BSA, 43 mL/m2; normal range, 17-39 mL/m2); stroke volume (SV) of 85 mL (SV/BSA, 46 mL/m2; normal range, 43-67 mL/m2); and ejection fraction of 52% and (b) right ventricular end-diastolic volume (RVDV) of 163 mL (RVDV/BSA, 88 mL/m2; normal range, 63-111 mL/m2), right ventricular end-systolic volume (RVSV) of 81 mL (RVSV/BSA, 44 mL/m2; normal range, 32-92 mL/m2); stroke volume (SV) of 82 mL (SV/BSA, 44 mL/m2; normal range, 39-71 mL/m2); and ejection fraction of 50%.",
        "Purpose To evaluate the performance of an artificial intelligence (AI) tool using a deep learning algorithm for detecting hemorrhage, mass effect, or hydrocephalus (HMH) at non-contrast material-enhanced head computed tomographic (CT) examinations and to determine algorithm performance for detection of suspected acute infarct (SAI). Materials and Methods This HIPAA-compliant retrospective study was completed after institutional review board approval. A training and validation dataset of noncontrast-enhanced head CT examinations that comprised 100 examinations of HMH, 22 of SAI, and 124 of noncritical findings was obtained resulting in 2583 representative images. Examinations were processed by using a convolutional neural network (deep learning) using two different window and level configurations (brain window and stroke window). AI algorithm performance was tested on a separate dataset containing 50 examinations with HMH findings, 15 with SAI findings, and 35 with noncritical findings. Results Final algorithm performance for HMH showed 90% (45 of 50) sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI]: 78%, 97%) and 85% (68 of 80) specificity (95% CI: 76%, 92%), with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.91 with the brain window. For SAI, the best performance was achieved with the stroke window showing 62% (13 of 21) sensitivity (95% CI: 38%, 82%) and 96% (27 of 28) specificity (95% CI: 82%, 100%), with AUC of 0.81. Conclusion AI using deep learning demonstrates promise for detecting critical findings at noncontrast-enhanced head CT. A dedicated algorithm was required to detect SAI. Detection of SAI showed lower sensitivity in comparison to detection of HMH, but showed reasonable performance. Findings support further investigation of the algorithm in a controlled and prospective clinical setting to determine whether it can independently screen noncontrast-enhanced head CT examinations and notify the interpreting radiologist of critical findings. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Background Recent deep learning (DL) approaches have shown promise in improving sensitivity but have not addressed limitations in radiologist specificity or efficiency. Purpose To develop a DL model to triage a portion of mammograms as cancer free, improving performance and workflow efficiency. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, 223 109 consecutive screening mammograms performed in 66 661 women from January 2009 to December 2016 were collected with cancer outcomes obtained through linkage to a regional tumor registry. This cohort was split by patient into 212 272, 25 999, and 26 540 mammograms from 56 831, 7021, and 7176 patients for training, validation, and testing, respectively. A DL model was developed to triage mammograms as cancer free and evaluated on the test set. A DL-triage workflow was simulated in which radiologists skipped mammograms triaged as cancer free (interpreting them as negative for cancer) and read mammograms not triaged as cancer free by using the original interpreting radiologists' assessments. Sensitivities, specificities, and percentage of mammograms read were calculated, with and without the DL-triage-simulated workflow. Statistics were computed across 5000 bootstrap samples to assess confidence intervals (CIs). Specificities were compared by using a two-tailed t test (P < .05) and sensitivities were compared by using a one-sided t test with a noninferiority margin of 5% (P < .05). Results The test set included 7176 women (mean age, 57.8 years \u00b1 10.9 [standard deviation]). When reading all mammograms, radiologists obtained a sensitivity and specificity of 90.6% (173 of 191; 95% CI: 86.6%, 94.7%) and 93.5% (24 625 of 26 349; 95% CI: 93.3%, 93.9%). In the DL-simulated workflow, the radiologists obtained a sensitivity and specificity of 90.1% (172 of 191; 95% CI: 86.0%, 94.3%) and 94.2% (24 814 of 26 349; 95% CI: 94.0%, 94.6%) while reading 80.7% (21 420 of 26 540) of the mammograms. The simulated workflow improved specificity (P = .002) and obtained a noninferior sensitivity with a margin of 5% (P < .001). Conclusion This deep learning model has the potential to reduce radiologist workload and significantly improve specificity without harming sensitivity. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Purpose To compare the diagnostic utility of an investigational optoacoustic imaging device that fuses laser optical imaging (OA) with grayscale ultrasonography (US) to grayscale US alone in differentiating benign and malignant breast masses. Materials and Methods This prospective, 16-site study of 2105 women (study period: 12/21/2012 to 9/9/2015) compared Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) categories assigned by seven blinded independent readers to benign and malignant breast masses using OA/US versus US alone. BI-RADS 3, 4, or 5 masses assessed at diagnostic US with biopsy-proven histologic findings and BI-RADS 3 masses stable at 12 months were eligible. Independent readers reviewed US images obtained with the OA/US device, assigned a probability of malignancy (POM) and BI-RADS category, and locked results. The same independent readers then reviewed OA/US images, scored OA features, and assigned OA/US POM and a BI-RADS category. Specificity and sensitivity were calculated for US and OA/US. Benign and malignant mass upgrade and downgrade rates, positive and negative predictive values, and positive and negative likelihood ratios were compared. Results Of 2105 consented subjects with 2191 masses, 100 subjects (103 masses) were analyzed separately as a training population and excluded. An additional 202 subjects (210 masses) were excluded due to technical failures or incomplete imaging, 72 subjects (78 masses) due to protocol deviations, and 41 subjects (43 masses) due to high-risk histologic results. Of 1690 subjects with 1757 masses (1079 [61.4%] benign and 678 [38.6%] malignant masses), OA/US downgraded 40.8% (3078/7535) of benign mass reads, with a specificity of 43.0% (3242/7538, 99% confidence interval [CI]: 40.4%, 45.7%) for OA/US versus 28.1% (2120/7543, 99% CI: 25.8%, 30.5%) for the internal US of the OA/US device. OA/US exceeded US in specificity by 14.9% (P < .0001; 99% CI: 12.9, 16.9%). Sensitivity for biopsied malignant masses was 96.0% (4553/4745, 99% CI: 94.5%, 97.0%) for OA/US and 98.6% (4680/4746, 99% CI: 97.8%, 99.1%) for US (P < .0001). The negative likelihood ratio of 0.094 for OA/US indicates a negative examination can reduce a maximum US-assigned pretest probability of 17.8% (low BI-RADS 4B) to a posttest probability of 2% (BI-RADS 3). Conclusion OA/US increases the specificity of breast mass assessment compared with the device internal grayscale US alone.

        "Background Accurate estimation of the malignancy risk of pulmonary nodules at chest CT is crucial for optimizing management in lung cancer screening. Purpose To develop and validate a deep learning (DL) algorithm for malignancy risk estimation of pulmonary nodules detected at screening CT. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, the DL algorithm was developed with 16 077 nodules (1249 malignant) collected -between 2002 and 2004 from the National Lung Screening Trial. External validation was performed in the following three -cohorts -collected between 2004 and 2010 from the Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial: a full cohort containing all 883 nodules (65 -malignant) and two cancer-enriched cohorts with size matching (175 nodules, 59 malignant) and without size matching (177 -nodules, 59 malignant) of benign nodules selected at random. Algorithm performance was measured by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and compared with that of the Pan-Canadian Early Detection of Lung Cancer (PanCan) model in the full cohort and a group of 11 clinicians composed of four thoracic radiologists, five radiology residents, and two pulmonologists in the cancer-enriched cohorts. Results The DL algorithm significantly outperformed the PanCan model in the full cohort (AUC, 0.93 [95% CI: 0.89, 0.96] vs 0.90 [95% CI: 0.86, 0.93]; P = .046). The algorithm performed comparably to thoracic radiologists in cancer-enriched cohorts with both random benign nodules (AUC, 0.96 [95% CI: 0.93, 0.99] vs 0.90 [95% CI: 0.81, 0.98]; P = .11) and size-matched benign nodules (AUC, 0.86 [95% CI: 0.80, 0.91] vs 0.82 [95% CI: 0.74, 0.89]; P = .26). Conclusion The deep learning algorithm showed excellent performance, comparable to thoracic radiologists, for malignancy risk estimation of pulmonary nodules detected at screening CT. This algorithm has the potential to provide reliable and reproducible malignancy risk scores for clinicians, which may help optimize management in lung cancer screening. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "History A 26-year-old man presented with a 1-month history of chest pain, a palpable and painful right inguinal mass, and edema in the right lower extremity. One month earlier, he started to experience left chest pain with no cough. Pulmonary CT angiography (CTA) revealed a left lower lobe segmental pulmonary embolus. The local hospital made a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE). He received anticoagulants, and his chest pain was gradually relieved. At the time of current presentation, the patient was experiencing right lower extremity swelling and pain. Physical examination revealed a 4 \u00d7 3 cm palpable right inguinal mass with no redness. His medical history and family history were negative. The results of laboratory work-up were normal, with a D-dimer level of 0.16 mg/L fibrinogen equivalent units (reference range, <0.46 mg/L) and an international normalized ratio of 2.45 (therapeutic range, 2.0\u20133.0 for a patient taking warfarin), except the prothrombin time was 28.2 seconds (reference range, 9.6\u201312.8 seconds) and the activated partial thromboplastin time was 52.2 seconds (reference range, 24.8\u201333.8 seconds). Echocardiography, chest radiography, chest CT, and contrast-enhanced CT revealed no abnormalities. The patient underwent right lower extremity vascular conventional US (Philips IU22; Philips) with an L9\u20133 probe (3\u20139 MHz, venous condition) and contrast-enhanced US (1.5\u20132.0 mL, SonoVue; Bracco) with an intravenous bolus injection at the initial evaluation.

        "Intracranial vessel wall magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has gained much attention in the past decade and has become part of state-of-the-art MR imaging protocols to assist in diagnosing the cause of ischemic stroke. With intracranial vessel wall imaging, vessel wall characteristics have tentatively been described for atherosclerosis, vasculitis, dissections, Moyamoya disease, and aneurysms. With the increasing demand and subsequently increased use of intracranial vessel wall imaging in clinical practice, radiologists should be aware of the choices in imaging parameters and how they affect image quality, the clinical indications, methods of assessment, and limitations in the interpretation of these images. In this How I do It article, the authors will discuss the technical requirements and considerations for vessel wall image acquisition in general, describe their own vessel wall imaging protocol at 3 T and 7 T, show a step-by-step basic assessment of intracranial vessel wall imaging as performed at their institution\u2013including commonly encountered artifacts and pitfalls\u2013and summarize the commonly reported imaging characteristics of various intracranial vessel wall diseases for direct clinical applicability. Finally, future technical and clinical considerations for full implementation of intracranial vessel wall imaging in clinical practice, including the need for histologic validation and acquisition time reduction, will be discussed.",
        "History A 70-year-old man had a posterior left thigh lesion confirmed to be biopsy-proven melanoma. The patient underwent wide excision and sentinel node biopsy, which showed absence of residual melanoma. Two years later, the patient noticed a subcentimeter subcutaneous lump in his thigh. Repeat excisional biopsy showed involvement of the surrounding soft tissue, consistent with a satellite lesion. Follow-up combined PET/CT revealed satellite nodules around the primary lesion, enabling confirmation of subcutaneous metastatic disease. The patient was subsequently started on nivolumab, an anti\u2013programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor that blocks PD-1 and is approved as a first-line treatment in patients with advanced metastatic melanoma. On the baseline scan prior to starting nivolumab, there were no CT findings that suggested metastatic disease, nor were there enlarged mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes. Five months after initiation of nivolumab treatment, the first follow-up chest CT scan was performed and showed new findings in the mediastinum and bilateral lungs. The patient remained asymptomatic during the treatment period. Furthermore, the subcutaneous metastatic disease remained stable during the treatment period, and no other site of metastatic disease was noted on follow-up CT scans obtained during the first 5 months of treatment. The patient had no prior history of infectious or occupational exposures. During the nivolumab treatment cycle, his pertinent laboratory values and physical examination findings were unremarkable.",
        "Purpose To compare different methods for generating features from radiology reports and to develop a method to automatically identify findings in these reports. Materials and Methods In this study, 96 303 head computed tomography (CT) reports were obtained. The linguistic complexity of these reports was compared with that of alternative corpora. Head CT reports were preprocessed, and machine-analyzable features were constructed by using bag-of-words (BOW), word embedding, and Latent Dirichlet allocation-based approaches. Ultimately, 1004 head CT reports were manually labeled for findings of interest by physicians, and a subset of these were deemed critical findings. Lasso logistic regression was used to train models for physician-assigned labels on 602 of 1004 head CT reports (60%) using the constructed features, and the performance of these models was validated on a held-out 402 of 1004 reports (40%). Models were scored by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and aggregate AUC statistics were reported for (a) all labels, (b) critical labels, and (c) the presence of any critical finding in a report. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and F1 score were reported for the best performing model's (a) predictions of all labels and (b) identification of reports containing critical findings. Results The best-performing model (BOW with unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams plus average word embeddings vector) had a held-out AUC of 0.966 for identifying the presence of any critical head CT finding and an average 0.957 AUC across all head CT findings. Sensitivity and specificity for identifying the presence of any critical finding were 92.59% (175 of 189) and 89.67% (191 of 213), respectively. Average sensitivity and specificity across all findings were 90.25% (1898 of 2103) and 91.72% (18 351 of 20 007), respectively. Simpler BOW methods achieved results competitive with those of more sophisticated approaches, with an average AUC for presence of any critical finding of 0.951 for unigram BOW versus 0.966 for the best-performing model. The Yule I of the head CT corpus was 34, markedly lower than that of the Reuters corpus (at 103) or I2B2 discharge summaries (at 271), indicating lower linguistic complexity. Conclusion Automated methods can be used to identify findings in radiology reports. The success of this approach benefits from the standardized language of these reports. With this method, a large labeled corpus can be generated for applications such as deep learning. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Background Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is an established method used to detect and localize focal interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs). Current MEG systems house hundreds of cryogenic sensors in a rigid, one-size-fits-all helmet, which results in several limitations, particularly in children. Purpose To determine if on-scalp MEG based on optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) alleviates the main limitations of cryogenic MEG. Materials and Methods In this prospective single-center study conducted in a tertiary university teaching hospital, participants underwent cryogenic (102 magnetometers, 204 planar gradiometers) and on-scalp (32 OPMs) MEG. The two modalities for the detection and localization of IEDs were compared. The t test was used to compare IED amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Distributed source modeling was performed on OPM-based and cryogenic MEG data. Results Five children (median age, 9.4 years [range, 5\u201311 years]; four girls) with self-limited idiopathic (n = 3) or refractory (n = 2) focal epilepsy were included. IEDs were identified in all five children with comparable sensor topographies for both MEG devices. IED amplitudes were 2.3 (7.2 of 3.1) to 4.6 (3.2 of 0.7) times higher (P < .001) with on-scalp MEG, and the SNR was 27% (16.7 of 13.2) to 60% (12.8 of 8.0) higher (P value range: .001\u2013.009) with on-scalp MEG in all but one participant (P = .93), whose head movements created pronounced motion artifacts. The neural source of averaged IEDs was located at approximately 5 mm (n = 3) or higher (8.3 mm, n = 1; 15.6 mm, n = 1) between on-scalp and cryogenic MEG. Conclusion Despite the limited number of sensors and scalp coverage, on-scalp magnetoencephalography (MEG) based on optically pumped magnetometers helped detect interictal epileptiform discharges in school-aged children with epilepsy with a higher amplitude, higher signal-to-noise ratio, and similar localization value compared with conventional cryogenic MEG.

        "History A 46-year-old woman with known mixed connective tissue disease with clinical features of scleroderma and polymyositis and who was not on specific medications was referred to our institution to assess for interstitial lung disease due to her predisposing condition. She was a nonsmoker, had no respiratory symptoms, and enjoyed good exercise tolerance. She did not have any cutaneous lesions or renal disease. There was no family history of pulmonary or systemic disease. Her routine blood test results revealed a white blood cell count of 4.6 \u00d7 109/L (normal range, [4.4\u201310.1] \u00d7 109/L), a hemoglobin level of 7.76 mmol/L (normal range, 7.26\u20139.18 mmol/L), a platelet count of 189 \u00d7 109/L (normal range, [170\u2013380] \u00d7 109/L), a bilirubin level of 8 \u03bcmol/L (7\u201319 \u03bcmol/L), and a creatinine level of 63 \u03bcmol/L (45\u201382 \u03bcmol/L), all within normal limits. Lung function tests at presentation yielded normal results, with a diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide of 95% and a forced vital capacity of 2.29 (98% predicted value). However, this patient had an elevated serum globulin level of 47 g/L (normal range, 26\u201332 g/L) and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 36 mm/h (normal range, 0\u201320 mm/h), while C-reactive protein level was normal at less than 0.35 mg/dL. She was seropositive for antinuclear (titer >1/720), anti-Ro, anti-La, and anti-extractable nuclear antigen antibodies. Chest radiography and CT were performed at presentation (Figs 1, 2) and 14-year follow-up (Figs 3, 4). PET/CT was performed at 7- (Fig 5, A and B) and 13-year follow-up (Fig 5, C and D). Throughout this 14-year follow-up period, she remained completely free of respiratory symptoms and continued to go for a brisk walk every day. At 14-year follow-up, there was no substantial change in serum laboratory values, but a lung function test revealed her diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide had decreased to 52%, while her forced vital capacity remained good at 95%; these findings were suggestive of interval development of restrictive lung function.",
        "History A 31-year-old woman with a history of bilateral orthotopic lung transplantation performed 10 months earlier for cystic fibrosis presented for a routine follow-up appointment, with her chief symptom being a cough. The cough started approximately 1 month prior to this appointment and was minimally productive of clear to yellow phlegm. In addition to her cough, she reported increased sinus congestion and a sensation of \u201csomething in her upper chest.\u201d She denied shortness of breath, wheezing, hemoptysis, or cigarette smoking. Review of systems was negative for fever, chills, or night sweats. At physical examination, the patient was afebrile, borderline tachycardic (heart rate, 99 beats per minute), and mildly hypertensive (blood pressure, 138/99 mm Hg). Oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. Laboratory evaluation revealed a white blood cell count of 3.5 \u00d7 109/L (normal range, 3.2\u20139.8 \u00d7 109/L). Pulmonary function testing was notable for a newly decreased ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) to forced vital capacity (FVC) of 64% (2.0 and 3.4 L, respectively) (normal FEV1-to-FVC ratio, 80%), suggesting an obstructive lung process. One month prior to presentation, the patient\u2019s sputum cultures grew Pseudomonas and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The patient showed no evidence of active infection at the time of bronchoscopy. Thus, the bacteria were favored to reflect colonization, and antibiotic therapy was not administered at that time.

Oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. Laboratory evaluation revealed a white blood cell count of 3.5 \u00d7 109/L (normal range, [3.2\u20139.8] \u00d7 109/L). Pulmonary function testing was notable for a newly decreased ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) to forced vital capacity (FVC) of 64% (2.0 and 3.4 L, respectively) (normal FEV1-to-FVC ratio, 80%), suggesting an obstructive lung process. One month prior to presentation, the patient\u2019s sputum cultures grew Pseudomonas and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The patient showed no evidence of active infection at the time of bronchoscopy. Thus, the bacteria were favored to reflect colonization, and antibiotic therapy was not administered at that time. The patient was taking an immunosuppression regimen of mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept; Genentech, San Francisco, Calif) (1 g twice daily), prednisone (10 mg daily), and tacrolimus (Prograf; Astellas Pharma US, Northbrook, Ill) (goal therapeutic range, 12\u201314 ng/mL). The patient was sent for posteroanterior and lateral chest radiography followed by chest CT (Figs 1\u20133) and fluorine 18 (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT (Fig 4).",
        "Background Neurological complications in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been described, but the understanding of their pathophysiology and neuroanatomical correlates remains limited. Purpose To report on the frequency and type of neuroradiological findings in COVID-19. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, all consecutive adult hospitalized patients with PCR-positivity for SARS-CoV-2, undergoing neuroimaging at Karolinska University Hospital between March 2 and May 24, 2020, were included. All examinations were systematically re-evaluated by 12 readers. Summary descriptive statistics were calculated. Results 185 patients with COVID-19 (62\u00b114 years, 138 men) underwent neuroimaging. In total, 222 brain CT, 47 brain MRI and 7 spinal MRI scans were performed. Intra-axial susceptibility abnormalities were the most common finding (29 of 39 [74%, 95%-CI 58-87%]) in patients with brain MRI, often with an ovoid shape suggestive of microvascular pathology, and with a predilection to corpus callosum (23 of 39, [59%, 95%-CI 42-74%]) and juxtacortical areas (14 of 39, [36%, 95% CI 21-53%]). Ischemic and macrohemorrhagic manifestations were also seen, but vascular imaging did not reveal overt abnormalities. Dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion MRI in 19 patients did not reveal consistent asymmetries between hemispheres or regions. Many patients (18 of 41 [44%, 95%-CI 28-60%]) had leukoencephalopathy and one patient had a cytotoxic lesion of the corpus callosum. Other findings included olfactory bulb signal abnormalities (7 of 37, 19%), prominent optic nerve subarachnoid spaces (20 of 36, 56%), and enhancement of the parenchyma (3 of 20, 15%), leptomeninges (3 of 20, 15%), cranial nerves (2 of 20, 10%), and spinal nerves (2 of 4, 50%). At MRI follow-up, regression of leukoencephalopathy and progressive leptomeningeal enhancement was observed in one patient respectively, suggestive of dynamic processes. Conclusion Patients with COVID-19 had a wide spectrum of vascular and inflammatory involvement of both the central and peripheral nervous system.",
        "BackgroundThe performance of a deep learning (DL) algorithm should be validated in actual clinical situations, before its clinical implementation.PurposeTo evaluate the performance of a DL algorithm for identifying chest radiographs with clinically relevant abnormalities in the emergency department (ED) setting.Materials and MethodsThis single-center retrospective study included consecutive patients who visited the ED and underwent initial chest radiography between January 1 and March 31, 2017. Chest radiographs were analyzed with a commercially available DL algorithm. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated by determining the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity at predefined operating cutoffs (high-sensitivity and high-specificity cutoffs). The sensitivities and specificities of the algorithm were compared with those of the on-call radiology residents who interpreted the chest radiographs in the actual practice by using McNemar tests. If there were discordant findings between the algorithm and resident, the residents reinterpreted the chest radiographs by using the algorithm's output.ResultsA total of 1135 patients (mean age, 53 years \u00b1 18; 582 men) were evaluated. In the identification of abnormal chest radiographs, the algorithm showed an AUC of 0.95 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.93, 0.96), a sensitivity of 88.7% (227 of 256 radiographs; 95% CI: 84.1%, 92.3%), and a specificity of 69.6% (612 of 879 radiographs; 95% CI: 66.5%, 72.7%) at the high-sensitivity cutoff and a sensitivity of 81.6% (209 of 256 radiographs; 95% CI: 76.3%, 86.2%) and specificity of 90.3% (794 of 879 radiographs; 95% CI: 88.2%, 92.2%) at the high-specificity cutoff. Radiology residents showed lower sensitivity (65.6% [168 of 256 radiographs; 95% CI: 59.5%, 71.4%], P < .001) and higher specificity (98.1% [862 of 879 radiographs; 95% CI: 96.9%, 98.9%], P < .001) compared with the algorithm. After reinterpretation of chest radiographs with use of the algorithm's outputs, the sensitivity of the residents improved (73.4% [188 of 256 radiographs; 95% CI: 68.0%, 78.8%], P = .003), whereas specificity was reduced (94.3% [829 of 879 radiographs; 95% CI: 92.8%, 95.8%], P < .001).ConclusionA deep learning algorithm used with emergency department chest radiographs showed diagnostic performance for identifying clinically relevant abnormalities and helped improve the sensitivity of radiology residents' evaluation.Published under a CC BY 4.0 license.Online supplemental material is available for this article.See also the editorial by Munera and Infante in this issue.",
        "Purpose To analyze the frequency and distribution of low-signal-intensity regions (LSIRs) in lymphoma lesions and to compare these to fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake and biologic markers of inflammation. Materials and Methods The authors analyzed 61 untreated patients with a bulky lymphoma (at least one tumor mass \u22657 cm in diameter). When a LSIR within tumor lesions was detected on diffusion-weighted images obtained with a b value of 50 sec/mm2, a T2-weighted gradient-echo (GRE) sequence was performed and calcifications were searched for with computed tomography (CT). In two patients, Perls staining was performed on tissue samples from the LSIR. LSIRs were compared with biologic inflammatory parameters and baseline FDG positon emission tomography (PET)/CT parameters (maximum standardized uptake value [SUVmax], total metabolic tumor volume [TMTV]). Results LSIRs were detected in 22 patients and corresponded to signal void on GRE images; one LSIR was due to calcifications, and three LSIRS were due to a recent biopsy. In 18 patients, LSIRs appeared to be related to focal iron deposits; this was proven with Perls staining in two patients. The LSIRs presumed to be due to iron deposits were found mostly in patients with aggressive lymphoma (nine of 26 patients with Hodgkin lymphoma and eight of 20 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma vs one of 15 patients with follicular lymphoma; P = .047) and with advanced stage disease (15 of 18 patients). LSIRS were observed in spleen (n = 14), liver (n = 3), and nodal (n = 8) lesions and corresponded to foci FDG uptake, with mean SUVmax of 9.8, 6.7, and 16.2, respectively. These patients had significantly higher serum levels of C-reactive protein, \u03b11-globulin, and \u03b12-globulin and more frequently had microcytic anemia than those without such deposits (P = .0072, P = .003, P = .0068, and P < .0001, respectively). They also had a significantly higher TMTV (P = .0055) and higher levels of spleen involvement (P < .0001). Conclusion LSIRs due to focal iron deposits are detected in lymphoma lesions and are associated with a more pronounced biologic inflammatory syndrome. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To determine whether quantitative MRI relaxation time mapping techniques can help to detect ischemic injury to the developing femoral head. Materials and Methods For this prospective animal study conducted from November 2015 to February 2018, 10 male 6-week-old piglets underwent an operation to induce complete right femoral head ischemia. Animals were humanely killed at 48 hours (n = 2) or 4 weeks (n = 8) after the operation, and the operated and contralateral-control femoral heads were harvested and frozen. Thawed specimens were imaged at 9.4-T MRI by using T1, T2, T1 in the rotating frame (T1\u03c1), adiabatic T1\u03c1, relaxation along a fictitious field (RAFF), and T2* mapping and evaluated with histologic analysis. Paired relaxation time differences between the operated and control femoral heads were measured in the secondary ossification center (SOC), epiphyseal cartilage, articular cartilage, and metaphysis and were analyzed by using a paired t test. Results In the SOC, T1\u03c1 and RAFF had the greatest percent increases in the operated versus control femoral heads at both 48 hours (112% and 72%, respectively) and 4 weeks (74% and 70%, respectively). In the epiphyseal and articular cartilage, T2, T1\u03c1, and RAFF were similarly increased at both points (range, 24%-49%). At 4 weeks, T2, T1\u03c1, adiabatic T1\u03c1, and RAFF were increased in the SOC (P = .004, .018, < .001, and .001, respectively), epiphyseal cartilage (P = .009, .008, .011, and .007, respectively), and articular cartilage (P = .005, .016, .033, and .018, respectively). Histologic assessment identified necrosis in SOC and deep layer of the epiphyseal cartilage at both points. Conclusion T2, T1 in the rotating frame, adiabatic T1 in the rotating frame, and relaxation along a fictitious field maps are sensitive in helping to detect ischemic injury to the developing femoral head. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Imaging research laboratories are rapidly creating machine learning systems that achieve expert human performance using open-source methods and tools. These artificial intelligence systems are being developed to improve medical image reconstruction, noise reduction, quality assurance, triage, segmentation, computer-aided detection, computer-aided classification, and radiogenomics. In August 2018, a meeting was held in Bethesda, Maryland, at the National Institutes of Health to discuss the current state of the art and knowledge gaps and to develop a roadmap for future research initiatives. Key research priorities include: 1, new image reconstruction methods that efficiently produce images suitable for human interpretation from source data; 2, automated image labeling and annotation methods, including information extraction from the imaging report, electronic phenotyping, and prospective structured image reporting; 3, new machine learning methods for clinical imaging data, such as tailored, pretrained model architectures, and federated machine learning methods; 4, machine learning methods that can explain the advice they provide to human users (so-called explainable artificial intelligence); and 5, validated methods for image de-identification and data sharing to facilitate wide availability of clinical imaging data sets. This research roadmap is intended to identify and prioritize these needs for academic research laboratories, funding agencies, professional societies, and industry.",
        "Background In 2017, the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) included an algorithm for the assessment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with local-regional therapy. The aim of the algorithm was to enable standardized evaluation of treatment response to guide subsequent therapy. However, the performance of the algorithm has not yet been validated in the literature. Purpose To evaluate the performance of the LI-RADS 2017 Treatment Response algorithm for assessing the histopathologic viability of HCC treated with bland arterial embolization. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included patients who underwent bland arterial embolization for HCC between 2006 and 2016 and subsequent liver transplantation. Three radiologists independently assessed all treated lesions by using the CT/MRI LI-RADS 2017 Treatment Response algorithm. Radiology and posttransplant histopathology reports were then compared. Lesions were categorized on the basis of explant pathologic findings as either completely (100%) or incompletely (<100%) necrotic, and performance characteristics and predictive values for the LI-RADS Treatment Response (LR-TR) Viable and Nonviable categories were calculated for each reader. Interreader association was calculated by using the Fleiss \u03ba. Results A total of 45 adults (mean age, 57.1 years \u00b1 8.2; 13 women) with 63 total lesions were included. For predicting incomplete histopathologic tumor necrosis, the accuracy of the LR-TR Viable category for the three readers was 60%-65%, and the positive predictive value was 86%-96%. For predicting complete histopathologic tumor necrosis, the accuracy of the LR-TR Nonviable category was 67%-71%, and the negative predictive value was 81%-87%. By consensus, 17 (27%) of 63 lesions were categorized as LR-TR Equivocal, and 12 of these lesions were incompletely necrotic. Interreader association for the LR-TR category was moderate (\u03ba = 0.55; 95% confidence interval: 0.47, 0.67). Conclusion The Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System 2017 Treatment Response algorithm had high predictive value and moderate interreader association for the histopathologic viability of hepatocellular carcinoma treated with bland arterial embolization when lesions were assessed as Viable or Nonviable. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019",
        "History A 1-year-old boy was referred for cochlear implant assessment after he received a diagnosis of bilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss at neonatal hearing screening shortly after birth. The child was born at term via uneventful delivery, and there was no history of familial hearing loss or maternal illness. Tympanic membranes were normal, and hearing loss was confirmed with auditory brainstem testing, which showed no response from either ear. Hearing aids were provided from 3 months of age, but no behavioral responses were noted when these were worn. He was also noted to have some mild developmental delay throughout his 1st year of life and was slow to crawl, roll over, and stand up. Physical examination showed no syndromic features or physical abnormalities. Ophthalmology confirmed normal vision and visual movements but bilateral anesthetic corneas. He had corneal abrasions due to minor repeated corneal trauma, and left-sided tarsorraphy was performed at 6 months. Facial nerve function, swallow, and voice quality were normal. To assess suitability for a cochlear implant, the patient underwent MRI of the temporal lobe and brain ( Figs 1 - 4 ) and thin-section CT of the temporal bones ( Figs 5 , 6 ). The patient subsequently underwent left cochlear implantation. Figure 1: Sagittal midline T1-weighted 1.5-T MR image (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 541/15).
