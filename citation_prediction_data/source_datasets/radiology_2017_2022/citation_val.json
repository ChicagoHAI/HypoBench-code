Radiomics analysis at preoperative MRI holds potential to identify high-risk phenotypes. Purpose To evaluate the performance of multiparametric MRI three-dimensional radiomics-based machine learning models for differentiating low- from high-risk histopathologic markers\u2014deep myometrial invasion (MI), lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), and high-grade status\u2014and advanced-stage endometrial carcinoma. Materials and Methods This dual-center retrospective study included women with histologically proven endometrial carcinoma who underwent 1.5-T MRI before hysterectomy between January 2011 and July 2015. Exclusion criteria were tumor diameter less than 1 cm, missing MRI sequences or histopathology reports, neoadjuvant therapy, and malignant neoplasms other than endometrial carcinoma. Three-dimensional radiomics features were extracted after tumor segmentation at MRI (T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI). Predictive features were selected in the training set with use of random forest (RF) models for each end point, and trained RF models were applied to the external test set. Five board-certified radiologists conducted MRI-based staging and deep MI assessment in the training set. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) were reported with balanced accuracies, and radiologists' readings were compared with radiomics with use of McNemar tests. Results In total, 157 women were included: 94 at the first institution (training set; mean age, 66 years \u00b1 11 [SD]) and 63 at the second institution (test set; 67 years \u00b1 12). RF models dichotomizing deep MI, LVSI, high grade, and International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage led to AUCs of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.68, 0.88), 0.80 (95% CI: 0.67, 0.93), 0.74 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.86), and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.92), respectively, in the test set. In the training set, radiomics provided increased performance compared with radiologists' readings for identifying deep MI (balanced accuracy, 86% vs 79%; P = .03), while no evidence of a difference was observed in performance for advanced FIGO stage (80% vs 78%; P = .27). Conclusion Three-dimensional radiomics can stratify patients by using preoperative MRI according to high-risk histopathologic end points in endometrial carcinoma and provide nonsignificantly different or higher performance than radiologists in identifying advanced stage and deep myometrial invasion, respectively. \u00a9 RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

Purpose To compare the performance of radiologists in detecting malignant pulmonary nodules on chest radiographs when assisted by deep learning\u2013based DCNN software with that of radiologists or DCNN software alone in a multicenter setting. Materials and Methods Investigators at four medical centers retrospectively identified 600 lung cancer\u2013containing chest radiographs and 200 normal chest radiographs. Each radiograph with a lung cancer had at least one malignant nodule confirmed by CT and pathologic examination. Twelve radiologists from the four centers independently analyzed the chest radiographs and marked regions of interest. Commercially available deep learning\u2013based computer-aided detection software separately trained, tested, and validated with 19 330 radiographs was used to find suspicious nodules. The radiologists then reviewed the images with the assistance of DCNN software. The sensitivity and number of false-positive findings per image of DCNN software, radiologists alone, and radiologists with the use of DCNN software were analyzed by using logistic regression and Poisson regression. Results The average sensitivity of radiologists improved (from 65.1% [1375 of 2112; 95% confidence interval {CI}: 62.0%, 68.1%] to 70.3% [1484 of 2112; 95% CI: 67.2%, 73.1%], P < .001) and the number of false-positive findings per radiograph declined (from 0.2 [488 of 2400; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.22] to 0.18 [422 of 2400; 95% CI: 0.16, 0.2], P < .001) when the radiologists re-reviewed radiographs with the DCNN software. For the 12 radiologists in this study, 104 of 2400 radiographs were positively changed (from false-negative to true-positive or from false-positive to true-negative) using the DCNN, while 56 of 2400 radiographs were changed negatively. Conclusion Radiologists had better performance with deep convolutional network software for the detection of malignant pulmonary nodules on chest radiographs than without. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, eight radiologists with 3-32 years experience in thyroid ultrasonography (US) reviewed US features of 100 thyroid nodules that were cytologically proven, pathologically proven, or both in December 2016. The radiologists evaluated nodule features in five US categories and provided biopsy recommendations based on their own practice patterns without knowledge of ACR TI-RADS criteria. Another three expert radiologists served as the reference standard readers for the imaging findings. ACR TI-RADS criteria were retrospectively applied to the features assigned by the eight radiologists to produce biopsy recommendations. Comparison was made for biopsy rate, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Results Fifteen of the 100 nodules (15%) were malignant. The mean number of nodules recommended for biopsy by the eight radiologists was 80 \u00b1 16 (standard deviation) (range, 38-95 nodules) based on their own practice patterns and 57 \u00b1 11 (range, 37-73 nodules) with retrospective application of ACR TI-RADS criteria. Without ACR TI-RADS criteria, readers had an overall sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 95% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 83%, 99%), 20% (95% CI: 16%, 25%), and 28% (95% CI: 21%, 37%), respectively. After applying ACR TI-RADS criteria, overall sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 92% (95% CI: 68%, 98%), 44% (95% CI: 33%, 56%), and 52% (95% CI: 40%, 63%), respectively. Although fewer malignancies were recommended for biopsy with ACR TI-RADS criteria, the majority met the criteria for follow-up US, with only three of 120 (2.5%) malignancy encounters requiring no follow-up or biopsy. Expert consensus recommended biopsy in 55 of 100 nodules with ACR TI-RADS criteria. Their sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 87% (95% CI: 48%, 98%), 51% (95% CI: 40%, 62%), and 56% (95% CI: 46%, 66%), respectively. Conclusion ACR TI-RADS criteria offer a meaningful reduction in the number of thyroid nodules recommended for biopsy and significantly improve the accuracy of recommendations for nodule management. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.", "History A 50-year-old woman presented to the emergency department of our hospital with a 2-day history of lower limb pain associated with unusual asthenia and diffuse arthralgia over the past 3 weeks. She was a native of Guinea and had lived in France for most of her life, working as a personal care assistant. Her only medical history of note was an occurrence of fetal death at 12 weeks gestation when she was 35 years old. She had bilateral lower limb swelling, without changes in skin temperature or color. All proximal and distal arterial pulses were felt. General physical examination findings were otherwise unremarkable. Her laboratory tests showed a decreased hemoglobin concentration of 8.9 g/dL (normal range, 12\u201316 g/dL), a decreased platelet count of 45 \u00d7 109/L (normal range, [150\u2013400] \u00d7 109/L), a C-reactive protein level of 158 mg/L (normal range, <5 mg/L), and a d-dimer level of 2000 mg/L (normal range, <500 mg/L]). Compression US of the lower limbs revealed bilateral calf vein thrombosis involving the fibular and posterior tibial veins. Curative anticoagulation using low-molecular-weight heparin (enoxaparin, subcutaneous injection of 100 units per kilogram of body weight twice a day) was started. The day after the start of anticoagulation therapy, the patient reported dyspnea and acute chest and abdominal pain. Her vital signs were assessed, and she had elevated blood pressure and increased heart rate and respiratory rate, but she remained afebrile. Her cardiac auscultation was unremarkable, besides tachycardia. Skin examination revealed small areas of necrosis on the fingertips of her right hand. Laboratory studies were repeated and showed an increase in serum creatinine level from a baseline value of 0.49 mg/dL to a new value of 1.01 mg/dL (normal range, 0.6\u20131.1 mg/dL), an apparition of low-grade proteinuria of 0.43 g per day (normal range, <0.3 g/ day), and a high serum troponin level of 1066 ng/L (normal range, <14 ng/L), whereas electrocardiography showed no ST segment modification and echocardiography revealed a moderately altered left ventricular ejection fraction (45%). There was no coronary occlusion seen at emergency coronarography. Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed (Figs 1, 2) together with cardiac MRI (Figs 3, 4).", "Background The Vesical Imaging-Reporting and Data System (VI-RADS) scoring system was created in 2018 to standardize imaging and reporting of bladder cancer staging with multiparametric MRI. The system provides a five-point VI-RADS score, which suggests the likelihood of detrusor muscle invasion. Muscle-invasive disease carries a worse prognosis and requires radical surgery. Purpose To determine the performance of the VI-RADS score in detecting muscle-invasive bladder cancer in a cohort of patients undergoing multiparametric MRI before surgery. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, a total of 340 patients with bladder cancer were identified from a database of consecutive patients undergoing multiparametric MRI from November 2011 to August 2018. The tumor with the largest burden was selected in those patients with multifocal tumors. Bladder tumors were retrospectively categorized according to the VI-RADS five-point scoring system by two readers, independently and in consensus, who were blinded to histologic findings. The VI-RADS score was compared with postoperative pathology for each tumor, and the performance of VI-RADS for determining detrusor muscle invasion was analyzed by using the Cochran-Armitage test. Results Among the 340 patients, there were 296 men and 44 women; the median age was 64.0 years (interquartile range [IQR], 57.0\u201387.0 years). Of 340 tumors, 255 (75.0%) were verified as non\u2013muscle-invasive and 85 (25.0%) as muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Both the VI-RADS score and its components were associated with muscle-invasive condition (P < .001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for VI-RADS for muscle invasion was 0.94 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.90, 0.98). The sensitivity and specificity of a VI-RADS score of 3 or greater were 87.1% (95% CI: 78%, 93%) and 96.5% (95% CI: 93%, 98%), respectively. Conclusion The Vesical Imaging-Reporting and Data System score effectively defines the likelihood of detrusor muscle invasion in bladder cancer and should be considered for evaluation of tumors prior to surgery. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

Consecutive attendance patterns may further refine estimates. Purpose To estimate the effect of participation in successive mammographic screening examinations on breast cancer mortality. Materials and Methods Participation data for Swedish women eligible for screening mammography in nine counties from 1992 to 2016 were linked with data from registries and regional cancer centers for breast cancer diagnosis, cause, and date of death (Uppsala University ethics committee registration number: 2017/147). Incidence-based breast cancer mortality was calculated by whether the women had participated in the most recent screening examination prior to diagnosis only (intermittent participants), the penultimate screening examination only (lapsed participants), both examinations (serial participants), or neither examination (serial nonparticipants). Rates were analyzed with Poisson regression. We also analyzed incidence of breast cancers proving fatal within 10 years. Results Data were available for a total average population of 549 091 women (average age, 58.9 years \u00b1 6.7 [standard deviation]). The numbers of participants in the four groups were as follows: serial participants, 392 135; intermittent participants, 41 746; lapsed participants, 30 945; and serial nonparticipants, 84 265. Serial participants had a 49% lower risk of breast cancer mortality (relative risk [RR], 0.51; 95% CI: 0.48, 0.55; P < .001) and a 50% lower risk of death from breast cancer within 10 years of diagnosis (RR, 0.50; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.55; P < .001) than serial nonparticipants. Lapsed and intermittent participants had a smaller reduction. Serial participants had significantly lower risk of both outcomes than lapsed or intermittent participants. Analyses correcting for potential biases made little difference to the results. Conclusion Women participating in the last two breast cancer screening examinations prior to breast cancer diagnosis had the largest reduction in breast cancer death. Missing either one of the last two examinations conferred a significantly higher risk. Published under a CC BY 4.0 license. Online supplemental material is available for this article.

Materials and Methods Forty-eight patients with resectable liver tumors underwent preoperative 18F fluorocholine PET/CT. Mean liver standardized uptake value (SUVmean) measurements were obtained from PET images, while histologic indexes of inflammation and fibrosis were applied to nontumor liver tissue from resection specimens. Effects of histopathologic features on liver SUVmean were examined with analysis of variance. Results Liver SUVmean ranged from 4.3 to 11.6, correlating significantly with Knodell histologic activity index (\u03c1 = -0.81, P < .001) and several clinical indexes of liver disease severity. Liver SUVmean also differed significantly across groups stratified by necroinflammatory severity and Metavir fibrosis stage (P < . 001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for 18F fluorocholine PET/CT detecting Metavir fibrosis stage F1 or higher was 0.89 \u00b1 0.05, with an odds-ratio of 3.03 (95% confidence interval: 1.59, 5.88) and sensitivity and specificity of 82% and 93%, respectively. Conclusion Correlations found in patients undergoing hepatic resection for liver cancer between liver 18F fluorocholine uptake and histopathologic indexes of liver fibrosis and inflammation support the use of 18F fluorocholine PET/CT as a potential imaging biomarker for chronic liver disease. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018.", "History A 59-year-old man presented to the gastroenterology outpatient department with acute abdominal pain centered in the epigastrium. He had experienced similar episodes of abdominal pain in the past that had been treated with surgery. He reported multiple failed attempts at upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.

Purpose To investigate the associations between obesity and brain structure (overall and regional brain volumes, and white matter microstructure) assessed at MRI in a sample of the general population. Materials and Methods Between March 2014 and January 2018, 12 087 participants (52.8% women [6381 of 12 087]; mean age, 62 years; age range, 45\u201376 years) in the prospective observational UK Biobank study underwent 3.0-T multiparametric (ie, three-dimensional T1-weighted diffusion tensor imaging [DTI]) brain imaging. Percentage of total body fat (TBF) was assessed by body impedance. Volumetric measures included brain volume, gray matter volume, white matter volume, volumes of subcortical gray matter structures, and regional cortical volumes. Global and tract-specific microstructure was assessed by fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) by using DTI. Linear regression was performed by using TBF as determinant and brain measures as outcome variables, and effect estimates were expressed as standardized \u03b2 values. Results Mean body mass index was 26.6 kg/m2 \u00b1 4.4 (standard deviation [SD]), mean TBF in men was 24.4% \u00b1 5.5, and mean TBF in women was 35.5% \u00b1 6.5. In men, TBF was negatively associated with all subcortical gray matter volumes (thalamus, caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens) other than amygdala volume. In women, TBF was solely negatively associated with globus pallidus volume. In women and men, TBF was positively associated with global FA (women vs men, 0.05 vs 0.07 SD change in global FA per SD change in TBF; P < .001). TBF was negatively associated with global MD in women (\u22120.07 SD change in global MD per SD change in TBF; P < .001). Conclusion These findings provide evidence that obesity is associated with smaller subcortical gray matter volumes. In addition, obesity was associated with higher coherence but lower magnitude of white matter microstructure, which suggests differential influences of obesity on the geometric organization of white matter microstructure. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

Purpose To assess chest CT manifestations of COVID-19 up to 1 year after symptom onset. Materials and Methods Patients were enrolled if they were admitted to the hospital because of COVID-19 and underwent CT during hospitalization at two isolation centers between January 27, 2020, and March 31, 2020. In a prospective study, three serial chest CT scans were obtained at approximately 3, 7, and 12 months after symptom onset and were longitudinally analyzed. The total CT score of pulmonary lobe involvement, ranging from 0 to 25, was assessed (score of 1\u20135 for each lobe). Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to explore independent risk factors for residual CT abnormalities after 1 year. Results A total of 209 study participants (mean age, 49 years \u00b1 13 [standard deviation]; 116 women) were evaluated. CT abnormalities had resolved in 61% of participants (128 of 209) at 3 months and in 75% of participants (156 of 209) at 12 months. Among participants with chest CT abnormalities that had not resolved, there were residual linear opacities in 25 of the 209 participants (12%) and multifocal reticular or cystic lesions in 28 of the 209 participants (13%). Age 50 years or older, lymphopenia, and severe or aggravation of acute respiratory distress syndrome were independent risk factors for residual CT abnormalities at 1 year (odds ratios = 15.9, 18.9, and 43.9, respectively; P < .001 for each comparison). In 53 participants with residual CT abnormalities at 12 months, reticular lesions (41 of 53 participants [77%]) and bronchial dilation (39 of 53 participants [74%]) were observed at discharge and were persistent in 28 (53%) and 24 (45%) of the 53 participants, respectively. Conclusion One year after COVID-19 diagnosis, chest CT scans showed abnormal findings in 53 of the 209 study participants (25%), with 28 of the 209 participants (13%) showing subpleural reticular or cystic lesions. Older participants with severe COVID-19 or acute respiratory distress syndrome were more likely to develop lung sequelae that persisted at 1 year. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

Materials and Methods Non-heat-stressed HCC cells were cocultured with HCC cells or hepatocytes that were heat stressed at 37\u00b0C (physiologic), 45\u00b0C (moderate), or 50\u00b0C (severe) for 10 minutes and proliferation monitored with bioluminescence imaging for up to 6 days after heat stress (three experiments). Rats bearing orthotopic N1S1 HCC were randomly assigned to undergo immediate sham or laser thermal (3 W for 60 or 90 seconds; hereafter, 3W\u00d760s and 3W\u00d790s, respectively) ablation of the median (local) or left (distant) hepatic lobe, and tumor growth was monitored with magnetic resonance imaging for up to 18 days after ablation (six or more rats per group). Experiments were repeated with rats randomly assigned to receive either the adjuvant phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor (NVP-BEZ235) or the vehicle control. Heat-stressed HCC cells and hepatocytes were analyzed by using microarray or quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis for growth factor expression (three or more experiments). Groups were compared by using one- or two-way analysis of variance, and post hoc pairwise comparison was performed with the Dunnett test. Results There were more non-heat-stressed HCC cells when cells were cocultured with cells subjected to moderate but not physiologic or severe heat stress (P < .001 for both). Local intrahepatic N1S1 tumors were larger at day 18 in the 3W\u00d760s (mean, 3102 mm3 \u00b1 463 [standard error]; P = .004) and 3W\u00d790s (mean, 3538 mm3 \u00b1 667; P < .001) groups than in the sham group (mean, 1363 mm3 \u00b1 361) but not in distant intrahepatic tumors (P = .31). Adjuvant BEZ235 resulted in smaller N1S1 tumors in the BEZ235 and laser thermal ablation group than in the vehicle control and laser thermal ablation group (mean, 1731 mm3 \u00b1 1457 vs 3844 mm3 \u00b1 2400, P < .001). Moderate heat stress induced expression of growth factors in HCC cells and hepatocytes, including heparin-binding growth factor, fibroblast growth factor 21, and nerve growth factor (range, 2.9-66.9-fold; P < .05). Conclusion Moderate heat stress and laser thermal ablation induce hepatocellular carcinoma growth, which is prevented with adjuvant PI3K/mTOR/protein kinase B inhibition.", "Purpose To measure the diagnostic yield and false-referral rate (FRR) of staging contrast material\u2013enhanced chest CT based on the clinical stage from contrast-enhanced abdominal CT in patients with colon cancer. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included 1743 patients (mean age, 63.4 years; range, 18\u201396 years) with a diagnosis of colon cancer. The primary outcomes were diagnostic yield and FRR of contrast-enhanced chest CT in the detection of thoracic metastasis. The proportions of patients with occult thoracic metastasis and those undergoing pulmonary metastasectomy for true-positive metastases were key secondary outcomes. The outcomes were stratified according to clinical stage at contrast-enhanced abdominal CT. Results The diagnostic yields in clinical stage 0/I, cII, cIII, and cIV were 0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0%, 0.8%), 1.3% (95% CI: 0.4%, 3.3%), 4.4% (95% CI: 3.0%, 6.1%), and 43.3% (95% CI: 36.8%, 49.9%), respectively. The corresponding FRRs were 5.7% (95% CI: 3.8%, 8.2%), 2.9% (95% CI: 1.3%, 5.5%), 6.7% (95% CI: 5.0%, 8.8%), and 6.1% (95% CI: 3.4%, 10.0%), respectively. The proportions of patients with occult metastasis were 0% (95% CI: 0%, 0.8%), 3.3% (95% CI: 1.6%, 5.9%), 1.5% (95% CI: 0.8%, 2.7%), and 6.1% (95% CI: 3.4%, 10.0%), respectively. The proportion of patients who underwent pulmonary metastasectomy was 0% (none of 474; 95% CI: 0%, 0.8%) for clinical stage 0/I tumors. Conclusion In clinical stages 0 and I, the diagnostic yield of staging contrast-enhanced chest CT in detecting thoracic metastasis was zero. For clinical stages II, III, and IV, contrast-enhanced chest CT as a baseline examination was helpful for the detection of thoracic metastasis and allowed for the possibility of a curative metastasectomy. There was no significant association between clinical stage and false-referral rate. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.", "Purpose To determine the relationship between the presence or absence of mammographic calcifications in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancers and pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and to determine other tumor and clinical characteristics that may be predictive of such a response. Materials and Methods A database of all patients with HER2-positive breast cancer who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy between 2007 and 2015 was retrospectively reviewed. Patient demographic characteristics, mammographic appearance, molecular subtype of cancer (luminal or nonluminal), radiologic response (based on breast magnetic resonance images), surgery, and pathologic response to treatment were recorded. Inter- and subgroup comparison was performed for presence of mammographic microcalcification and cancer subtype by using Mann-Whitney and \u03c72 tests and logistic regression. Results A total of 111 patients with a median age of 49 years (interquartile range, 40\u201357 years) were evaluated. Of these, 64.9% (72 of 111) had mammographic microcalcifications, 63.1% (70 of 111) had luminal B cancer, and 36.9% (41 of 111) had nonluminal HER2-positive cancer. Radiologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was observed in 70.3% (78 of 111) of patients. Surgery was performed in 97.3% (108 of 111) of patients, and 30.6% (34 of 111) of patients underwent breast conservation. pCR was observed in 33.3% (37 of 111) of patients; 16.2% (18 of 111) showed residual ductal carcinoma in situ and 50.5% (56 of 111) had residual invasive disease. The pCR rate was the same (P = .21) in patients with mammographic microcalcification (29.2% [21 of 72]) as in those without calcification (41.0% [16 of 39]). The pCR rate in patients with nonluminal HER2-positive cancers (46.3% [19 of 41]) was higher (P = .01) than in those with luminal B cancers (25.7% [18 of 70]). pCR was associated with nonluminal HER2-positive subtype (odds ratio, 5.4; 95% confidence interval: 1.8, 16.0; P = .01) and complete radiologic response (odds ratio, 20.4; 95% confidence interval: 3.3, 126.6; P = .01). Conclusion Patients with HER2-positive cancer and mammographic microcalcification can achieve pCR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Nonluminal HER2-positive subtype and complete radiologic response are predictors of pCR. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.", "Background Evaluation of the glymphatic system with intrathecal contrast material injection has limited clinical use. Purpose To investigate the feasibility of using serial intravenous contrast-enhanced T1 mapping in the quantitative evaluation of putative dynamic glymphatic activity in various brain regions and to demonstrate the effect of sleep on glymphatic activity in humans. Materials and Methods In this prospective study from May 2019 to February 2020, 25 healthy participants (mean age, 25 years \u00b1 2 [standard deviation]; 15 men) underwent two cycles of MRI (day and night cycles). For each cycle, T1 maps were acquired at baseline and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, and 12 hours after intravenous contrast material injection. For the night cycle, participants had a normal night of sleep between 2 and 12 hours. The time (tmin) to reach the minimum T1 value (T1min), the absolute difference between baseline T1 and T1min (peak \u0394T1), and the slope between two measurements at 2 and 12 hours (slope[2h-12h]) were determined from T1 value-time curves in cerebral gray matter (GM), cerebral white matter (WM), cerebellar GM, cerebellar WM, and putamen. Mixed-model analysis of variance (ANOVA), Friedman test, and repeated-measures ANOVA were used to assess the effect of sleep on slope(2h-12h) and to compare tmin and peak \u0394T1 among different regions. Results The slope(2h-12h) increased from the day to night cycles in cerebral GM, cerebellar GM, and putamen (geometric mean ratio [night/day] = 1.4 [95% CI: 1.2, 1.7], 1.3 [95% CI: 1.1, 1.4], and 2.4 [95% CI: 1.6, 3.6], respectively; P = .001, P < .001, and P < .001, respectively). Median tmin values were 0.5 hour in cerebral and cerebellar GM and putamen for both cycles. Cerebellar GM had the highest mean peak \u0394T1, followed by cerebral GM and putamen in both day (159 msec \u00b1 6, 99 msec \u00b1 4, and 62 msec \u00b1 5, respectively) and night (152 msec \u00b1 6, 104 msec \u00b1 6, and 58 msec \u00b1 4, respectively) cycles. Conclusion Clearance of a gadolinium-based contrast agent was greater after sleep compared with daytime wakefulness. These results suggest that sleep was associated with greater glymphatic clearance compared with wakefulness. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

The patient had a history of normal erections and experienced the sensation of orgasm without ever ejaculating. On physical examination, both testes were present in the scrotum, with normal dimensions and a normal epididymis bilaterally. The patient had a slightly tender left testicle, and digital rectal examination findings were normal. The patient underwent further investigation for the possibility of retrograde ejaculation with urine cytology, the results of which were negative. Genetic testing was performed to exclude Y chromosome microdeletions. Serum-luteinizing and follicle-stimulating hormone levels were normal, with a borderline low level of testosterone (7.6 nmol/L; normal range, 8.0-29.0 nmol/L). All other pertinent laboratory results were noncontributory. Pelvic MRI was requested to exclude an anatomic cause of anejaculation. MRI was performed in accordance with the standard clinical prostate protocol, with a dynamic contrast material-enhanced study ( Figs 1 - 3 ). CT of the upper abdomen was also performed ( Fig 4 ). The patient subsequently underwent cystoscopy, which revealed an intravesicular fluid-filled mass near the left ureteric orifice ( Fig 5 ).

An MRI system was developed that combines low field strength (0.55 T) with high-performance imaging technology. Purpose To evaluate applications of a high-performance low-field-strength MRI system, specifically MRI-guided cardiovascular catheterizations with metallic devices, diagnostic imaging in high-susceptibility regions, and efficient image acquisition strategies. Materials and Methods A commercial 1.5-T MRI system was modified to operate at 0.55 T while maintaining high-performance hardware, shielded gradients (45 mT/m; 200 T/m/sec), and advanced imaging methods. MRI was performed between January 2018 and April 2019. T1, T2, and T2* were measured at 0.55 T; relaxivity of exogenous contrast agents was measured; and clinical applications advantageous at low field were evaluated. Results There were 83 0.55-T MRI examinations performed in study participants (45 women; mean age, 34 years \u00b1 13). On average, T1 was 32% shorter, T2 was 26% longer, and T2* was 40% longer at 0.55 T compared with 1.5 T. Nine metallic interventional devices were found to be intrinsically safe at 0.55 T (<1\u00b0C heating) and MRI-guided right heart catheterization was performed in seven study participants with commercial metallic guidewires. Compared with 1.5 T, reduced image distortion was shown in lungs, upper airway, cranial sinuses, and intestines because of improved field homogeneity. Oxygen inhalation generated lung signal enhancement of 19% \u00b1 11 (standard deviation) at 0.55 T compared with 7.6% \u00b1 6.3 at 1.5 T (P = .02; five participants) because of the increased T1 relaxivity of oxygen (4.7e\u22124 mmHg\u22121sec\u22121). Efficient spiral image acquisitions were amenable to low field strength and generated increased signal-to-noise ratio compared with Cartesian acquisitions (P < .02). Representative imaging of the brain, spine, abdomen, and heart generated good image quality with this system. Conclusion This initial study suggests that high-performance low-field-strength MRI offers advantages for MRI-guided catheterizations with metal devices, MRI in high-susceptibility regions, and efficient imaging. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

After onset of symptoms, the patient also experienced an accidental fall at home, resulting in a left fibular fracture, which was treated with reduction and with seven-hole plate Synthes Locking Compression Plate at the orthopedic clinic. The neurologic examination showed paresthesias on the posterior aspect of both thighs and crural regions that was worse on the left side, hypoesthesia in the L5 root region on the right side, and right foot drop. There was no urinary retention or fecal incontinence. The patient denied past surgery, back trauma, heavy manual labor, hypermobility, or any other remarkable medical history. The patient was afebrile. Laboratory results on the 1st day of hospitalization showed increased C-reactive protein level (0.62 mg/dL; reference range, 0.0-0.5 mg/dL), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (60 mm/h; reference range, 0-20 mm/h), and increased aspartate transaminase (38 U/L [0.63 \u03bckat/L]; reference range, 0-31 U/L [0-0.52 \u03bckat/L]), alanine transaminase (70 U/L [1.17 \u03bckat/L]; reference range, 0-31 U/L [0-0.52 \u03bckat/L]), and high lymphocyte (4.55 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL; reference range, [1.0-3.0] \u00d7 103/\u03bcL), and neutrophil (8.79 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL; reference range, [2.0-7.0] \u00d7 103/\u03bcL) levels. Absence of coagulopathy was demonstrated by normal coagulation values (international normalized ratio, 1.19; reference value, 0.80-1.25; activated partial thromboplastin time ratio, 0.88 second; reference range, 0.79-1.27 seconds). Electroneurography showed marked hypoevocable F response in the right tibia. Electromyography indicated severe reduction of muscle recruitment pertaining to right L4, L5, and S1 nerve territory and, to a lesser extent, of muscles pertaining to L3 territory bilaterally in the absence of spontaneous denervation.

Materials and Methods In a retrospective study, 216 431 frontal chest radiographs obtained between 1998 and 2012 were procured, along with associated text reports and a prospective label from the attending radiologist. This data set was used to train CNNs to classify chest radiographs as normal or abnormal before evaluation on a held-out set of 533 images hand-labeled by expert radiologists. The effects of development set size, training set size, initialization strategy, and network architecture on end performance were assessed by using standard binary classification metrics; detailed error analysis, including visualization of CNN activations, was also performed. Results Average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.96 for a CNN trained with 200 000 images. This AUC value was greater than that observed when the same model was trained with 2000 images (AUC = 0.84, P < .005) but was not significantly different from that observed when the model was trained with 20 000 images (AUC = 0.95, P > .05). Averaging the CNN output score with the binary prospective label yielded the best-performing classifier, with an AUC of 0.98 (P < .005). Analysis of specific radiographs revealed that the model was heavily influenced by clinically relevant spatial regions but did not reliably generalize beyond thoracic disease. Conclusion CNNs trained with a modestly sized collection of prospectively labeled chest radiographs achieved high diagnostic performance in the classification of chest radiographs as normal or abnormal; this function may be useful for automated prioritization of abnormal chest radiographs. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

This consensus document proposes standardized definitions for a broad range of oncologic outcome measures with recommendations on how to uniformly document, analyze, and report outcomes. The initiative was coordinated by the Society of Interventional Oncology in collaboration with the Definition for the Assessment of Time-to-Event End Points in Cancer Trials, or DATECAN, group. According to predefined criteria, based on experience with clinical trials, an international panel of 62 experts convened. Recommendations were developed using the validated three-step modified Delphi consensus method. Consensus was reached on when to assess outcomes per patient, per session, or per tumor; on starting and ending time and survival time definitions; and on time-to-event end points. Although no consensus was reached on the preferred classification system to report complications, quality of life, and health economics issues, the panel did agree on using the most recent version of a validated patient-reported outcome questionnaire. This article provides a framework of key opinion leader recommendations with the intent to facilitate a clear interpretation of results and standardize worldwide communication.

Purpose To investigate outcomes and factors associated with subsequent cancers following a negative screening MRI study in women with a PHBC. Materials and Methods Consecutive women with a PHBC and a negative prevalence screening breast MRI result between August 2014 and December 2016 were retrospectively identified. Inclusion criteria were prevalence screening MRI performed as part of routine surveillance protocol (1\u20133 years after treatment) and follow-up data for at least 12 months. The incidence and characteristics of subsequent cancers were reviewed. Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate associations between clinical-pathologic characteristics and subsequent cancers. Performance metrics were compared among screening MRI, mammography, and US. Results A total of 993 women (mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 53 years \u00b1 10) were evaluated. Ten second in-breast cancers (ie, ipsilateral or contralateral) occurred at a median interval of 31.8 months (range, 13.3\u201344.8 months) after MRI, of which eight (80%) were ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or node-negative T1 cancers. Only one node-negative T1mi (tumor \u22641 mm) second in-breast cancer visible on a mammogram was detected within 24 months of MRI. Of second in-breast cancers, 40% (four of 10) were detected only at subsequent screening MRI, which was performed a median of 30.5 months after negative prevalence screening MRI. Ten local-regional recurrences occurred at a median interval of 16.9 months (range, 6\u201335 months). Previous treatment for DCIS was associated with second in-breast cancers (odds ratio, 3.73; 95% CI: 1.04, 13.38; P = .04). In 1048 women who underwent prevalence screening MRI (including all Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System categories), MRI showed a lower abnormal interpretation rate and higher specificity than mammography or US (P < .001 for all). Conclusion After a negative screening MRI result, 90% of subsequent cancers were detected at intervals longer than 24 months and there was a low second in-breast cancer rate (1%). \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 Supplemental material is available for this article.

Purpose To investigate the diagnostic value and consistency of chest CT as compared with RT-PCR assay in COVID-19. Materials and Methods This study included 1014 patients in Wuhan, China, who underwent both chest CT and RT-PCR tests between January 6 and February 6, 2020. With use of RT-PCR as the reference standard, the performance of chest CT in the diagnosis of COVID-19 was assessed. In addition, for patients with multiple RT-PCR assays, the dynamic conversion of RT-PCR results (negative to positive, positive to negative) was analyzed as compared with serial chest CT scans for those with a time interval between RT-PCR tests of 4 days or more. Results Of the 1014 patients, 601 of 1014 (59%) had positive RT-PCR results and 888 of 1014 (88%) had positive chest CT scans. The sensitivity of chest CT in suggesting COVID-19 was 97% (95% confidence interval: 95%, 98%; 580 of 601 patients) based on positive RT-PCR results. In the 413 patients with negative RT-PCR results, 308 of 413 (75%) had positive chest CT findings. Of those 308 patients, 48% (103 of 308) were considered as highly likely cases and 33% (103 of 308) as probable cases. At analysis of serial RT-PCR assays and CT scans, the mean interval between the initial negative to positive RT-PCR results was 5.1 days \u00b1 1.5; the mean interval between initial positive to subsequent negative RT-PCR results was 6.9 days \u00b1 2.3. Of the 1014 patients, 60% (34 of 57) to 93% (14 of 15) had initial positive CT scans consistent with COVID-19 before (or parallel to) the initial positive RT-PCR results. Twenty-four of 57 patients (42%) showed improvement on follow-up chest CT scans before the RT-PCR results turned negative. Conclusion Chest CT has a high sensitivity for diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Chest CT may be considered as a primary tool for the current COVID-19 detection in epidemic areas. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020", "Purpose To investigate the association between exposure to head computed tomography (CT) and subsequent risk of meningioma. Materials and Methods The study was approved by the local ethics committee. A cohort of 26 370 subjects was retrospectively collected from a radiology archive of CT examinations of the head performed from 1973 through 1992. For comparison, an age- and sex-matched cohort of 96 940 subjects who were not exposed to CT (unexposed cohort) was gathered. The risk of meningioma was assessed by using data from the Swedish Cancer Registry; however, one-third of patients with meningioma had to be excluded because they either had a prevalent meningioma or other brain tumor at the first CT examination or had undergone radiation treatment to the head. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated from time of exposure to the occurrence of meningioma or death or until December 31, 2010, with logistic regression. Results Comparison of exposed and unexposed cohorts showed that there was no statistically significant increase in the risk of meningioma after exposure to CT of the head (HR: 1.49; 95% confidence interval: 0.97, 2.30; P = .07). If incident cases at the time of the first CT examination were not excluded, the risk of meningioma would have been falsely increased (HR: 2.28; 95% confidence interval: 1.56, 3.33; P = .0001). Conclusion When prevalent cases of meningioma at first exposure to CT of the head are excluded, no statistically significant increase in risk of meningioma was found among exposed subjects compared with unexposed control subjects. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017", "The four grand challenges of imaging research\u2014increasing evidence levels, enhancing global collaboration, improving research reporting quality, and sharing trial data\u2014can be addressed, utilizing the tail wind of digital transformation, by consolidating actions of all stakeholders, with the ultimate goal of evidence-based, reproducible, generalizable, and broadly accepted results that will improve the quality and consistency of patient care.", "Purpose To determine the concordance and accuracy of imaging surrogates of immunohistochemical (IHC) markers and the molecular classification of breast cancer. Materials and Methods A total of 3050 patients from 17 public breast cancer data sets containing IHC marker receptor status (estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]) and their molecular classification (basal-like, HER2-enriched, luminal A or B) were analyzed. Diagnostic accuracy and concordance as measured with the \u03ba statistic were calculated between the IHC and molecular classifications. Simulations were performed to assess the relationship between accuracy of imaging-based IHC markers to predict molecular classification. A simulation was performed to examine effects of misclassification of molecular type on patient survival. Results Accuracies of intrinsic subtypes based on IHC subtype were 71.7% (luminal A), 53.7% (luminal B), 64.8% (HER2-enriched), and 81.7% (basal-like). The \u03ba agreement was fair (\u03ba = 0.36) for luminal A and HER2-enriched subtypes, good (\u03ba = 0.65) for the basal-like subtype, and poor (\u03ba = 0.09) for the luminal B subtypes. Introduction of image misclassification by simulation lowered image-true subtype accuracies and \u03ba values. Simulation analysis showed that misclassification caused survival differences between luminal A and basal-like subtypes to decrease. Conclusion There is poor concordance between triple-receptor status and intrinsic molecular subtype in breast cancer, arguing against their use in the design of prognostic genomic-based image biomarkers. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.", "A 38-year-old man who had been in a motor vehicle collision was referred to our institute.

The clinical information and noninvasive liver stiffness measurement tests (ARFI, Fibrosis-4 index [FIB-4], and FibroScan) were collected. Serial ARFI measurements were compared in patients without antiviral therapy (nontreatment group) and during antiviral therapy (treatment group). The linear mixed-effects model with random coefficients was used to compare longitudinal repeated measurements. Results A total of 559 patients undergoing serial ARFI examinations were included. The ARFI value correlated with FIB-4 (correlation coefficient = 0.55, P < .001) and FibroScan (correlation coefficient = 0.69, P < .001) results. There were 314 patients with five or more ARFI measurements in more than 3 years of follow-up. The ARFI value remained unchanged in the nontreatment group (n = 189, from 1.11 to 1.11 m/sec, time trend P = .911). However, the ARFI value declined significantly in the treatment group (n = 125, from 1.63 to 1.37 m/sec, time trend P < .001), both in patients with cirrhosis (n = 51, from 2.15 to 1.75 m/sec, time trend P < .001) and in those without (n = 74, from 1.27 to 1.11 m/sec, time trend P < .001). Conclusion ARFI US imaging is an important clinical noninvasive test for liver stiffness measurement and can be used for serial measurements in the management of chronic hepatitis B. Antiviral therapy significantly reduces liver stiffness during longitudinal follow-up. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.", "History In 2017, a 72-year-old woman was seen in the gastroenterology department with a 2-month history of mild and intermittent abdominal pain without other accompanying symptoms. Her medical history was unremarkable, except for a previous visit due to facial photodermatitis 3 years earlier. Diazepam for a sleeping disorder was the only chronic medication recorded. Results of physical examination, blood count, and basic metabolic panels including assessment of renal and liver function were normal; only the ferritin level was slightly elevated (265 ng/mL [595 pmol/L]; normal range, 10-120 ng/mL [22-269 pmol/L]). Abdominal US was performed, followed by multiphasic contrast-enhanced CT and liver MRI due to the findings of the first study. A diagnosis was not established in that moment, and acetaminophen was prescribed for pain relief. As the symptoms continued, laboratory tests and imaging studies were repeated 2 years later, with similar findings and no notable changes (Figs 1-5).", "History A 25-year-old woman was referred to our breast clinic for assessment of a palpable mass in her left breast that developed quickly in 2 weeks. She denied any associated fever, chills, redness, or pain. She had no relevant medical or surgical history; no evidence of recent pregnancy, abortion, or breastfeeding; and no family history of breast cancer. Clinical examination enabled confirmation of a firm mass occupying the retroareolar region and the outer quadrant of the left breast with no skin retraction, edema, or erythema. There was no evidence of enlarged axillary lymph nodes. US of the left breast (Fig 1), bilateral breast MRI (Fig 2), and fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT (Fig 3) were performed.", "Background Developments in artificial intelligence (AI) systems to assist radiologists in reading mammograms could improve breast cancer screening efficiency. Purpose To investigate whether an AI system could detect normal, moderate-risk, and suspicious mammograms in a screening sample to safely reduce radiologist workload and evaluate across Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) densities. Materials and Methods This retrospective simulation study analyzed mammographic examination data consecutively collected from January 2014 to December 2015 in the Danish Capital Region breast cancer screening program. All mammograms were scored from 0 to 10, representing the risk of malignancy, using an AI tool. During simulation, normal mammograms (score < 5) would be excluded from radiologist reading and suspicious mammograms (score > recall threshold [RT]) would be recalled. Two radiologists read the remaining mammograms. The RT was fitted using another independent cohort (same institution) by matching to the radiologist sensitivity. This protocol was further applied to each BI-RADS density. Screening outcomes were measured using the sensitivity, specificity, workload, and false-positive rate. The AI-based screening was tested for noninferiority sensitivity compared with radiologist screening using the Farrington-Manning test. Specificities were compared using the McNemar test. Results The study sample comprised 114 421 screenings for breast cancer in 114 421 women, resulting in 791 screen-detected, 327 interval, and 1473 long-term cancers and 2107 false-positive screenings. The mean age of the women was 59 years \u00b1 6 (SD). The AI-based screening sensitivity was 69.7% (779 of 1118; 95% CI: 66.9, 72.4) and was noninferior (P = .02) to the radiologist screening sensitivity of 70.8% (791 of 1118; 95% CI: 68.0, 73.5). The AI-based screening specificity was 98.6% (111 725 of 113 303; 95% CI: 98.5, 98.7), which was higher (P < .001) than the radiologist specificity of 98.1% (111 196 of 113 303; 95% CI: 98.1, 98.2). The radiologist workload was reduced by 62.6% (71 585 of 114 421), and 25.1% (529 of 2107) of false-positive screenings were avoided. Screening results were consistent across BI-RADS densities, although not significantly so for sensitivity. Conclusion Artificial intelligence (AI)\u2013based screening could detect normal, moderate-risk, and suspicious mammograms in a breast cancer screening program, which may reduce the radiologist workload. AI-based screening performed consistently across breast densities. \u00a9 RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article."], "label": ["unimpactful", "impactful", "impactful", "impactful", "unimpactful", "impactful", "impactful", "unimpactful", "unimpactful", "impactful", "unimpactful", "impactful", "unimpactful", "unimpactful", "unimpactful", "impactful", "unimpactful", "impactful", "unimpactful", "impactful", "impactful", "unimpactful", "impactful", "unimpactful", "unimpactful", "unimpactful", "unimpactful", "impactful", "unimpactful", "unimpactful", "unimpactful", "impactful"]}
