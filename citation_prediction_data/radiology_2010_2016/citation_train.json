        "Purpose To prospectively compare gadoxetate disodium\u2013enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with multiphasic 64-section multidetector computed tomography (CT) in the detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with cirrhosis. Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval and informed patient consent were obtained for this prospective study. Fifty-eight patients (39 men, 19 women; mean age, 63 years; age range, 35\u201384 years) underwent gadoxetate disodium\u2013enhanced MR imaging and multiphasic 64-section multidetector CT. The imaging examinations were performed within 30 days of each other. The two sets of images were qualitatively analyzed in random order by three independent readers in a blinded and retrospective fashion. Using strict diagnostic criteria for HCC, readers classified all detected lesions with use of a four-point confidence scale. The reference standard was a combination of pathologic proof, conclusive imaging findings, and substantial tumor growth at follow-up CT or MR imaging (range of follow-up, 90\u2013370 days). The diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and positive predictive value were compared between the two image sets. Interreader variability was assessed. The accuracy of each imaging method was determined by using an adjusted modified \u03c72 test. Results Eighty-seven HCCs (mean size \u00b1 standard deviation, 1.8 cm \u00b1 1.5; range, 0.3\u20137.0 cm) were confirmed in 42 of the 58 patients. Regardless of lesion size, the average diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity for all readers were significantly greater with gadoxetate disodium\u2013enhanced MR imaging (average diagnostic accuracy: 0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.80, 0.97; average sensitivity: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.74, 0.96) than with multidetector CT (average diagnostic accuracy: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.82; average sensitivity: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.59, 0.79) (P < .001 for each). No significant difference in positive predictive value was observed between the two image sets for each reader. Interreader agreement was good to excellent. Conclusion Compared with multiphasic 64-section multidetector CT, gadoxetate disodium\u2013enhanced MR imaging yields significantly higher diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity in the detection of HCC in patients with cirrhosis. \u00a9 RSNA, 2010",
        "To determine the risk of emergent dialysis and short-term mortality following intravenous iodinated contrast material exposure.This single-center retrospective study was HIPAA compliant and institutional review board approved. All contrast material-enhanced (contrast group) and unenhanced (noncontrast group) abdominal, pelvic, and thoracic computed tomography scans from 2000-2010 were identified. Patients in the contrast and noncontrast groups were compared following propensity score-based 1:1 matching to reduce intergroup selection bias. Patients with preexisting diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, or chronic or acute renal failure were identified as high-risk patient subgroups for nephrotoxicity. The effects of contrast material exposure on the rate of acute kidney injury ( AKI acute kidney injury ) (serum creatinine level \u2265 0.5 mg/dL [44.2 \u03bcmol/L] above baseline within 24-72 hours of exposure) and dialysis or death within 30 days of exposure were determined by using odds ratios ( OR odds ratio s) and covariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. Results were validated with a bootstrapped sensitivity analysis.The 1:1 matching on the basis of the propensity score yielded a cohort of 21 346 patients (10 673 in the contrast group, 10 673 in the noncontrast group). Within this cohort, the risks of AKI acute kidney injury ( OR odds ratio , 0.94; 95% confidence interval [ CI confidence interval ]: 0.83, 1.07; P = .38), emergent dialysis ( OR odds ratio , 0.96; 95% CI confidence interval : 0.54, 1.60; P = .89), and 30-day mortality (hazard ratio [ HR hazard ratio ], 0.97; 95% CI confidence interval : 0.87, 1.06; P = .45) were not significantly different between the contrast group and the noncontrast group. Although patients who developed AKI acute kidney injury had higher rates of dialysis and mortality, contrast material exposure was not an independent risk factor for either outcome for dialysis ( OR odds ratio , 0.89; 95% CI confidence interval : 0.40, 2.01; P = .78) or for mortality ( HR hazard ratio , 1.03; 95% CI confidence interval : 0.82, 1.32; P = .63), even among patients with compromised renal function or predisposing comorbidities.Intravenous contrast material administration was not associated with excess risk of AKI acute kidney injury , dialysis, or death, even among patients with comorbidities reported to predispose them to nephrotoxicity.",
        "To observe the longitudinal changes of nerve repair in rats after tissue-engineered construct implantation at magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and to determine whether the enhanced nerve regeneration with use of tissue-engineered constructs could be monitored with gadofluorine M-enhanced MR imaging or nerve T2 relaxation time measurement.All experimental protocols were approved by the institutional Animal Use and Care Committee. Tissue-engineered constructs were prepared by seeding mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into chitosan nerve tubes. Thirty-six rats with sciatic nerve transection injury underwent nerve tube implantation with (n = 18) or without (n = 18) MSC seeding. Sequential T2 measurement, gadofluorine M-enhanced MR imaging, and sciatic function index measurement were performed over an 8-week follow-up period, with histologic assessments performed at regular intervals. T2 relaxation times and signal intensity at gadofluorine M-enhanced T1-weighted imaging were measured and were compared by using repeated-measures analysis of variance followed by the Student-Neuman-Keuls post-hoc test for multiple pairwise comparisons.Nerve T2 relaxation times and gadofluorine M enhancement, as well as functional changes, showed a similar time course. Nerves implanted with MSC-seeded tubes achieved slightly better functional recovery and enhanced nerve regeneration while showing a slower return to baseline T2 relaxation time and a more rapid decline in gadofluorine M enhancement compared with nerves implanted with chitosan tubes alone. T2 values of the distal portion of transected nerves showed a more rapid return to baseline level than did gadofluorine M enhancement.Peripheral nerve repair with use of tissue-engineered constructs can be monitored by using gadofluorine M-enhanced MR imaging and T2 relaxation time measurements. T2 relaxation time seems more sensitive than gadofluorine M-enhanced MR imaging for detecting nerve regeneration.",
        "Purpose To evaluate the feasibility of using intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) diffusion-weighted imaging with multiple b values for the noninvasive diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Materials and Methods This study was approved by the institutional animal care and use committee. Twenty-seven 8-week-old rabbits were fed a variety of diets (from a standard diet to a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet) before IVIM diffusion-weighted imaging was performed with seven b values by using a 3-T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging unit. At histologic analysis of the animals, livers were categorized by NAFLD severity as normal, NAFLD, borderline nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), or NASH. The apparent diffusion coefficient and IVIM-derived parameters including true diffusion coefficient, pseudodiffusion coefficient, and perfusion fraction of the liver parenchyma were measured. Each parameter was correlated with NAFLD severity, and optimal cutoff values were determined by means of receiver operating characteristics analysis. Results Perfusion fraction was significantly lower in rabbits with NAFLD than in those with a normal liver, and it decreased further as severity of NAFLD increased, with medians of 22.2%, 14.8%, 11.3%, and 9.5% in the rabbits in the normal, NAFLD, borderline, and NASH groups, respectively (\u03c1 = \u22120.83, P < .001). Apparent diffusion coefficient, true diffusion coefficient, and pseudodiffusion coefficient were not significantly different between the NAFLD severity groups. In terms of the diagnostic performance of perfusion fraction, area under the curve values were 0.984 (normal vs NAFLD or more severe disease), 0.959 (NAFLD or less severe vs borderline or more severe disease), and 0.903 (borderline or less severe vs NASH) with optimal cutoff values of 15.2%, 13.2%, and 11.0%, respectively. Conclusion Perfusion fractions extracted from IVIM diffusion-weighted imaging may help in the differentiation of early stage NASH from simple steatosis. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",

        "Purpose To assess cerebral microbleed (CMB) prevalence in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and associations with clinical outcomes. Materials and Methods CMBs are associated with aging and neurodegenerative disorders. The prevalence of CMBs has not previously been well established. In this study, 445 patients with MS (266 with relapsing-remitting MS, 138 with secondary progressive MS, and 41 with primary progressive MS), 45 patients with CIS, 51 patients with other neurological diseases, and 177 healthy control subjects (HCs) underwent 3-T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and clinical examinations. A subset of 168 patients with MS and 50 HCs underwent neuropsychological testing. Number of CMBs was assessed on susceptibility-weighted minimum intensity projections by using the Microbleed Anatomic Rating Scale; volume was calculated by using quantitative susceptibility maps. Differences between groups were analyzed with the \u03c72 test, Fisher exact test, Student t test, and analysis of variance; associations of CMBs with clinical and other MR imaging outcomes were explored with correlation and regression analyses. Because CMB frequency increases with age, prevalence was investigated in participants at least 50 years of age and younger than 50 years. Results Significantly more patients with MS than HCs had CMBs (19.8% vs 7.4%, respectively; P = .01) in the group at least 50 years old. A trend toward greater presence of CMBs was found in patients with MS (P = .016) and patients with CIS who were younger than 50 years (P = .039) compared with HCs. In regression analysis adjusted for age, hypertension, and normalized brain volume, increased number of CMBs was significantly associated with increased physical disability in the MS population (R2 = 0.23, P < .0001). In correlation analysis, increased number of CMBs was significantly associated with deteriorated auditory and verbal learning and memory (P = .006) and visual information processing speed trends (P = .049) in patients with MS. Conclusion Monitoring CMBs may be relevant in patients with MS and CIS at higher risk for developing cognitive and physical disability. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of computed tomography (CT)-guided radiofrequency (RF) neurolysis (RFN) in the management of refractory inguinal neuralgia.Local institutional review board approval was obtained and written informed consent was waived. Twelve patients 26-75 years of age with chronic (>6 months) inguinal pain refractory to specific medication were included between 2005 and 2011. Data on patient demographics, clinical history, and pain management history were retrospectively assessed. Pain was measured on a visual analog scale (VAS) from 0 to 10 before and immediately after the procedure and at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Diagnosis was always confirmed by a positive nerve block test result. Ambulatory CT-guided RF was the rule.Sixteen RFN procedures were performed. Pain was present for an average of 3.2 years (range: 2-8 years) prior to initial RFN. Mean VAS score before the procedure was 7.75 of 10. Immediate pain relief of 100% was achieved in all patients. Pain reduction at 1-, 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-up was statistically significant. Important pain reduction (\u226580%) was obtained in 75% of RFN procedures at 6-month follow-up and in 50% of cases at 12 months. The mean duration of pain relief was 11.8 months after RFN, with a maximum average pain reduction of 84.5%. No complications were noted during or after the procedure.RFN with CT guidance is an effective technique in the management of refractory inguinal pain with lasting satisfactory pain reduction; it may be considered as an alternative treatment to surgery. These results should be confirmed in a controlled trial with a larger series of patients.",
        "Image-guided tumor ablation has become a well-established hallmark of local cancer therapy. The breadth of options available in this growing field increases the need for standardization of terminology and reporting criteria to facilitate effective communication of ideas and appropriate comparison among treatments that use different technologies, such as chemical (eg, ethanol or acetic acid) ablation, thermal therapies (eg, radiofrequency, laser, microwave, focused ultrasound, and cryoablation) and newer ablative modalities such as irreversible electroporation. This updated consensus document provides a framework that will facilitate the clearest communication among investigators regarding ablative technologies. An appropriate vehicle is proposed for reporting the various aspects of image-guided ablation therapy including classification of therapies, procedure terms, descriptors of imaging guidance, and terminology for imaging and pathologic findings. Methods are addressed for standardizing reporting of technique, follow-up, complications, and clinical results. As noted in the original document from 2003, adherence to the recommendations will improve the precision of communications in this field, leading to more accurate comparison of technologies and results, and ultimately to improved patient outcomes.

        "Purpose To assess whether magnetic resonance (MR) angiography can be used as a noninvasive alternative to intraarterial digital subtraction angiography (DSA) to indicate additional treatment in the follow-up of patients with coil-treated intracranial aneurysms. Materials and Methods This was an ethics committee\u2013approved multicenter study. Consecutive patients who were scheduled for follow-up intraarterial DSA after coil placement were invited for additional MR angiography after providing written informed consent. Interventional neuroradiologists gave treatment advice (additional treatment, extended follow-up imaging, or discharge from follow-up) for each imaging modality. Agreement between treatment advices based on intraarterial DSA and MR angiographic findings and interobserver agreement were assessed with weighted \u03ba statistics. Results Agreement between intraarterial DSA- and MR angiography\u2013based treatment recommendations was substantial (\u03ba = 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.66, 0.80). In 34 of the 310 patients (11%), the advice was additional treatment based on findings of both modalities. In six patients (2%), the advice based on intraarterial DSA findings was additional treatment, while that based on MR angiographic findings was extended follow-up imaging; therefore, none of these patients were discharged from follow-up on the basis of MR angiographic findings. In six other patients (2%), the advice based on MR angiographic findings was additional treatment, while that based on intraarterial DSA findings was extended follow-up imaging (four patients), discharge from follow-up (one patient), and noninterpretable DSA (one patient). Extended follow-up imaging was suggested for 37 patients (12%) after intraarterial DSA and for 49 patients (16%) after MR angiography (difference: 4%; 95% CI: \u22120.6%, 8.4%). Interobserver agreement was substantial for intraarterial DSA (\u03ba = 0.73; 95% CI: 0.64, 0.82) and moderate for MR angiography (\u03ba = 0.53; 95% CI: 0.36, 0.70). Conclusion The overall proportion of patients advised to undergo additional treatment is similar based on intraarterial DSA and MR angiographic findings, with only few individual discrepancies. MR angiography can therefore be used for therapeutic decision making in the follow-up of patients with coil-treated aneurysms. \u00a9 RSNA, 2012 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.12112608/-/DC1",
        "To evaluate the diagnostic performance of multiparametric (MP) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for prostate cancer detection by using transperineal template prostate mapping (TTPM) biopsies as the reference standard and to determine the potential ability of MP MR imaging to identify clinically significant prostate cancer.Institutional review board exemption was granted by the local research ethics committee for this retrospective study. Included were 64 men (mean age, 62 years [range, 40-76]; mean prostate-specific antigen, 8.2 ng/mL [8.2 \u03bcg/L] [range, 2.1-43 ng/mL]), 51 with biopsy-proved cancer and 13 suspected of having clinically significant cancer that was biopsy negative or without prior biopsy. MP MR imaging included T2-weighted, dynamic contrast-enhanced and diffusion-weighted imaging (1.5 T, pelvic phased-array coil). Three radiologists independently reviewed images and were blinded to results of biopsy. Two-by-two tables were derived by using sectors of analysis of four quadrants, two lobes, and one whole prostate. Primary target definition for clinically significant disease necessary to be present within a sector of analysis on TTPM for that sector to be deemed positive was set at Gleason score of 3+4 or more and/or cancer core length involvement of 4 mm or more. Sensitivity, negative predictive value, and negative likelihood ratio were calculated to determine ability of MP MR imaging to rule out cancer. Specificity, positive predictive value, positive likelihood ratio, accuracy (overall fraction correct), and area under receiver operating characteristic curves were also calculated.Twenty-eight percent (71 of 256) of sectors had clinically significant cancer by primary endpoint definition. For primary endpoint definition (\u2265 4 mm and/or Gleason score \u2265 3+4), sensitivity, negative predictive value, and negative likelihood ratios were 58%-73%, 84%-89%, and 0.3-0.5, respectively. Specificity, positive predictive value, and positive likelihood ratios were 71%-84%, 49%-63%, and 2.-3.44, respectively. Area under the curve values were 0.73-0.84.Results of this study indicate that MP MR imaging has a high negative predictive value to rule out clinically significant prostate cancer and may potentially have clinical use in diagnostic pathways of men at risk.",
        "To determine the effect of evidence-based clinical decision support (CDS) on the use and yield of computed tomographic (CT) pulmonary angiography for acute pulmonary embolism (PE) in the emergency department (ED).Institutional review board approval was obtained for this HIPAA-compliant study, which was performed between October 1, 2003, and September 30, 2009, at a 793-bed quaternary care institution with 60,000 annual ED visits. Use (number of examinations per 1000 ED visits) and yield (percentage of examinations positive for acute PE) of CT pulmonary angiography were compared before and after CDS implementation in August 2007. The authors included all adult patients presenting to the ED and developed and validated a natural language processing tool to identify acute PE diagnoses. Linear trend analysis was used to assess for variation in CT pulmonary angiography use. Logistic regression was used to determine variation in yield after controlling for patient demographic and clinical characteristics.Of 338,230 patients presenting to the ED, 6838 (2.0%) underwent CT pulmonary angiography. Quarterly CT pulmonary angiography use increased 82.1% before CDS implementation, from 14.5 to 26.4 examinations per 1000 patients (P<.0001) between October 10, 2003, and July 31, 2007. After CDS implementation, quarterly use decreased 20.1%, from 26.4 to 21.1 examinations per 1000 patients between August 1, 2007, and September 30, 2009 (P=.0379). Overall, 686 (10.0%) of the CT pulmonary angiographic examinations performed during the 6-year period were positive for PE; subsequent to CDS implementation, yield by quarter increased 69.0%, from 5.8% to 9.8% (P=.0323).Implementation of evidence-based CDS in the ED was associated with a significant decrease in use, and increase in yield, of CT pulmonary angiography for the evaluation of acute PE.",
        "Purpose To prospectively evaluate the usefulness of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for estimating pulmonary blood volume (PBV) and the variation in PBV throughout the cardiac cycle in experimental heart failure. Materials and Methods The animal care committee approved this prospective study. Seven pigs were studied before and after myocardial infarction. PBV measurement was validated in a phantom and calculated as the product of cardiac output determined with velocity-encoded MR imaging and the pulmonary transit time for an intravenous bolus of contrast material to pass through the pulmonary circulation. The difference in arterial and venous pulmonary flow during the cardiac cycle was integrated for calculation of the PBV variation (expressed as percentage of stroke volume). Differences were evaluated with the Wilcoxon test. Results Calculated and direct phantom measurements of PBV differed by a mean of 4% \u00b1 3 (standard deviation) (R2 = 0.97, P < .001). Infarction induced a decrease in left ventricular stroke volume (44 mL \u00b1 6 vs 27 mL \u00b1 7; P = .02), ejection fraction (55% \u00b1 5 vs 41% \u00b1 4; P = .02), and PBV variation (61% \u00b1 12 vs 43% \u00b1 15; P = .04) but not PBV (225 mL \u00b1 23 vs 211 mL \u00b1 42; P = .50). The mean pulmonary artery pressure increased after infarction (19 mm Hg \u00b1 6 vs 27 mm Hg \u00b1 4; P = .04). Conclusion Following infarction, the PBV variation but not PBV decreased. PBV variation was the noninvasive measure exhibiting the greatest percentage of change following infarction. MR imaging can be used to assess the variation of the PBV during the cardiac cycle as a marker of heart failure. \u00a9 RSNA, 2010",

There was no relevant surgical or family history. The general physical examination findings were unremarkable, with a normal abdomen at both visual inspection and palpation; urogenital examination revealed a small left-sided palpable mass of the testis, compatible with an inguinal hernia or hydrocele. At first, gray-scale and color Doppler ultrasonographic (US) images of the testes and the inguinoscrotal region were obtained. Contrast material-enhanced computed tomographic (CT) images of the lower abdomen and pelvis were then obtained to further evaluate the urinary tract.",
        "Purpose To identify the ability of computer-derived three-dimensional (3D) computed tomographic (CT) segmentation techniques to help differentiate lung adenocarcinoma subtypes. Materials and Methods This study had institutional research board approval and was HIPAA compliant. Pathologically classified resected lung adenocarcinomas (n = 41) with thin-section CT data were identified. Two readers independently placed over-inclusive volumes around nodules from which automated computer measurements were generated: mass (total mass) and volume (total volume) of the nodule and of any solid portion, in addition to the solid percentage of the nodule volume (percentage solid volume) or mass (percentage solid mass). Interobserver agreement and differences in measurements among pathologic entities were evaluated by using t tests. A multinomial logistic regression model was used to differentiate the probability of three diagnoses: invasive non-lepidic-predominant adenocarcinoma (INV), lepidic-predominant adenocarcinoma (LPA), and adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS)/minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA). Results Mean percentage solid volume of INV was 35.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 26.2%, 44.5%)-higher than the 14.5% (95% CI: 10.3%, 18.7%) for LPA (P = .002). Mean percentage solid volume of AIS/MIA was 8.2% (95% CI: 2.7%, 13.7%) and had a trend toward being lower than that for LPA (P = .051). Accuracy of the model based on total volume and percentage solid volume was 73.2%; accuracy of the model based on total mass and percentage solid mass was 75.6%. Conclusion Computer-assisted 3D measurement of nodules at CT had good reproducibility and helped differentiate among subtypes of lung adenocarcinoma. (\u00a9) RSNA, 2016.",
        "This Special Report presents the consensus of the Summit on Management of Radiation Dose in Computed Tomography (CT) (held in February 2011), which brought together participants from academia, clinical practice, industry, and regulatory and funding agencies to identify the steps required to reduce the effective dose from routine CT examinations to less than 1 mSv. The most promising technologies and methods discussed at the summit include innovations and developments in x-ray sources; detectors; and image reconstruction, noise reduction, and postprocessing algorithms. Access to raw projection data and standard data sets for algorithm validation and optimization is a clear need, as is the need for new, clinically relevant metrics of image quality and diagnostic performance. Current commercially available techniques such as automatic exposure control, optimization of tube potential, beam-shaping filters, and dynamic z-axis collimators are important, and education to successfully implement these methods routinely is critically needed. Other methods that are just becoming widely available, such as iterative reconstruction, noise reduction, and postprocessing algorithms, will also have an important role. Together, these existing techniques can reduce dose by a factor of two to four. Technical advances that show considerable promise for additional dose reduction but are several years or more from commercial availability include compressed sensing, volume of interest and interior tomography techniques, and photon-counting detectors. This report offers a strategic roadmap for the CT user and research and manufacturer communities toward routinely achieving effective doses of less than 1 mSv, which is well below the average annual dose from naturally occurring sources of radiation.",
        "To investigate the diagnostic value of a half dose compared with a full dose of gadobenate dimeglumine in the assessment of synovitis or tenosynovitis in the wrist and finger joints in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and a disease activity score greater than 3.2.With institutional review board approval and informed consent, 57 patients with early RA underwent 3-T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with two different doses of contrast media. The contrast enhancement was measured in inflamed synovial tissue at half dose (0.05 mmol per kilogram of body weight) and at full dose (0.1 mmol/kg) by using T1-weighted sequences with fat saturation. The differences and the correlation of signal intensities (SIs) at half- and full-dose sequences were compared by using the paired t test and Pearson correlations. Image quality, Rheumatoid Arthritis MRI Score (RAMRIS), and tenosynovitis score on half- and full-dose images were compared by two observers using the Wilcoxon test. Interrater agreement was assessed by using \u03ba statistics.A significant difference in SI was found between half-dose and full-dose gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced synovial tissue (mean: 914.35 \u00b1 251.1 vs 1022 \u00b1 244.5, P < .001). Because the SI showed high correlation between the ratio at half dose and full dose (r = 0.875), the formula, ratio of synovial enhancement to saline syringe at full dose = 0.337 + 1.070 \u00d7 ratio of synovial enhancement to saline syringe at half dose, can be used to convert the normalized value of half dose to full dose. However, no difference in RAMRIS (score 0 in 490 of 1026 joints; score 1 in 344; score 2 in 158; and score 3 in 34) or tenosynovitis scores in grading synovitis or tenosynovitis in image quality and in assessment of synovial enhancement was detected between half-dose and full-dose images (P = 1).Postcontrast synovial SIs showed high correlation between half dose and full dose, and image quality was rated identically. Therefore, half-dose gadobenate dimeglumine at 3-T MR imaging may be sufficient for assessing synovitis or tenosynovitis in early RA.",
        "To determine radiation doses from coronary computed tomographic (CT) angiography performed by using a 320-detector row volume scanner and evaluate how the effective dose depends on scan mode and the calculation method used.Radiation doses from coronary CT angiography performed by using a volume scanner were determined by using metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor detectors positioned in an anthropomorphic phantom physically and radiographically simulating a male or female human. Organ and effective doses were determined for six scan modes, including both 64-row helical and 280-row volume scans. Effective doses were compared with estimates based on the method most commonly used in clinical literature: multiplying dose-length product (DLP) by a general conversion coefficient (0.017 or 0.014 mSv.mGy(-1).cm(-1)), determined from Monte Carlo simulations of chest CT by using single-section scanners and previous tissue-weighting factors.Effective dose was reduced by up to 91% with volume scanning relative to helical scanning, with similar image noise. Effective dose, determined by using International Commission on Radiological Protection publication 103 tissue-weighting factors, was 8.2 mSv, using volume scanning with exposure permitting a wide reconstruction window, 5.8 mSv with optimized exposure and 4.4 mSv for optimized 100-kVp scanning. Estimating effective dose with a chest conversion coefficient resulted in a dose as low as 1.8 mSv, substantially underestimating effective dose for both volume and helical coronary CT angiography.Volume scanning markedly decreases coronary CT angiography radiation doses compared with those at helical scanning. When conversion coefficients are used to estimate effective dose from DLP, they should be appropriate for the scanner and scan mode used and reflect current tissue-weighting factors.

        "Purpose To determine the rate at which computed tomographically guided pelvic percutaneous bone biopsy in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) yields adequate tissue for genomic profiling and to identify issues likely to affect diagnostic yields. Materials and Methods This study was institutional review board approved, and written informed consent was obtained. In a phase II trial assessing response to everolimus, 31 men with mCRPC underwent 54 biopsy procedures (eight men before and 23 men both before and during treatment). Variables assessed were lesion location (iliac wing adjacent to sacroiliac joint, iliac wing anterior and/or superior to sacroiliac joint, sacrum, and remainder of pelvis), mean lesion attenuation, subjective lesion attenuation (purely sclerotic vs mixed), central versus peripheral lesion sampling, lesion size, core number, and use of zoledronic acid for more than 1 year. Results Of 54 biopsy procedures, 21 (39%) yielded adequate tissue for RNA isolation and genomic profiling. Three of four sacral biopsies were adequate. Biopsies of the ilium adjacent to the sacroiliac joints were more likely adequate than those from elsewhere in the ilium (48% vs 28%, respectively). All five biopsies performed in other pelvic locations yielded inadequate tissue for RNA isolation. Mean attenuation of lesions with inadequate tissue was 172 HU greater than those with adequate tissue (621.1 HU \u00b1 166 vs 449 HU \u00b1 221, respectively; P = .002). Use of zoledronic acid, peripheral sampling, core number, and lesion size affected yields, but the differences were not statistically significant. Histologic examination with hematoxylin-eosin staining showed that results of 36 (67%) biopsies were positive for cancer; only mean attenuation differences were significant (707 HU \u00b1 144 vs 473 HU \u00b1 191, negative vs positive, respectively; P < .001). Conclusion In men with mCRPC, percutaneous sampling of osseous metastases for genomic profiling is possible, but use of zoledronic acid for more than 1 year may reduce the yield of adequate tissue for RNA isolation. Sampling large low-attenuating lesions at their periphery maximizes yield. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "To evaluate the influence of cross-sectional arc calcification on the diagnostic accuracy of computed tomography (CT) angiography compared with conventional coronary angiography for the detection of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD).Institutional Review Board approval and written informed consent were obtained from all centers and participants for this HIPAA-compliant study. Overall, 4511 segments from 371 symptomatic patients (279 men, 92 women; median age, 61 years [interquartile range, 53-67 years]) with clinical suspicion of CAD from the CORE-64 multicenter study were included in the analysis. Two independent blinded observers evaluated the percentage of diameter stenosis and the circumferential extent of calcium (arc calcium). The accuracy of quantitative multidetector CT angiography to depict substantial (\u2265 50%) stenoses was assessed by using quantitative coronary angiography (QCA). Cross-sectional arc calcium was rated on a segment level as follows: noncalcified or mild (< 90\u00b0), moderate (90\u00b0-180\u00b0), or severe (> 180\u00b0) calcification. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression, receiver operation characteristic curve, and clustering methods were used for statistical analyses.A total of 1099 segments had mild calcification, 503 had moderate calcification, 338 had severe calcification, and 2571 segments were noncalcified. Calcified segments were highly associated (P < .001) with disagreement between CTA and QCA in multivariable analysis after controlling for sex, age, heart rate, and image quality. The prevalence of CAD was 5.4% in noncalcified segments, 15.0% in mildly calcified segments, 27.0% in moderately calcified segments, and 43.0% in severely calcified segments. A significant difference was found in area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (noncalcified: 0.86, mildly calcified: 0.85, moderately calcified: 0.82, severely calcified: 0.81; P < .05).In a symptomatic patient population, segment-based coronary artery calcification significantly decreased agreement between multidetector CT angiography and QCA to detect a coronary stenosis of at least 50%.",
        "There is an increasing opportunity to perform multifunctional imaging at a variety of organ sites with relatively short examination times. Each technique yields quantitative parameters that reflect specific aspects of the underlying tumor or tissue biology. Many biomarkers have emerged that provide unique information on tumor behavior, including response to treatment. The multiparametric approach combines the information from different functional imaging techniques; this goes beyond what can be achieved by using any single functional technique, thus allowing an improved understanding of biologic processes and of responses to therapeutic interventions.

        "First, to assess the feasibility of a protocol involving stress-induced perfusion evaluated at computed tomography (CT) combined with cardiac CT angiography in a single examination and second, to assess the incremental value of perfusion imaging over cardiac CT angiography in a dual-source technique for the detection of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) in a high-risk population.Institutional review board approval and informed patient consent were obtained before patient enrollment in the study. The study was HIPAA compliant. Thirty-five patients at high risk for CAD were prospectively enrolled for evaluation of the feasibility of CT perfusion imaging. All patients underwent retrospectively electrocardiographically gated (helical) adenosine stress CT perfusion imaging followed by prospectively electrocardiographically gated (axial) rest myocardial CT perfusion imaging. Analysis was performed in three steps: (a)Coronary arterial stenoses were scored for severity and reader confidence at cardiac CT angiography, (b)myocardial perfusion defects were identified and scored for severity and reversibility at CT perfusion imaging, and (c)coronary stenosis severity was reclassified according to perfusion findings at combined cardiac CT angiography and CT perfusion imaging. The sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV) of cardiac CT angiography before and after CT perfusion analysis were calculated.With use of a reference standard of greater than 50% stenosis at invasive angiography, all parameters of diagnostic accuracy increased after CT perfusion analysis: Sensitivity increased from 83% to 91%; specificity, from 71% to 91%; PPV, from 66% to 86%; and NPV, from 87% to 93%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve increased significantly, from 0.77 to 0.90 (P < .005).A combination protocol involving adenosine perfusion CT imaging and cardiac CT angiography in a dual-source technique is feasible, and CT perfusion adds incremental value to cardiac CT angiography in the detection of significant CAD.",
        "To develop high-spatial-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) microangiography techniques to image the rat ocular circulation.Animal experiments were performed with institutional Animal Care Committee approval. MR microangiography (resolution, 84\u00d784\u00d784 \u03bcm or 42\u00d742\u00d784 \u03bcm) of the rat eye (eight rats) was performed by using a custom-made small circular surface coil with an 11.7-T MR unit before and after monocrystalline iron oxide nanoparticle (MION) injection. MR microangiography measurements were made during air, oxygen, and carbogen inhalation. From three-dimensional MR microangiography, the retina was virtually flattened to enable en face views of various retinal depths, including the retinal and choroidal vascular layers. Signal intensity changes within the retinal or choroidal arteries and veins associated with gas challenges were analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed by using paired t tests, with P<.05 considered to indicate a significant difference. Bonferroni correction was used to adjust for multiple comparisons.The central retinal artery, long posterior ciliary arteries, and choroidal vasculature could be distinguished on MR microangiograms of the eye. With MR microangiography, retinal arteries and veins could be distinguished on the basis of blood oxygen level-dependent contrast. Carbogen inhalation-enhanced MR microangiography signal intensity in both the retina (P=.001) and choroid (P=.027) compared with oxygen inhalation. Carbogen inhalation showed significantly higher signal intensity changes in the retinal arteries (P=.001, compared with oxygen inhalation), but not in the veins (P=.549). With MION administration, MR microangiography depicted retinal arterial vasoconstriction when the animals were breathing oxygen (P=.02, compared with animals breathing air).MR microangiography of the eye allows depth-resolved imaging of small angiographic details of the ocular circulation. This approach may prove useful in studying microvascular pathologic findings and neurovascular dysfunction in the eye and retina.",
        "History A 3-month-old boy presented with new onset of seizure that subsided when he arrived at our institution. There was no reported fever or family history of seizure. Physical examination did not reveal any neurologic abnormalities. Multiple skin lesions of varying sizes were identified on the scalp, trunk, and extremities and were reported to have been present since birth. Laboratory test results were normal. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the brain was performed.",
        "Purpose To investigate longitudinal changes in global and regional brain volume in patients 1 year after mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) and to correlate such changes with clinical and neurocognitive metrics. Materials and Methods This institutional review board\u2013approved study was HIPAA compliant. Twenty-eight patients with MTBI (with 19 followed up at 1 year) with posttraumatic symptoms after injury and 22 matched control subjects (with 12 followed up at 1 year) were enrolled. Automated segmentation of brain regions to compute regional gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volumes was performed by using three-dimensional T1-weighted 3.0-T magnetic resonance imaging, and results were correlated with clinical metrics. Pearson and Spearman rank correlation coefficients were computed between longitudinal brain volume and neurocognitive scores, as well as clinical metrics, over the course of the follow-up period. Results One year after MTBI, there was measurable global brain atrophy, larger than that in control subjects. The anterior cingulate WM bilaterally and the left cingulate gyrus isthmus WM, as well as the right precuneal GM, showed significant decreases in regional volume in patients with MTBI over the 1st year after injury (corrected P < .05); this was confirmed by means of cross-sectional comparison with data in control subjects (corrected P < .05). Left and right rostral anterior cingulum WM volume loss correlated with changes in neurocognitive measures of memory (r = 0.65, P = .005) and attention (r = 0.60, P = .01). At 1-year follow-up, WM volume in the left cingulate gyrus isthmus correlated with clinical scores of anxiety (Spearman rank correlation r = \u22120.68, P = .007) and postconcussive symptoms (Spearman rank correlation r = \u22120.65, P = .01). Conclusion These observations demonstrate structural changes to the brain 1 year after injury after a single concussive episode. Regional brain atrophy is not exclusive to moderate and severe traumatic brain injury but may be seen after mild injury. In particular, the anterior part of the cingulum and the cingulate gyrus isthmus, as well as the precuneal GM, may be distinctively vulnerable 1 year after MTBI. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "To determine whether enhancement at multiphasic multidetector computed tomography (CT) can help differentiate clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) from oncocytoma, papillary RCC, and chromophobe RCC.With institutional review board approval for this HIPAA-compliant retrospective study, the pathology database was queried to derive a cohort of 298 cases of RCC and oncocytoma with preoperative multiphasic multidetector CT with as many as four phases (unenhanced, corticomedullary, nephrographic, and excretory). A total of 170 clear cell RCCs, 57 papillary RCCs, 49 oncocytomas, and 22 chromophobe RCCs were evaluated for multiphasic enhancement and compared by using t tests. Cutoff analysis was performed to determine optimal threshold levels to discriminate among the four groups.Mean enhancement of clear cell RCCs and oncocytomas peaked in the corticomedullary phase; mean enhancement of papillary and chromophobe RCCs peaked in the nephrographic phase. Enhancement of clear cell RCCs was greater than that of oncocytomas in the corticomedullary (125 HU vs 106 HU, P = .045) and excretory (80 HU vs 67 HU, P = .034) phases. Enhancement of clear cell RCCs was greater than that of papillary RCCs in the corticomedullary (125 HU vs 54 HU, P < .001), nephrographic (103 HU vs 64 HU, P < .001), and excretory (80 HU vs 54 HU, P < .001) phases. Enhancement of clear cell RCCs was greater than that of chromophobe RCCs in the corticomedullary (125 HU vs 74 HU, P < .001) and excretory (80 HU vs 60 HU, P = .008) phases. Thresholding of enhancement helped to discriminate clear cell RCC from oncocytoma, papillary RCC, and chromophobe RCC with accuracies of 77% (83 of 108 cases), 85% (101 of 119 cases), and 84% (81 of 97 cases).Enhancement at multiphasic multidetector CT, if prospectively validated, may assist in the discrimination of clear cell RCC from oncocytoma, papillary RCC, and chromophobe RCC.",
        "To determine if a correlation exists between the number of previous enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging examinations and high signal intensity in the globus pallidus (GP) and dentate nucleus (DN) in patients who received gadodiamide (Omniscan), a linear nonionic gadolinium-based contrast agent, and in those who received gadobenate dimeglumine (MultiHance), a linear ionic contrast agent.Institutional review board approval was obtained for this single-center retrospective study, with waiver of informed consent. The study population included 69 patients divided into two groups: Group 1 included patients who underwent gadodiamide-enhanced MR imaging, and group 2 included patients who underwent gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced MR imaging. Two radiologists conducted a quantitative analysis of unenhanced T1-weighted images by using region of interest measurements. The GP-to-thalamus (TH) signal intensity ratio, DN-to-middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP) signal intensity ratio and relative percentage change (Rchange) between the first and last examinations for each patient were calculated. Relation between the signal intensity ratios and Rchange and the number of enhanced MR imaging examinations was analyzed by using a generalized additive model. Inter- and intraobserver agreement was evaluated with the Lin concordance correlation coefficient test.Group 1 included 23 patients (19 female), with a mean of 5.0 doses \u00b1 2.4 (standard deviation) (range, 3-11 doses) administered. Group 2 included 46 patients (24 female) with a mean of 4.6 doses \u00b1 2.2 (range, 3-11 doses) administered. The interval between the first and last examination was 1500.1 days \u00b1 780.2 (range, 98-3097 days) for group 1 and 1086.2 days \u00b1 582.9 (range, 94-2633) for group 2. All patients had normal liver and renal function. Gadodiamide showed a significant increase in DN:MCP and GP:TH (P < .001 for both) and in Rchange (P = .001 for GP:TH, P < .001 for DN:MCP). In group 2, there was no significant increase in DN:MCP or GP:TH over time or in Rchange for GP:TH, but there was a significant trend toward an increase in Rchange for DN:MCP (P = .013). Interobserver agreement was almost perfect (0.99; 95% confidence interval: 0.99, 0.99) for all evaluated structures. Intraobserver agreement was substantial to almost perfect for both readers.A significant increase in GP:TH and DN:MCP is associated with multiple gadodiamide-enhanced studies but not with gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced studies, likely reflecting differences in stability and elimination of both contrast agents. Rate-of-change data indirectly suggest gadolinium deposition in the DN with gadobenate dimeglumine use, although it is considerably less than that with gadodiamide use.",
        "Purpose To assess whether signal intensity (SI) different from that of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the resection cavity during follow-up helps predict tumor progression in partially resected gliomas. Materials and Methods This retrospective study had local institutional review board approval, with waiver of informed consent. Seventy-five patients with partially resected and irradiated gliomas were evaluated. SI within the resection cavity on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance (MR) images was qualitatively and quantitatively assessed during follow-up. Qualitative analysis comprised visual comparison of SI in the resection cavity with SI of normal CSF by two readers. SI of the cavity was quantitatively assessed with region-of-interest (ROI) analysis normalized to background noise, contralateral healthy white matter, and CSF. Normalized SI during follow-up was compared with SI immediately after resection. Tumor progression was defined as increase in longest glioma diameter of at least 20% (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors). Sensitivity and specificity of elevated SI in resection cavities for predicting or indicating tumor progression were calculated. Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Hodges\u2013Lehman estimates, Kaplan\u2013Meier curves, and linear mixed-effect models for repeated-measures data were used for quantitative SI measurements. Results Tumor progression at MR was seen in 44 patients (59%), and median progression-free survival was 4.1 years. Qualitative analysis showed that 25 of 44 patients with progression (57%) had SI increase in the resection cavity on FLAIR images. In 10 patients with progression (23%), SI increase was seen a mean of 5 months \u00b1 3 (standard deviation) before tumor size progression. In 15 patients with progression (34%), SI increase and tumor size progression were detected on the same MR study. In 19 patients with progressing glioma (43%), no SI increase was observed qualitatively. Among 31 patients without progression during follow-up (41%), no SI increase could be observed. Quantitative analysis showed no significant differences in ROI ratios at baseline (after surgery) between progressing and nonprogressing tumors, whereas significant differences in change of ROI ratios at the last measurement could be detected. Overall, SI increase on FLAIR images had specificity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 91%, 100%) and sensitivity of 57% (95% CI: 42%, 71%) for glioma progression. Conclusion In partially resected gliomas, encapsulation of resection cavity, presumably by tumor cells, manifests as SI increase on FLAIR images and indicates tumor progression with very high specificity. \u00a9 RSNA, 2010",
        "To explore any correlation between the number of previous gadolinium-based contrast material administrations and high signal intensity (SI) in the dentate nucleus and globus pallidus on unenhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images.The institutional review board approved this study, waiving the requirement to obtain written informed consent. A group of 381 consecutive patients who had undergone brain MR imaging was identified for cross-sectional analysis. For longitudinal analysis, 19 patients who had undergone at least six contrast-enhanced examinations were compared with 16 patients who had undergone at least six unenhanced examinations. The mean SIs of the dentate nucleus, pons, globus pallidus, and thalamus were measured on unenhanced T1-weighted images. The dentate nucleus-to-pons SI ratio was calculated by dividing the SI in the dentate nucleus by that in the pons, and the globus pallidus-to-thalamus SI ratio was calculated by dividing the SI in the globus pallidus by that in the thalamus. Stepwise regression analysis was undertaken in the consecutive patient group to detect any relationship between the dentate nucleus-to-pons or globus pallidus-to-thalamus SI ratio and previous gadolinium-based contrast material administration or other factors. A random coefficient model was used to evaluate for longitudinal analysis.The dentate nucleus-to-pons SI ratio showed a significant correlation with the number of previous gadolinium-based contrast material administrations (P < .001; regression coefficient, 0.010; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.009, 0.011; standardized regression coefficient, 0.695). The globus pallidus-to-thalamus SI ratio showed a significant correlation with the number of previous gadolinium-based contrast material administrations (P < .001; regression coefficient, 0.004; 95% CI: 0.002, 0.006; standardized regression coefficient, 0.288), radiation therapy (P = .009; regression coefficient, -0.014; 95% CI: -0.025, -0.004; standardized regression coefficient, -0.151), and liver function (P = .031; regression coefficient, 0.023; 95% CI: 0.002, 0.044; standardized regression coefficient, 0.107). The dentate nucleus-to-pons and globus pallidus-to-thalamus SI ratios in patients who had undergone contrast-enhanced examinations were significantly greater than those of patients who had undergone unenhanced examinations (P < .001 for both).High SI in the dentate nucleus and globus pallidus on unenhanced T1-weighted images may be a consequence of the number of previous gadolinium-based contrast material administrations.",
        "To address the frequency of identifying nonsolid nodules, diagnosing lung cancer manifesting as such nodules, and the long-term outcome after treatment in a prospective cohort, the International Early Lung Cancer Action Program.A total of 57,496 participants underwent baseline and subsequent annual repeat computed tomographic (CT) screenings according to an institutional review board, HIPAA-compliant protocol. Informed consent was obtained. The frequency of participants with nonsolid nodules, the course of the nodule at follow-up, and the resulting diagnoses of lung cancer, treatment, and outcome are given separately for baseline and annual repeat rounds of screening. The \u03c7(2) statistic was used to compare percentages.A nonsolid nodule was identified in 2392 (4.2%) of 57,496 baseline screenings, and pathologic pursuit led to the diagnosis of 73 cases of adenocarcinoma. A new nonsolid nodule was identified in 485 (0.7%) of 64,677 annual repeat screenings, and 11 had a diagnosis of stage I adenocarcinoma; none were in nodules 15 mm or larger in diameter. Nonsolid nodules resolved or decreased more frequently in annual repeat than in baseline rounds (322 [66%] of 485 vs 628 [26%] of 2392, P < .0001). Treatment of the cases of lung cancer was with lobectomy in 55, bilobectomy in two, sublobar resection in 26, and radiation therapy in one. Median time to treatment was 19 months (interquartile range [IQR], 6-41 months). A solid component had developed in 22 cases prior to treatment (median transition time from nonsolid to part-solid, 25 months). The lung cancer-survival rate was 100% with median follow-up since diagnosis of 78 months (IQR, 45-122 months).Nonsolid nodules of any size can be safely followed with CT at 12-month intervals to assess transition to part-solid. Surgery was 100% curative in all cases, regardless of the time to treatment.",
        "Purpose To assess the feasibility and accuracy of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT)\u2013guided needle localization for DBT-detected suspicious abnormalities not visualized with other modalities and to analyze the imaging and pathologic characteristics of abnormalities detected only with DBT to determine the positive predictive value for malignancy. Materials and Methods This HIPAA-compliant study was approved by the institutional review board, and the requirement to obtain informed consent was waived. A retrospective query of the imaging database identified 34 consecutive women (average age, 55 years; age range, 28\u201384 years) with 36 lesions who underwent DBT-guided needle localization between April 2011 and January 2013 with use of commercially available equipment. Imaging findings and medical records were reviewed. Findings that were attributable to previous surgical changes were classified as benign or probably benign and excluded from analysis because the lesions did not proceed to localization. Results Architectural distortion was the imaging finding identified in all 36 abnormalities (100%). Findings from pathologic examination after the first attempt at localization were concordant with those from imaging in 35 of the 36 lesions (97%), which is suggestive of appropriate sampling. Histologic findings were malignant in 17 of the 36 lesions (47%; 95% confidence interval: 30.4%, 64.5%). Thirteen of the 17 lesions (76%; 95% confidence interval: 50.1%, 93.1%) were invasive malignancies. Twenty-two of the 36 abnormalities (61%) were either malignant or high-risk lesions (atypical ductal hyperplasia, lobular carcinoma in situ, atypical lobular hyperplasia). Conclusion DBT-guided needle localization is an accurate and feasible method with which to biopsy DBT-detected suspicious architectural distortions not visualized at mammography or sonography. The high risk of malignancy in abnormalities detected only with DBT (47%) confirms that routine biopsy is required for histologic analysis. \u00a9 RSNA, 2015 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To assess the effect of beam hardening on arterial enhancement in thoracoabdominal computed tomographic (CT) angiography in various body sizes in a phantom and in a clinical study.An abdominal aortic phantom was placed in three cylindrical water containers simulating a small, an intermediate, and a large patient (diameters of 22, 30, and 40 cm, respectively). CT scanning was performed at 80, 100, and 120 kVp, and aortic attenuation was assessed. In a HIPAA-compliant institutional review board-approved study with waiver of informed consent, thoracoabdominal aortic attenuation was assessed in 100 consecutive patients (75 men, 25 women; mean body weight (BW), 79 kg) undergoing thoracoabdominal 64-section CT angiography at 80 kVp. Overall aortic attenuation in patients grouped according to BW (small patients [n = 26], <70 kg; intermediate patients [n = 41], 70-85 kg; large patients [n = 33], >85 kg) was compared. Overall aortic attenuation was correlated with BW, height, body mass index (BMI), body surface area (BSA), and lateral diameter by using linear regression.Comparison of the intermediate- and large-phantom groups relative to the small-phantom group indicated that mean aortic attenuation decreased by 9.7% and 13.4% at 80 kVp, 9.8% and 15.1% at 100 kVp, and 13.8% and 23.8% at 120 kVp, respectively (P < .001). In the clinical study, the overall aortic attenuation decreased by 11.3% and 20.0% in the intermediate- and large-patient groups relative to the small-patient group, respectively (P < .05). Overall aortic attenuation correlated well with BSA (R = -0.454), height (R = -0.421), and BW (R = -0.414), followed by lateral diameter (R = -0.291) and BMI (R = -0.211).Beam hardening may substantially contribute to reduced arterial enhancement in larger patients undergoing thoracoabdominal CT angiography. The beam-hardening effect on arterial enhancement is more pronounced at higher tube voltages.",
        "Purpose To prospectively validate predefined breast ultrasonographic (US) Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) category 3 criteria in a multicenter setting in an elevated-risk population. Materials and Methods The American College of Radiology Imaging Network 6666 database was reviewed for prospectively defined BI-RADS category 3 lesions. Patient characteristics, lesion US features at initial detection, and work-up recommendations were analyzed with descriptive statistics. Exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were given, where appropriate. Lesion reference standard was biopsy or a minimum of 1-year follow-up. In addition, malignancy rate for lesions that had at least 2 years of follow-up data or that had biopsy data was calculated. Results Of 2662 participants, 519 (19.5%) had 745 BI-RADS category 3 lesions (25.5% of 2916 US lesions other than simple cysts), with a median size of 7 mm (range, 2\u2013135 mm). The number of new BI-RADS category 3 lesions decreased with year 2\u20133 screening, but the percentage of new BI-RADS category 3 lesions was stable at 26.4% (506 of 1920 lesions), 23.6% (142 of 601 lesions), and 24.6% (97 of 395 lesions), respectively. Of 745 BI-RADS category 3 lesions, 124 (16.6%) were ultimately sampled for biopsy. Six malignancies (0.8% of BI-RADS category 3 lesions; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.3%, 1.7%) occurred in five (1.0%) of 519 participants: Five malignancies were invasive (median size, 10 mm; size range, 2\u201318 mm), and one was node positive. When the analysis is limited to lesions with at least 2-year follow-up or biopsy, the malignancy rate among BI-RADS category 3 lesions is 0.9% (95% CI: 0.3%, 2.0%). Three malignant BI-RADS category 3 lesions were sampled for biopsy because of a suspicious change at follow-up (two N0 lesions, one each at 6- and 12-month follow-up; one N1 lesion at 24-month follow-up), one was sampled for biopsy because of an upgrade after additional mammography (NX), one was found at mastectomy for another cancer (N0), and one was found at prophylactic contralateral mastectomy in the same patient (NX). Conclusion As BI-RADS category 3 lesions have a low malignancy rate (0.8%; 95% CI: 0.3%, 1.7%) and only 0.1% of the cancers had suspicious changes at 6-month follow-up and only one (17%; 95% CI: 0.4%, 64%) of six malignancies were node positive at detection (24-month follow-up), a recommendation of 1-year diagnostic follow-up may be appropriate for BI-RADS category 3 lesions detected at screening US. \u00a9RSNA, 2013 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To evaluate a technique to perform fluoroscopically directed thoracic transforaminal epidural injections.Institutional review board approval and a waiver of consent were obtained for this retrospective HIPAA-compliant study. Findings from 198 consecutively performed foraminal nerve blocks and foraminal epidural injections in the thoracic spine from June 27, 1997 to December 29, 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. This study was designed to evaluate a current technique and the experience with an approach that improves safety by decreasing the chance of inadvertent injury to nontargeted structures. Fluoroscopic spot views retained as part of a quality assurance program were available in all patients for review.By utilizing this technique, there was a single delayed pneumothorax that occurred because of deviation from the accepted technique. No other major complications occurred (which the authors defined as death, neurovascular injury, pneumothorax, and infection). Inadvertent puncture of the dura did not occur. Minor complications included vasovagal response and transient pain during the administration of injectate, which were resolved by the termination of the procedure. The ease of identifying the ribs fluoroscopically and utilizing the rib as a conduit into the foramen provided an advantage in patients with osteopenia, severe osteoarthritis, and scoliosis compared with previously described techniques.This study evaluated an innovative technique to perform fluoroscopically directed thoracic intraforaminal nerve blocks that showed few complications and anatomically avoided transgression of structures in the posterior mediastinum.",
        "To determine if the combination of gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging helps to increase accuracy and sensitivity in the diagnosis of small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) compared with those achieved by using each MR imaging technique alone.The institutional review board approved this retrospective study and waived the requirement for informed consent. The study included 130 patients (95 men, 35 women) with 179 surgically confirmed small HCCs (\u22642.0 cm) and 130 patients with cirrhosis (90 men, 40 women) without HCC who underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging and DW imaging at 3.0 T between May 2009 and July 2010. Three sets of images were analyzed independently by three observers to detect HCC: a gadoxetic acid set (unenhanced, early dynamic, and hepatobiliary phases), a DW imaging set, and a combined set. Data were analyzed by using alternative-free response receiver operating characteristic analysis. Diagnostic accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [A(z)]), sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value were calculated.The mean A(z) values for the combined set (0.952) were significantly higher than those for the gadoxetic acid set (A(z) = 0.902) or the DW imaging set alone (A(z) = 0.871) (P \u2264 .008). On a per-lesion basis, observers showed higher sensitivity in their analyses of the combined set (range, 91.1%-93.3% [163-167 of 179]) than in those of the gadoxetic acid set (range, 80.5%-82.1% [144-147 of 179]) or the DW imaging set alone (range, 77.7%-79.9% [139-143 of 179]) (P \u2264 .003). Positive predictive values and specificity for all observers were equivalent for the three imaging sets.The combination of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging and DW imaging yielded better diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity in the detection of small HCCs than each MR imaging technique alone.",
        "To assess the performance of an artificial neural network in the evaluation of fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the liver, compared with the results of expert interpretation of abdominal liver magnetic resonance (MR) images.The study was approved by the institutional human research committee and was HIPAA compliant, with waiver of informed consent. Digital data from positron emission tomographic (PET)/computed tomographic (CT) examinations, along with patient demographics, were obtained from 98 consecutive patients who underwent both whole-body PET/CT examinations and liver MR imaging examinations within 2 months. Interpretations of the scans from PET/CT examinations by trained neural networks were cross-classified with expert interpretations of the findings on images from MR examinations for intrahepatic benignity or malignancy. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were obtained for the designed networks. The significance of the difference between neural network ROC curves and the ROC curves detailing the performance of two expert blinded observers in the interpretation of liver FDG uptake was determined.A neural network incorporating lesion data demonstrated an ROC curve with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.905 (standard error, 0.0370). A network independent of lesion data demonstrated an ROC curve with an AUC of 0.896 (standard error, 0.0386). These results compare favorably with results of expert blinded observers 1 and 2 who demonstrated ROCs with AUCs of 0.786 (standard error, 0.0522) and 0.796 (standard error, 0.0514), respectively. Following unblinding to network data, the AUCs for readers 1 and 2 improved to 0.924 (standard error, 0.0335) and 0.881 (standard error, 0.0409), respectively.Computers running artificial neural networks employing PET/CT scan data are sensitive and specific in the designation of the presence of intrahepatic malignancy, with comparison with interpretation by expert observers. When used in conjunction with human expertise, network data improve accuracy of the human interpreter.",
        "To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of antegrade renal cooling during radiofrequency (RF) ablation to protect the renal collecting system in pigs.With the approval of the institutional animal care and use committee, RF ablation was planned bilaterally after nephrostomy in 20 kidneys from 10 domestic pigs. A coaxial assembly consisting of a 7-F pigtail catheter and a 12-F arterial sheath was placed at the renal pelvis. Cooled 5% dextrose in water solution was perfused in only one of the kidneys in each pig. A 17-gauge internally cooled tip RF electrode with a 3-cm tip was placed near the renal pelvis with ultrasonographic guidance. On postprocedural days 1 and 7, computed tomography (CT) was performed to evaluate the RF ablation effect, the presence of a fluid collection, and the leakage of contrast material. Ex vivo retrograde pyelography was performed to assess the integrity of the urinary tract after kidney harvest. Histologic findings related to the urothelial damage were scored semiquantitatively.The mean maximal diameter of the RF ablation area measured at CT and in specimens was not significantly different between cooled and noncooled kidneys. A fluid collection around the RF ablation area was seen in eight of the 10 noncooled kidneys on day 7 CT scans compared with two of the 10 cooled kidneys; the difference was statistically significant (P = .035). Ex vivo retrograde pyelography depicted leakage of contrast material in only the noncooled group. The mean histologic damage score was lower in the cooled group than in the noncooled group.RF ablation after placement of an antegrade cooling system in pig kidneys was feasible. Antegrade cold dextrose infusion of the urinary tract during RF ablation is effective in protecting the renal collecting system without compromising the RF ablation effect.",
        "Purpose To determine the effect of more than 20 serial injections of macrocyclic gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) on the signal intensity (SI) of the dentate nucleus (DN) on unenhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images. Materials and Methods In this retrospective, institutional review board-approved study, 33 patients who underwent at least 20 consecutive MR imaging examinations (plus an additional MR imaging for reference) with the exclusive use of macrocyclic GBCAs gadoterate meglumine and gadobutrol were analyzed. SI ratio differences were calculated for DN-to-pons and DN-to-middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP) ratios by subtracting the SI ratio at the first MR imaging examination from the SI ratio at the last MR imaging examination. One-sample t tests were used to examine if the SI ratio differences differed from 0, and Bayes factors were calculated to quantify the strength of evidence for each test. Results Patients underwent a mean of 23.03 \u00b1 (standard deviation) 4.20 GBCA administrations (mean accumulated dose, 491.21 mL \u00b1 87.04 of a 0.5 M GBCA solution) with an average of 12.09 weeks \u00b1 2.16 between every administration. Both ratio differences did not differ significantly from 0 (DN-to-pons ratio: -0.0032 \u00b1 0.0154, P = .248; DN-to-MCP ratio: -0.0011 \u00b1 0.0093, P = .521), and one-sided Bayes factors provided substantial to strong evidence against an SI ratio increase (Bayes factor for DN-to-pons ratio = 0.09 and that for DN-to-MCP ratio = 0.12). Conclusion The study indicates that 20 or more serial injections of macrocyclic GBCAs administered with on average 3 months between each injection are not associated with an SI increase in the DN. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016.",
        "To determine the variability of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values in various anatomic regions in the upper abdomen measured with magnetic resonance (MR) systems from different vendors and with different field strengths.Ten healthy men (mean age, 36.6 years \u00b1 7.7 [standard deviation]) gave written informed consent to participate in this prospective ethics committee-approved study. Diffusion-weighted (DW) MR imaging was performed in each subject with 1.5- and 3.0-T MR systems from each of three vendors at two institutions. Two readers independently measured ADC values in seven upper abdominal regions (left and right liver lobe, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and renal cortex and medulla). ADC values were tested for interobserver differences, as well as for differences related to field strength and vendor, with repeated-measures analysis of variance; coefficients of variation (CVs) and variance components were calculated.Interreader agreement was excellent (intraclass coefficient, 0.876). ADC values were (77.5-88.8) \u00d710(-5) mm(2)/sec in the spleen and (250.6-278.5) \u00d710(-5) mm(2)/sec in the gallbladder. There were no significant differences between ADC values measured at 1.5 T and those measured at 3.0 T in any anatomic region (P >.10 for all). In two of seven regions at 1.5 T (left and right liver lobes, P < .023) and in four of seven regions at 3.0 T (left liver lobe, pancreas, and renal cortex and medulla, P < .008), intervendor differences were significant. CVs ranged from 7.0% to 27.1% depending on the anatomic location.Despite significant intervendor differences in ADC values of various anatomic regions of the upper abdomen, ADC values of the gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and kidney may be comparable between MR systems from different vendors and between different field strengths.",
        "To identify the most appropriate magnetic resonance (MR) sequence for breast biopsy with regard to lesion visibility and artifact size and to assess feasibility and safety of this approach in a clinical setting.MR-guided interventions were performed in an open 1.0-T MR imager between November 2009 and January 2011. The prospective clinical study was approved by the institutional review board. Written informed consent was obtained. Four different fast dynamic sequences (balanced steady-state free precession, T1-weighted turbo gradient-echo, T1-weighted turbo spin-echo [SE], and T2-weighted single-shot SE sequences) were evaluated for artifact size of biopsy needle and in vivo for lesion visibility. In vivo breast biopsies were performed with the freehand technique and without immobilization or a positioning device by using an interactive MR mode that allowed continuous imaging in two orthogonal planes for guidance.On the basis of good lesion detection in combination with small artifact size, T1-weighted SE imaging was used for biopsy. A total of 75 biopsies were performed successfully in 69 patients (mean age, 53 years; age range, 35-78 years) (mean lesion size, 7.1 mm; range, 4-15 mm). The interactive MR platform enabled immediate localization and correction of intended needle trajectory. Average time for freehand biopsy was 12 minutes (range, 8-23 minutes). No major complications were recorded.MR-guided freehand biopsy of breast lesions with the near-real-time interactive MR platform in an open 1.0-T MR imager is safe and feasible in a clinical setting. The method simplifies work flow and intervention performance.",
        "Purpose To assess the diagnostic accuracy, image quality, and radiation dose of an iterative reconstruction algorithm compared with a filtered back projection (FBP) algorithm for abdominal computed tomography (CT) at different tube voltages. Materials and Methods A custom liver phantom with 45 simulated hypovascular liver tumors (diameters of 5, 10, and 15 mm; tumor-to-liver contrast of 10, 25, and 50 HU) was placed in a cylindrical water container that mimicked an intermediate-sized patient. The phantom was scanned at 120, 100, and 80 kVp. The CT data sets were reconstructed with FBP and iterative reconstruction. The image noise was measured, and the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the tumors was calculated. The radiation dose was assessed with the volume CT dose index. Tumor detection was independently performed by three radiologists. Statistical analysis included analysis of variance. Results Compared with the FBP data set at 120 kVp, the iterative reconstruction data set collected at 100 kVp demonstrated significantly lower mean image noise (20.9 and 16.7 HU, respectively; P < .001) and greater mean CNRs for the simulated tumors (P < .001). The iterative reconstruction data set collected at 120 kVp yielded the highest sensitivity for tumor detection, while the FBP data set at 80 kVp yielded the lowest. The sensitivity for the iterative reconstruction data set at 100 kVp was comparable with that for the FBP data set at 120 kVp (79.3% and 74.9%, respectively; P > .99). The volume CT dose index decreased by 39.8% between the 120-kVp protocol and the 100-kVp protocol and by 70.3% between the 120-kVp protocol and the 80-kVp protocol. Conclusion Results of this phantom study suggest that a 100-kVp abdominal CT protocol with an iterative reconstruction algorithm for simulated intermediate-sized patients increases the image quality and maintains the diagnostic accuracy at a reduced radiation dose when compared with a 120-kVp protocol with an FBP algorithm. \u00a9 RSNA, 2011 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.11102217/-/DC1",
        "To compare the antiquated x-ray system of Hoffmans and van Kleef (circa 1896) with modern x-ray equipment in terms of radiation dose, x-ray beam properties, image quality, and electrical parameters.The antiquated x-ray system consisted of a Ruhmkorff inductor, battery, and Crookes tube. The radiation dose rate, x-ray beam properties, and electrical characteristics of this system were determined. A modern computed radiography plate was used to compare images of a hand specimen obtained by using the antiquated system with images obtained by using the modern system.A peak voltage of 73 kV was obtained with an 8-V battery. With Crookes tube number 9, the half-value layer of the generated x-rays was 0.56 mm Al. Pinhole images showed that the x-rays originated from an extended area of the glass wall, causing image blurring. When measured on the skin of a hand specimen, the radiation dose of the antiquated system was about 10 times greater than that of the modern system for the same detector signal. The estimated skin dose was about 74 mGy for the antiquated system and 0.05 mGy for the modern system. The corresponding exposure times were 90 minutes and 21 msec.Radiation dose and exposure time of the antiquated system were greater than those of the modern system by about three and five orders of magnitude, respectively. Images of the hand specimen obtained with the antiquated system were severely blurred but were still awe inspiring, considering the simplicity of the system.http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.11101899/-/DC1.",
        "Purpose To assess whether an association exists between hyperintensity in the dentate nucleus (DN) on unenhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images and previous administration of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) that contain different types of gadolinium chelates. Materials and Methods The institutional review board approved this study. Written informed consent was waived because this was a retrospective study. Evaluated were 127 cases among 360 consecutive patients who underwent contrast agent\u2013enhanced brain MR imaging. Two radiologists conducted visual evaluation and quantitative analysis on unenhanced T1-weighted MR images by using regions of interest. DN-to-cerebellum (DN/cerebellum) signal intensity ratios were calculated and the relationship between DN/cerebellum and several factors was evaluated, including the number of previous linear chelate and/or macrocyclic GBCA administrations by using a generalized additive model. The Akaike information criterion was used in model selection. Interobserver correlation was evaluated with paired t tests and the Lin concordance correlation coefficient. Results The images of nine patients (7.1%) showed hyperintensity in the DN. Twenty-three patients (18.1%) received linear GBCAs (median, two patients; maximum, 11 patients), 36 patients (28.3%) received macrocyclic GBCAs (median, two patients; maximum, 15 patients), 14 patients (11.0%) received both types of GBCA (linear [median, two patients; maximum, five patients] and macrocyclic [median, three patients; maximum, eight patients]), and 54 patients (42.5%) had no history of administration of gadolinium chelate. Interobserver correlation was almost perfect (0.992 [95% confidence interval: 0.990, 0.994]). The DN/cerebellum ratio was associated with linear GBCA (P < .001), but not with macrocyclic GBCA exposure (P = .875). According to the Akaike information criterion, only linear GBCA was selected for the final model, and the DN/cerebellum ratio had strong association only with linear GBCA. Conclusion Hyperintensity in the DN on unenhanced T1-weighted MR images is associated with previous administration of linear GBCA, while the previous administration of macrocyclic GBCAs showed no such association. \u00a9 RSNA, 2015",
        "Purpose To assess the prevalence and number of cortical microinfarcts in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) by using a 7-T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging system, to assess the independent association of cortical microinfarcts with cognitive dysfunction, and to investigate potential confounding effects of the coexisting presence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Materials and Methods The local institutional review board approved this study. In all cases, informed consent was obtained. High-spatial-resolution fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and T2*-weighted images were acquired in 14 AD patients and 18 control subjects to assess the presence of microinfarcts and microbleeds. Presence of CAA was assessed according to the Boston criteria. Image analysis was performed independently by two reviewers. Mann-Whitney U test was performed to assess differences in number of microinfarcts between groups. Negative binomial regression models were used to assess the association between diagnosis of AD and diagnosis of CAA and number of microinfarcts, between diagnosis of AD and number of microbleeds and number of microinfarcts, and between cognitive function and number of microinfarcts, all corrected for age and sex. Results Interobserver agreement was excellent for detecting microinfarcts (\u03ba = 0.91) (P < .001). Patients with AD demonstrated higher number (P = .005) of microinfarcts (mean, 7.2) compared with control subjects (mean, 1.8). Negative binomial regression models showed an independent association between AD and number of microinfarcts (P = .006) and a trend for CAA and microinfarcts (P = .052). A negative correlation was found between cognitive function and the number of microinfarcts (P = .009). Conclusion Patients with AD show more microinfarcts than do control subjects, the number of microinfarcts correlates with global cognitive performance, and the presence of microinfarcts was mainly AD rather than CAA related. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "To evaluate the diagnostic performance of gray-scale ultrasonography (US) and elastography in differentiating benign and malignant thyroid nodules.This was an institutional review board-approved retrospective study with waiver of informed consent. A total of 703 solid thyroid nodules in 676 patients (mean age, 49.7 years; range, 18-79 years) were included; there were 556 women (mean age, 49.5 years; range, 20-74 years) and 120 men (mean age, 50.7 years; range, 18-79 years). Nodules with marked hypoechogenicity, poorly defined margins, microcalcifications, and a taller-than-wide shape were classified as suspicious at grayscale US. Findings at elastography were classified according to the Rago criteria and the Asteria criteria. The diagnostic performances of gray-scale US and elastography were compared. For comparison between the diagnostic performances of gray-scale US and the combination of gray-scale US and elastography, three sets of criteria were assigned: criteria set 1, nodules with any suspicious grayscale US feature were assessed as suspicious; criteria set 2, Rago criteria were added as suspicious features to criteria set 1; and criteria set 3, Asteria criteria were added as suspicious features to criteria set 1. The diagnostic performances of gray-scale US, elastography with Rago criteria, and elastography with Asteria criteria, and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals for predicting thyroid malignancy were compared using generalized estimating equation analysis.Of 703 nodules, 217 were malignant and 486 were benign. Sensitivity, negative predictive value (NPV), and OR of gray-scale US for the 703 nodules were 91.7%, 94.7%, and 22.1, respectively, and these values were higher than the 15.7% and 65.4% sensitivity, 71.7% and 79.1% NPV, and 3.7 and 2.6 ORs found for elastography with Rago and Asteria criteria, respectively. Specificity, positive predictive value, and accuracy for criteria set 1 were significantly higher than those for criteria sets 2 and 3 for most of the nodule subgroups that were considered.Elastography alone, as well as the combination of elastography and gray-scale US, showed inferior performance in the differentiation of malignant and benign thyroid nodules compared with gray-scale US features; elastography was not a useful tool in recommending fine-needle aspiration biopsy.",
        "Background: The prevalence of low back pain in Nigeria is comparable to what obtains in industrialized countries, where it is recorded as affecting more than 80% of the populace in their lifetime and accounting for a mean of 3 days off work per person per year.1 Although numerous modalities are available, Magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI) has emerged as the procedure of choice for the diagnostic imaging of the lumbar spine, due to its imaging characteristics which allow examiners to observe lumbar anatomy in precise detail and detect morphologic and biochemical abnormalities that were not observable previously. These include its excellent spatial resolution, high degree of soft tissue contrast, multiaxial, and multiplanar imaging, lack of ionising radiation with no known biohazard effects. The study is done to determine the pattern, prevalence and probable cause of low back pain in adults and to compare the results with those of previous studies.\r\nMethodology: 250 patients who had MR imaging of lumbar spine performed during a 12-month period (June 2008 \u2013 May 2009) were reviewed. SIEMENS MAGNETOM CONCERTO (MR 2004A), an open magnet of 0.2TESLA strength was used to obtain images. The studies consisted of five spin echo sequences: coronal, sagittal and axial localizers with a repetition time and echo time (TR/TE) of 25/10 msec; field of view(FOV) of 40cm, matrix 128x256; sagittal view with a TR/TE of 500/19 msec; FOV of 31cm, matrix 358x512; axial view with a TR/TE of 600-1100/25 msec, FOV of 21cm, matrix 288x512; sagittal view with a TR/TE of 3970/127 msec; FOV of 32cm, matrix 358x512; axial view with a TR/TE of 5000-6000/103 msec, FOV of 26 - 28cm, matrix 338x512. Flip angles of 900 and 1800 for T1 and T2 and a slice thickness of 4 mm with a 1mm gap was used for all sequences. With the patients supine, radiofrequency surface coils were placed over the patients to cover the lumbar spine (areas between the costophrenic angle and the iliac crest47) and the laser beam aligned on patients at the centering point (between L1 and L3). The table was then moved under the magnet until the patients were at the isocentre of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe magnet and the images acquired. Disc contour, disc space narrowing/height, nerve root compression, central spinal stenosis, bony destruction, bone marrow changes/Modic changes, spondylolysis/spondylolisthesis and the presence of paravertebral or paraspinal soft tissue masses; correlation between age and number of degenerated discs were all assessed.\r\nResults: MR images of 250 patients whose ages ranged from 21 to 81 years (mean 53.27 years); 106 female (42.4%) and 144 males (57.6%) were reviewed. Their cases were divided into 7 ranges by their ages. Most patients were in the 51-60age range (23.6%) and the least in the extremes of the age ranges. Commonest clinical finding was idiopathic back pain; Majority (88.8%) had mechanical low back pain which comprises degenerative, idiopathic and congenital abnormalities; while 11.2% had non-mechanical back pain comprising infections and tumors. The commonest diagnoses in both genders and in all the age ranges except the 21-30 year age range was intervertebral osteochondrosis. The L4/L5 disc level was the most commonly affected and the number of degenerated discs increased with age.\r\nConclusion: Mechanical low back pain, of which intervertebral osteochondrosis accounts for the highest percentage, is the most common cause of low back pain in our environment.KEY WORDS: MRI, LUMBAR SPINE, LOW BACK PAIN, ADULTS",
        "To quantitatively compare the potential of various diffusion parameters obtained from monoexponential, biexponential, and stretched exponential diffusion-weighted imaging models and diffusion kurtosis imaging in the grading of gliomas.This study was approved by the local ethics committee, and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Both diffusion-weighted imaging and diffusion kurtosis imaging were performed in 69 patients with pathologically proven gliomas by using a 3-T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging unit. An isotropic apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), true ADC, pseudo-ADC, and perfusion fraction were calculated from diffusion-weighted images by using a biexponential model. A water molecular diffusion heterogeneity index and distributed diffusion coefficient were calculated from diffusion-weighted images by using a stretched exponential model. Mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy, and mean kurtosis were calculated from diffusion kurtosis images. All values were compared between high-grade and low-grade gliomas by using a Mann-Whitney U test. Receiver operating characteristic and Spearman rank correlation analysis were used for statistical evaluations.ADC, true ADC, perfusion fraction, water molecular diffusion heterogeneity index, distributed diffusion coefficient, and mean diffusivity values were significantly lower in high-grade gliomas than in low-grade gliomas (U = 109, 56, 129, 6, 206, and 229, respectively; P < .05). Pseudo-ADC and mean kurtosis values were significantly higher in high-grade gliomas than in low-grade gliomas (U = 98 and 8, respectively; P < .05). Both water molecular diffusion heterogeneity index (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.993) and mean kurtosis (AUC = 0.991) had significantly greater AUC values than ADC (AUC = 0.866), mean diffusivity (AUC = 0.722), and fractional anisotropy (AUC = 0.500) in the differentiation of low-grade and high-grade gliomas (P < .05).Water molecular diffusion heterogeneity index and mean kurtosis values may provide additional information and improve the grading of gliomas compared with conventional diffusion parameters.",
        "Background: Renal volume at sonography theoretically reflects the functional capacity of\r\nthe kidney which could be equivalent to glomerular filtration rate. The increasing burden of chronic renal diseases is alarming and has assumed epidemic proportions in resource poor settings, especially Africa, Nigeria included; consequently, efforts to reduce the cost of detecting, monitoring and managing chronic renal disease are imperative. Hence, ultrasonography provides a reliable, reproducible, cost-effective and readily accessible method of evaluating renal status. This was the thrust of this study, which sought to investigate the relationship between sonographically determined renal volume and functional capacity of the kidney represented by the estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR).\r\nAims and objectives: To determine the relationship between sonographic renal volume and renal function as assessed by the estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) as well as the relationship between sonographic renal volume and anthropometric measurements in normal adult population in Calabar.\r\nMethodology: A cross sectional prospective study design was employed, with recruitment of healthy subjects visiting or working in the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital using the simple random sampling method. Following researcher-administration of structured questionnaire with the inclusion and exclusion criteria adhered to; anthropometric data was obtained. Point of care serum creatinine values were obtained and utilized for estimation of GFR using Cockcroft Gault (CG) equation. Renal ultrasonography was then done for each of the consenting subjects.\r\nResults: Data was obtained from hundred (400) subjects with a female: male ratio of 1: 0.65, and mean age of 35.2 \u00b1 10.5 years, ranging from 18-80 years.

The renal dimensions were generally larger in males than females.\r\nConclusion: This study shows a positive relationship between renal volume and eGFR ,body weight and BMI with implication for diagnostic and prognostic renal evaluation in our environment, especially for Nigerian adults living in the south south region.Keywords: Chronic renal disease, renal volume, Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate, Ultrasonography",
        "History A 61-year-old woman with well-controlled diabetes presented with a 10-year history of hypertension, stifling sensation, and flushing. Her body mass index was 19.1 kg/m(2) (normal range, 18.5-25.0 kg/m(2)). She was being followed up for mild hypercalcemia (calcium level, 10.8 mg/dL [2.7 mmol/L]) (normal range, 8.5-10.5 mg/dL [2.12-2.62 mmol/L]) by the endocrinologist (S.J.M.), who decided to perform a technetium 99m sestamibi ((99m)Tc MIBI) parathyroid scan. The test showed an abnormal tracer deposit in the region of the clavicle and sternum; thus, unenhanced thoracic computed tomography (CT) was performed. No mass was seen in the region of abnormality. In light of these findings, the patient underwent contrast material-enhanced (120 mL of iopromide, Ultravist 300; Schering, Berlin, Germany) thoracic abdominopelvic CT. There was no history of underlying malignancy, and the complete blood counts were normal. The axial and appendicular skeleton showed no sign of lesions.",
        "To retrospectively investigate the value of computerized three-dimensional texture analysis for differentiation of preinvasive lesions from invasive pulmonary adenocarcinomas (IPAs) that manifest as part-solid ground-glass nodules (GGNs).The institutional review board approved this retrospective study with a waiver of patients' informed consent. The study consisted of 86 patients with 86 pathologic analysis-confirmed part-solid GGNs (mean size, 16 mm \u00b1 5.4 [standard deviation]) who had undergone computed tomographic (CT) imaging between January 2005 and October 2011. Each part-solid GGN was manually segmented and its computerized texture features were quantitatively extracted by using an in-house software program. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the differentiating factors of preinvasive lesions from IPAs. Three-layered artificial neural networks (ANNs) with a back-propagation algorithm and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were used to build a discriminating model with texture features and to evaluate its discriminating performance.Pathologic analysis confirmed 58 IPAs (seven minimally invasive adenocarcinomas and 51 invasive adenocarcinomas) and 28 preinvasive lesions (four atypical adenomatous hyperplasias and 24 adenocarcinomas in situ). IPAs and preinvasive lesions exhibited significant differences in various histograms and volumetric parameters (P < .05). Multivariate analysis revealed that smaller mass (adjusted odds ratio, 0.092) and higher kurtosis (adjusted odds ratio, 3.319) are significant differentiators of preinvasive lesions from IPAs (P < .05). With mean attenuation, standard deviation of attenuation, mass, kurtosis, and entropy, the ANNs model showed excellent accuracy in differentiation of preinvasive lesions from IPAs (area under the curve, 0.981).In part-solid GGNs, higher kurtosis and smaller mass are significant differentiators of preinvasive lesions from IPAs, and preinvasive lesions can be accurately differentiated from IPAs by using computerized texture analysis.

        "Purpose To characterize the relationship between aneurysm size and epidemiologic risk factors with growth and rupture by using computed tomographic (CT) angiography. Materials and Methods In this HIPAA-compliant, institutional review board approved study, patients with known asymptomatic unruptured intracerebral aneurysms were followed up longitudinally with CT angiographic examinations. Growth was defined as an increase in one or more dimensions above the measurement error, and at least 5% volume by using the ABC/2 method. Associations of epidemiologic factors with aneurysm growth and rupture were analyzed by using logistic regression analysis. Intra- and interobserver agreement coefficients for dimension, volume, and growth were evaluated by using the Pearson correlation coefficient and difference of means with 95% confidence intervals, the agreement statistic, and the McNemar \u03c72. Results Patients (n = 165) with aneurysms (n = 258) had a mean follow-up time of 2.24 years from time of diagnosis. Forty-six of 258 (18%) aneurysms in 38 patients grew larger. Spontaneous rupture occurred in four of 228 (1.8%) intradural aneurysms of average size (6.2 mm). Risk of aneurysm rupture per patient-year was 2.4% (95% CI: 0.5%, 7.12%) with growth and 0.2% (95% CI: 0.006%, 1.22%) without growth (P = .034). There was a 12-fold higher risk of rupture for growing aneurysms (P < .002), with high intra- and interobserver correlation coefficients for size, volume, and growth. Tobacco smoking (3.806, one degree of freedom; P < .015,) and initial size (5.895, two degrees of freedom; P < .051) were independent covariates, predicting 78.4% of growing aneurysms. Conclusion These results support imaging follow-up of all patients with aneurysms, including those whose aneurysms are smaller than the current 7-mm treatment threshold. Aneurysm growth, size, and smoking were associated with increased rupture risk. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "To perform a radiogenomic analysis of women with breast cancer to study the multiscale relationships among quantitative computer vision-extracted dynamic contrast material-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging phenotypes, early metastasis, and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) expression determined by means of high-resolution next-generation RNA sequencing.In this institutional review board-approved study, an automated image analysis platform extracted 47 computational quantitative features from DCE MR imaging data in a training set (n = 19) to screen for MR imaging biomarkers indicative of poor metastasis-free survival (MFS). The lncRNA molecular landscape of the candidate feature was defined by using an RNA sequencing-specific negative binomial distribution differential expression analysis. Then, this radiogenomic biomarker was applied prospectively to a validation set (n = 42) to allow prediction of MFS and lncRNA expression by using quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis.The quantitative MR imaging feature, enhancing rim fraction score, was predictive of MFS in the training set (P = .007). RNA sequencing analysis yielded an average of 55.7 \u00d7 10(6) reads per sample and identified 14 880 lncRNAs from a background of 189 883 transcripts per sample. Radiogenomic analysis allowed identification of three previously uncharacterized and five named lncRNAs significantly associated with high enhancing rim fraction, including Homeobox transcript antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR) (P < .05), a known predictor of poor MFS in patients with breast cancer. Independent validation confirmed the association of the enhancing rim fraction phenotype with both MFS (P = .002) and expression of four of the top five differentially expressed lncRNAs (P < .05), including HOTAIR.The enhancing rim fraction score, a quantitative DCE MR imaging lncRNA radiogenomic biomarker, is associated with early metastasis and expression of the known predictor of metastatic progression, HOTAIR.",
        "The American Board of Radiology (ABR) has provided certification for diagnostic radiologists and other specialists and subspecialists for more than 75 years. The Board certification process is a tangible expression of the social contract between the profession and the public by which the profession enjoys the privilege of self-regulation and the public is assured that it can expect medical professionals to put patients' interests first, guarantees the competence of practitioners, and guards the public health. A primary tool used by the ABR in fulfilling this responsibility is the secure proctored examination. This article sets forth seven standards based on authoritative sources in the field of psychometrics (the science of mental measurements), and explains in each case how the ABR implements that standard. Readers are encouraged to understand that, despite the multiple opinions that may be held, these standards developed over decades by experts using the scientific method should be the central feature in any discussion or critique of examinations given for the privilege of professional practice and for safeguarding the public well-being. \u00a9 American Board of Radiology, 2013",
        "A 77-year-old woman presented with pain in the right elbow of several years duration. There was no history of trauma, immunocompromise, or known malignancy. Blood chemistry tests revealed an alkaline phosphatase level of 93 U/L (1.6 \u03bckat/L) (30-120 U/L [0.5-2.0 \u03bckat/L]), a sodium level of 139 mmol/L (135-147 mmol/L), a potassium level of 4.4 mmol/L (3.4-5.0 mmol/L), a calcium level of 2.38 mmol/L (2.2-2.55 mmol/L), a phosphate level of 1.81 mmol/L (0.85-1.5 mmol/L), a C-reactive protein level of less than 5 mg/L (47.6 nmol/L), and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 41 mm/h (0-15 mm/h). Hematologic findings were normal. Imaging included plain film radiography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the right humerus. Bone biopsies were obtained 3 months and 4 years after initial presentation.",
        "Purpose To evaluate quantitative perfusion measurements of dynamic indocyanine green (ICG)\u2013enhanced optical imaging for monitoring synovitis in the hands of patients with inflammatory arthritis compared with dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and clinical outcome. Materials and Methods This study was approved by the ethics committee at the institution. Individual joints (n = 840) in the hands and wrists of 28 patients (14 women; mean age, 53.3 years) with inflammatory arthritis were examined at three different time points: before start of therapy and 12 and 24 weeks after start of therapy or therapy escalation. Treatment response was assessed by using clinical measures (simple disease activity index [SDAI]), ICG-enhanced optical imaging, and DCE MR imaging. Dynamic images were obtained for optical imaging and DCE MR imaging. The rate of early enhancement (REE) of the perfusion curves of each joint was calculated by using in-house developed software. Correlation coefficients were estimated to evaluate the associations of changes of imaging parameters and SDAI change. Results Quantitative perfusion measurements with optical imaging and MR imaging correctly identified patients who responded (n = 18) and did not respond to therapy (n = 10), as determined by SDAI. The difference of REE after 24 weeks of treatment compared with baseline in responders was significantly reduced in optical imaging and MR imaging (optical imaging: mean, \u221221.5%; MR imaging: mean, \u221241.0%; P < .001 for both), while in nonresponders it was increased (optical imaging: mean, 10.8%; P = .075; MR imaging: mean, 8.7%; P = .03). The REE of optical imaging significantly correlated with MR imaging (\u03c1 = 0.80; P < .001) and SDAI (\u03c1 = 0.61; P < .001). Conclusion Quantitative analysis of contrast-enhanced optical imaging allows for potential therapeutic monitoring of synovitis in patients with inflammatory arthritis. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To investigate whether the presence of myocardial infarction (MI) detected with late gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is an independent predictor of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) in patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and those with overt diabetes mellitus (DM).Institutional review board approval was obtained for this study, and all subjects provided written informed consent. Late gadolinium-enhanced and cine MR imaging were performed in 190 patients with IFG and 160 patients with DM without known previous MI to evaluate the presence and extent of late gadolinium enhancement as well as global and regional left ventricular function. MACEs were defined as cardiac death, MI, unstable angina, heart failure, and ventricular arrhythmia. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to investigate the relationship between clinical and MR imaging variables and MACEs.Follow-up information was obtained in 181 of the 190 patients with IFG (95%) and 151 of the 160 patients with DM (94%). MACEs were observed in 15 of the 181 patients with IFG (8.3%) and 24 of the 151 with DM (15.9%). Late gadolinium enhancement was an independent predictor for MACE in both the IFG group (adjusted hazard ratio, 5.186; P = .003) and DM group (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.229; P = .015). MACE-free survival was significantly higher in patients with IFG than in those with DM (P = .019, log-rank test). However, the MACE-free survival curve for patients with IFG and late gadolinium enhancement was similar to that for patients with DM and late gadolinium enhancement (P = .735).The presence of MI detected with late gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging is the strongest multivariable predictor of adverse cardiac events in patients with IFG. Late gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging may help identify a subpopulation of subjects in the prediabetic stage who may benefit from more intensive treatments.",
        "To compare the relative contributions of rest, stress, and delayed acquisitions with the accuracy of dual-energy (DE) computed tomography (CT) for the assessment of myocardial blood supply.With institutional review board approval and HIPAA compliance, 55 consecutive patients (10 women, 45 men; mean age, 62 years \u00b1 10) clinically referred for cardiac single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) who were known to have or were suspected of having coronary artery disease were prospectively enrolled. DE CT studies were acquired during adenosine stress, at rest, and after 6-minute delay. The DE CT iodine distribution maps were visually assessed for perfusion deficits or late iodine enhancement. Per-segment agreement between modalities was investigated with \u03ba statistics. Test characteristics for the detection of perfusion deficits were calculated for combinations of rest, stress, and delayed DE CT acquisition, with SPECT as reference standard.At SPECT, 714 segments were considered normal, 192 showed fixed perfusion defects, and 29 showed reversible perfusion deficits. Sensitivity of rest-only DE CT was 92%, and specificity was 98%. Stress-only, rest-stress, stress and delayed, and the combination of all three had a sensitivity of 99% and a specificity of 97%. Of 29 segments with reversible perfusion deficits at SPECT, 13 (45%) were misclassified by using rest-stress DE CT as fixed perfusion deficits. With stress DE CT plus delayed acquisition, 13 of 192 (7%) segments with fixed perfusion deficits at SPECT were misclassified as reversible.Rest-stress acquisition should be the protocol of choice for assessment of the myocardial blood supply in DE CT. The accuracy of DE CT is not increased by the addition of a delayed DE CT acquisition, which may therefore be omitted to reduce radiation exposure. With rest-stress DE CT, almost one-half of defects that are reversible at SPECT were classified as fixed; radiologists and clinicians need to be aware of this incongruence when they interpret DE CT myocardial perfusion studies.",
        "To analyze the diffusion and perfusion parameters of central gland (CG) prostate cancer, stromal hyperplasia (SH), and glandular hyperplasia (GH) and to determine the role of these parameters in the differentiation of CG cancer from benign CG hyperplasia.In this institutional review board-approved (with waiver of informed consent), HIPAA-compliant study, 38 foci of carcinoma, 38 SH nodules, and 38 GH nodules in the CG were analyzed in 49 patients (26 with CG carcinoma) who underwent preoperative endorectal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and radical prostatectomy. All carcinomas and hyperplastic foci on MR images were localized on the basis of histopathologic correlation. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), the contrast agent transfer rate between blood and tissue (K(trans)), and extravascular extracellular fractional volume values for all carcinoma, SH, and GH foci were calculated. The mean, standard deviation, 95% confidence interval (CI), and range of each parameter were calculated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed for differentiation of CG cancer from SH and GH foci.The average ADCs (\u00d7 10(-3) mm(2)/sec) were 1.05 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.11), 1.27 (95% CI: 1.20, 1.33), and 1.73 (95% CI: 1.64, 1.83), respectively, in CG carcinoma, SH foci, and GH foci and differed significantly, yielding areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) of 0.99 and 0.78, respectively, for differentiation of carcinoma from GH and SH. Perfusion parameters were similar in CG carcinomas and SH foci, with K(trans) yielding the greatest AUCs (0.75 and 0.58, respectively). Adding K(trans) to ADC in ROC analysis to differentiate CG carcinoma from SH increased sensitivity from 38% to 57% at 90% specificity without noticeably increasing the AUC (0.79).ADCs differ significantly between CG carcinoma, SH, and GH, and the use of them can improve the differentiation of CG cancer from SH and GH. Combining K(trans) with ADC can potentially improve the detection of CG cancer.http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.10100021/-/DC1.",
        "Purpose To evaluate the accuracy of trabecular analysis of the lumbar spine by using multidetector computed tomography (CT) in differentiating multiple myeloma patients without spinal fractures from control subjects. Materials and Methods This retrospective single-institution study was approved by the institutional review board, with a waiver of informed consent. Spinal microarchitecture was examined by using 64\u2013detector row CT in 29 patients with multiple myeloma and 51 control subjects. The patients were 13 men and 16 women (mean ages, 71.1 and 69.2 years, respectively). By using multidetector CT data, eight parameters were calculated for the L3 vertebral trabeculae with a three-dimensional image analysis system. The \u03c72 test was used to select a preliminary set of predictors for multiple myeloma. A multivariable generalized linear model was constructed to identify parameters that could be used to differentiate between patients and controls. Parameters with findings of P < .05 were included in the multivariable model. Results Generalized linear models showed that mean trabecular thickness (TbTh) (patients, 703.7 \u03bcm \u00b1 46.7 [standard deviation]; controls, 661.1 \u03bcm \u00b1 35.7) and fractal dimension (FD) (patients, 2.23 \u00b1 0.24; controls, 2.41 \u00b1 0.15) in men (P = .05 and .03, respectively) and degree of anisotropy (DA) (patients, 1.63 \u00b1 0.23; controls, 1.38 \u00b1 0.10) in women (P = .02) had significant effects in differentiation between patients and controls. Conclusion Significant differences were observed in spinal microarchitecture between control subjects and multiple myeloma patients without pathologic fractures. Independent predictors of multiple myeloma included TbTh and FD in male patients and DA in female patients. \u00a9 RSNA, 2011",
        "To develop a new automated filtering technique and to evaluate its ability to compensate for the known low contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in dynamic contrast material-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomographic (CT) data, without substantial loss of information.Clinical data acquisition for this study was approved by the institutional review board. Principal component analysis (PCA) was combined with the fraction of residual information (FRI) criterion to optimize the balance between noise reduction efficiency and information conservation. The PCA FRI filter was evaluated in 15 DCE MR imaging data sets and 15 DCE CT data sets by two radiologists who performed visual analysis and quantitative assessment of noise reduction after filtering.Visual evaluation revealed a substantial noise reduction while conserving information in 90% of MR imaging cases and 87% of CT cases for image analysis and in 93% of MR imaging cases and 90% of CT cases for signal analysis. Efficient denoising enabled improvement in structure characterization in 60% of MR imaging cases and 77% of CT cases. After filtering, CNR was improved by 2.06 \u00b1 0.89 for MR imaging (P < .01) and by 5.72 \u00b1 4.82 for CT (P < .01).This PCA FRI filter demonstrates noise reduction efficiency and information conservation for both DCE MR data and DCE CT data. FRI analysis enabled automated optimization of the parameters for the PCA filter and provided an optional visual control of residual information losses. The robust and fast PCA FRI filter may improve qualitative or quantitative analysis of DCE imaging in a clinical context.http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.10100231/-/DC1.",
        "To estimate the effect of the number of computed tomography (CT) sections on trapped air (TA) assessment in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) by using an established scoring system and a new quantitative scoring system and to compare CT and pulmonary function test (PFT) estimates of TA in a cross-sectional and longitudinal study.In this institutional review board-approved pilot study, 20 subjects aged 6-20 years (12 female and eight male; median age, 12.6 years) contributed two expiratory CT studies (three-section baseline CT, volumetric follow-up CT) and two PFT studies over 2 years after parental informed consent was obtained. From follow-up CT studies, seven sets were composed: Set 1 was volumetric. Sets 2, 3, 4, and 5, had spacing of 2.4, 4.8, 9.6, and 20.4 mm, respectively, between sections. Sets 6 and 7 contained five and three sections, respectively. Longitudinal follow-up was performed with three sections. All images were deidentified and randomized, and TA was scored with the Brody II system and a new quantitative system. Statistical analysis included the Wilcoxon signed rank test, calculation of Spearman and intraclass correlation coefficients, and use of three-section and linear mixed models.For the Brody II system, the intraclass correlation coefficient for set 1 versus those for sets 2 through 7 was 0.75 versus 0.87; however, mean scores from sets 6 and 7 were significantly lower than the mean score from set 1 (P = .01 and P < .001, respectively). For the quantitative system, the number of sections did not affect TA assessment (intraclass correlation coefficient range, 0.82-0.88; P > .13 for all). CT and PFT estimates were not correlated (r(s) = 20.19 to 0.09, P = .43-.93). No change in TA over time was found for CT or PFT (P > .16 for all).The number of sections affected Brody II estimates, suggesting that three-section protocols lead to underestimation of TA assessment in patients with CF when using the Brody II system; CT and PFT estimates of TA showed no correlation and no significant change over time.",
        "Purpose To investigate associations between computed tomographic (CT) features of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and mutations in VHL, PBRM1, SETD2, KDM5C, or BAP1 genes. Materials and Methods The institutional review board approved this retrospective, hypothesis-generating study of 233 patients with clear cell RCC and waived the informed consent requirement. The study was HIPAA compliant. Three radiologists independently reviewed pretreatment CT images of all clear cell RCCs without knowledge of their genomic profile. One radiologist measured largest diameter and enhancement parameters of each clear cell RCC. Associations between CT features and mutations in VHL, PBRM1, SETD2, KDM5C, and BAP1 genes were tested by using the Fisher exact test. Associations between mutations and size and enhancement were assessed by using the independent t test. Interreader agreement was calculated by using the Fleiss \u03ba. Results Mutation frequencies among clear cell RCCs were as follows: VHL, 53.2% (124 of 233); PBRM1, 28.8% (67 of 233); SETD2, 7.3% (17 of 233); KDM5C, 6.9% (16 of 233); and BAP1, 6.0% (14 of 233). Mutations of VHL were significantly associated with well-defined tumor margins (P = .013), nodular tumor enhancement (P = .021), and gross appearance of intratumoral vascularity (P = .018). Mutations of KDM5C and BAP1 were significantly associated with evidence of renal vein invasion (P = .022 and .046, respectively). The genotype of solid clear cell RCC differed significantly from the genotype of multicystic clear cell RCC. While mutations of SETD2, KDM5C, and BAP1 were absent in multicystic clear cell RCC, mutations of VHL (P = .016) and PBRM1 (P = .017) were significantly more common among solid clear cell RCC. Interreader agreement for CT feature assessments ranged from substantial to excellent (\u03ba = 0.791\u20130.912). Conclusion This preliminary radiogenomics analysis of clear cell RCC revealed associations between CT features and underlying mutations that warrant further investigation and validation. \u00a9RSNA, 2013 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To assess the incremental value of split-bolus multidetector computed tomography (CT) combined with fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) for follow-up of oncologic patients.The institutional ethics committee approved the use of this protocol. Thirty-eight oncologic patients who underwent FDG PET/unenhanced multidetector CT and split-bolus multidetector CT for restaging were investigated retrospectively. The split-bolus CT protocol included imaging during the hepatic arterial and portal venous phases in one scan. Software was used for fusion of the independently acquired FDG PET and split-bolus CT data, and fused datasets were compared with FDG PET/unenhanced CT data. The standard of reference for diagnosis of lesions in all patients was a combination of histologic results (if available), clinical results (medical history, physical examination, and laboratory test results), and the results of follow-up imaging (conventional CT, magnetic resonance imaging, and/or ultrasonography) for at least 6 months. Descriptive statistics were used.Fifty-nine true-positive lesions were identified with fused FDG PET/split-bolus CT; 41 were concordant and detected with both split-bolus CT and PET/unenhanced CT, 16 with split-bolus CT only, and two with PET/unenhanced CT. Two different false-positive lesions were identified with PET/unenhanced CT and PET/split-bolus CT. Furthermore, in 20 of 38 (53%) patients, FDG PET/split-bolus CT allowed detection of important additional findings (n = 40) not detected at FDG PET/unenhanced CT. Both the tumor-related findings (n = 13, 32.5%) and the non-tumor-related findings (n = 27, 67.5%) were important to the clinical treatment of these patients.Fused FDG PET/split-bolus multidetector CT provides additional information compared with FDG PET/unenhanced multidetector CT in oncologic patients.",
        "Purpose To compare the clinical impact of combined positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to that of combined PET and computed tomography (CT) performed on the same day in patients with cancer. Materials and Methods This HIPAA-compliant retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board. Patients gave written informed consent for study enrollment, including the possibility to use their imaging and clinical data in future evaluations. A total of 134 patients with cancer with a non\u2013central nervous system primary neoplasm underwent same-day fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT and FDG PET/MR imaging. PET/CT and PET/MR studies were independently interpreted by teams of radiologists and nuclear medicine physicians. Four readers, divided into two teams composed of one radiologist and one nuclear medicine physician each, read all 134 studies. The referring physician classified discordance between PET/CT and PET/MR observations either as findings affecting clinical management or as findings not affecting clinical management. Data were compared with the \u03c72 test. Results Findings affecting clinical management were noted for PET/CT studies but not for PET/MR studies in two (1.5%) of 134 patients and for PET/MR studies but not for PET/CT studies in 24 (17.9%) of 134 patients. The discrepancies between findings affecting clinical management detected with PET/MR imaging over those detected with PET/CT were significant (P < .001). Conclusion In these patients, PET/MR imaging alone contributed to clinical management more often than did PET/CT alone. PET/MR imaging provides information that affects the care of patients with cancer and is unavailable from PET/CT. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To compare the performance of multiphase computed tomographic (CT) enterography with that of capsule endoscopy in a group of patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB).This prospective HIPAA-compliant study was approved by the institutional review board and the institutional conflict of interest committee. All patients provided written informed consent. Two radiologists, blinded to clinical data and results of capsule endoscopy, interpreted images from CT enterography independently, with discordant interpretations resolved by consensus. Results were compared with those from a reference standard (surgery or endoscopy) and clinical follow-up. Sensitivity and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each modality.Fifty-eight adult patients, referred for the evaluation of OGIB (occult, 25 patients [43%]; overt, 33 patients [57%]), underwent both tests. A small bowel bleeding source was identified in 16 of the 58 patients (28%). The sensitivity of CT enterography was significantly greater than that of capsule endoscopy (88% [14 of 16 patients] vs 38% [six of 16 patients], respectively; P = .008), largely because it depicted more small bowel masses (100% [nine of nine patients] vs 33% [three of nine patients], respectively; P = .03). No additional small bowel tumors were discovered during the follow-up period (range, 5.6-45.9 months; mean, 16.6 months).In this referral population, the sensitivity of CT enterography for detecting small bowel bleeding sources and small bowel masses was significantly greater than that of capsule endoscopy. On the basis of these findings, the addition of multiphase CT enterography to the routine diagnostic work-up of patients with OGIB should be considered, particularly in patients with negative findings at capsule endoscopy.",
        "To investigate the patterns of imaging appearance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) on gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) images and to assess their potential value as prognostic markers of HCC associated with tumor recurrence after surgery.The institutional review board approved this retrospective study and informed consent was waived. A total of 216 patients with 304 pathologically proved HCCs underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging prior to surgery and were included in the study. Two reviewers, blinded to the clinical data, evaluated in consensus the imaging patterns of HCC according to enhancement patterns on dynamic phase images and signal intensity on hepatobiliary phase (HBP) images. The association of imaging features with clinical-pathologic findings was evaluated by using the Student t test, \u03c7(2) test, Mann-Whitney U test, and linear-by-linear association. The dependence of time to tumor recurrence (TTR) after surgery was evaluated by using the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazard model.HCCs with atypical enhancement pattern (P = .0167, P = .0450, P < .0001, respectively) and iso- to hyperintensity on HBP images (P = .0001, P = .0002, P < .0001, respectively) had smaller tumor size, lower histologic grade, and worse Child-Pugh class. The log-rank test (P = .0064) and Cox proportional hazards model (hazard ratio, 5.676; P = .0158) revealed that HCCs with iso- to hyperintensity on HBP images had significantly longer TTR than HCCs with hypointensity on HBP images.HCCs can be classified into several imaging patterns on gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR images, which are associated with tumor aggressiveness and outcome. In addition, iso- to hyperintensity on HBP images may be a useful imaging biomarker to indicate longer TTR after surgery. .",
        "Purpose To establish performance benchmarks for modern screening digital mammography and assess performance trends over time in U.S. community practice. Materials and Methods This HIPAA-compliant, institutional review board\u2013approved study measured the performance of digital screening mammography interpreted by 359 radiologists across 95 facilities in six Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) registries. The study included 1 682 504 digital screening mammograms performed between 2007 and 2013 in 792 808 women. Performance measures were calculated according to the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System, 5th edition, and were compared with published benchmarks by the BCSC, the National Mammography Database, and performance recommendations by expert opinion. Benchmarks were derived from the distribution of performance metrics across radiologists and were presented as 50th (median), 10th, 25th, 75th, and 90th percentiles, with graphic presentations using smoothed curves. Results Mean screening performance measures were as follows: abnormal interpretation rate (AIR), 11.6 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.5, 11.6); cancers detected per 1000 screens, or cancer detection rate (CDR), 5.1 (95% CI: 5.0, 5.2); sensitivity, 86.9% (95% CI: 86.3%, 87.6%); specificity, 88.9% (95% CI: 88.8%, 88.9%); false-negative rate per 1000 screens, 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7, 0.8); positive predictive value (PPV) 1, 4.4% (95% CI: 4.3%, 4.5%); PPV2, 25.6% (95% CI: 25.1%, 26.1%); PPV3, 28.6% (95% CI: 28.0%, 29.3%); cancers stage 0 or 1, 76.9%; minimal cancers, 57.7%; and node-negative invasive cancers, 79.4%. Recommended CDRs were achieved by 92.1% of radiologists in community practice, and 97.1% achieved recommended ranges for sensitivity. Only 59.0% of radiologists achieved recommended AIRs, and only 63.0% achieved recommended levels of specificity. Conclusion The majority of radiologists in the BCSC surpass cancer detection recommendations for screening mammography; however, AIRs continue to be higher than the recommended rate for almost half of radiologists interpreting screening mammograms. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",

        "To determine adverse reaction rates in a tertiary care clinical setting after adoption of gadoteridol as the institutional routine magnetic resonance (MR) imaging contrast agent.With institutional review board approval, informed consent waiver, and HIPAA compliance, a prospective observational study of 28 078 patients who underwent intravenous gadoteridol-enhanced MR imaging from July 2007 to December 2009 was performed. Reactions were recorded by technologists who noted types of reactions, method of injection, and treatment. Reactions were classified as mild, moderate, or severe per American College of Radiology definitions. Comparisons of reaction rates with dose and method of injection were analyzed with the Fisher exact and \u03c7(2) tests.Overall reaction rate was 0.666% (187 patients), including 177 mild, six moderate, and four severe reactions. Treatment was given in 27 patients (14.4%). The most frequent reaction was nausea (and/or vomiting) in 149 patients (79.7% of patients with any adverse reaction, 0.530% of overall population). Method of injection did not affect reaction rate or severity. There was no difference in type or severity of reactions in comparison of patients receiving half the dose versus patients receiving the standard dose (P = .33-.75).The observed adverse reaction rate to gadoteridol was lower than previously reported. Specifically, the rate of nausea (0.530%) was less than half the rate (1.4%) in clinical trials of 1251 patients, leading to FDA approval in 1992. Rates of adverse reactions for this macrocyclic contrast agent are comparable to those published for linear gadolinium-based contrast agents.",
        "Purpose To investigate whether apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) derived from diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging at 3 T correlate with the clinical risk of prostate cancer in patients with tumors that are visible on MR images, with MR imaging/transrectal ultrasonography (US) fusion\u2013guided biopsy as a reference. Materials and Methods Forty-eight consecutive patients (median age, 60 years; median serum prostate-specific antigen value, 6.3 ng/mL) who underwent DW imaging during 3-T MR imaging with an endorectal coil were included in this retrospective institutional review board\u2013approved study, and informed consent was obtained from each patient. Patients underwent targeted MR imaging/transrectal US fusion\u2013guided prostate biopsy. Mean ADCs of cancerous target tumors were correlated with Gleason and D'Amico clinical risk scores. The true risk group rate and predictive value of the mean ADC for classifying a tumor by its D'Amico clinical risk score was determined by using linear discriminant and receiver operating characteristic analyses. Results A significant negative correlation was found between mean ADCs of tumors in the peripheral zone and their Gleason scores (P = .003; Spearman \u03c1 = \u22120.60) and D'Amico clinical risk scores (P < .0001; Spearman \u03c1 = \u22120.69). ADC was found to distinguish tumors in the peripheral zone with intermediate to high clinical risk from those with low clinical risk with a correct classification rate of 0.73.

ADCs may therefore be useful in predicting the aggressiveness of prostate cancer. \u00a9 RSNA, 2010 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.10100667/-/DC1",
        "Purpose To evaluate the normal biodistribution and kinetics of (S)-4-(3-[18F]fluoropropyl)-l-glutamic acid ((18)F FSPG) in healthy volunteers and to compare (18)F FSPG mean and maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmean and SUVmax, respectively) with those of (18)F fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) across a variety of organs. Materials and Methods This protocol was reviewed and approved by all appropriate regulatory authorities. An 8-mCi (\u00b110%) dose of (18)F FSPG was given to five subjects (three women, two men), and seven whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) scans were performed 5, 10, 20, 30, 45, 150, and 240 minutes after injection. Regions of interest were analyzed on the resultant (18)F FSPG images to evaluate the kinetics of this radiotracer. The images obtained 45 minutes after injection were used to measure SUVmean and SUVmax in additional regions of the body. These values were compared with similar values obtained with (18)F FDG PET published previously. Descriptive statistics, including average and standard deviation across the five subjects, were used. (18)F FSPG SUVmean and SUVmax were compared. Results On the (18)F FSPG images obtained 45 minutes after injection, there was only low-grade background activity in the majority of analyzed regions. Prominent activity was seen throughout the pancreas. Clearance of the radiotracer through the kidneys and collection in the bladder also were seen. SUV quantification shows notable differences between (18)F FSPG and (18)F FDG in the pancreas ((18)F FSPG SUVmean, 8.2; (18)F FDG SUVmean, 1.3), stomach ((18)F FSPG SUVmax, 3.6; (18)F FDG SUVmax, 1.6), and brain ((18)F FSPG SUVmean, 0.08; (18)F FDG SUVmean, 7.8). The kinetic data showed rapid clearance of the radiotracer from the blood pool and most organs, except the pancreas. Conclusion (18)F FSPG is a PET radiopharmaceutical characterized by rapid clearance from most healthy tissues, except the pancreas and kidneys. A consistent biodistribution pattern was observed with low background uptake. The physiologic uptake of this new radiotracer throughout the body is described in more detail, which is important for improved interpretative accuracy and understanding potential clinical applications.

        "To investigate the correlation between magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings and pathologic subtype classification of hepatocellular adenoma (HCA).This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and the requirement for informed consent was waived. MR imaging studies of 61 lesions (48 patients; median age, 36 years) were available and were independently reviewed by two radiologists. Consensus readings on all morphologic and signal-intensity imaging features were obtained. Previously, these lesions had been classified on the basis of pathologic findings and immunohistochemical analysis. Fisher exact and \u03c7\u00b2 tests were performed to compare the results between the different subtypes. A Bonferroni correction was applied to correct for multiple testing (\u03b1 < .0033).MR imaging signs of diffuse intratumoral fat deposition were present in seven (78%) of nine liver-fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP)-negative HCAs compared with five (17%) of 29 inflammatory HCAs (P = .001). Steatosis within the nontumoral liver was present in 11 (38%) of 29 inflammatory HCAs compared with none of the L-FABP-negative HCAs (P = .038). A characteristic atoll sign was only seen in the inflammatory group (P = .027). Presence of a typical vaguely defined type of scar was seen in five (71%) of seven \u03b2-catenin-positive HCAs (P = .003). No specific MR imaging features were identified for the unclassified cases.L-FABP-negative, inflammatory, and \u03b2-catenin-positive HCAs were related to MR imaging signs of diffuse intratumoral fat deposition, an atoll sign, and a typical vaguely defined scar, respectively. Since \u03b2-catenin-positive HCAs are considered premalignant, closer follow-up with MR imaging or resection may be preferred.",
        "To assess the feasibility of multiplanar vascular navigation with a new magnetically assisted remote-controlled (MARC) catheter with real-time magnetic resonance (MR) imaging at 1.5 T and 3 T and to compare it with standard x-ray guidance in simulated endovascular catheterization procedures.A 1.6-mm-diameter custom clinical-grade microcatheter prototype with lithographed double-saddle coils at the distal tip was deflected with real-time MR imaging. Two inexperienced operators and two experienced operators catheterized anteroposterior (celiac, superior mesenteric, and inferior mesenteric arteries) and mediolateral (renal arteries) branch vessels in a cryogel abdominal aortic phantom. This was repeated with conventional x-ray fluoroscopy by using clinical catheters and guidewires. Mean procedure times and percentage success data were analyzed with linear mixed-effects regression.The MARC catheter tip was visible at 1.5 T and 3 T. Among inexperienced operators, MARC MR imaging guidance was not statistically different from x-ray guidance at 1.5 T (67% successful vessel selection turns with MR imaging vs 76% with x-ray guidance, P = .157) and at 3 T (75% successful turns with MR imaging vs 76% with x-ray guidance, P = .869). Experienced operators were more successful in catheterizing vessels with x-ray guidance (98% success within 60 seconds) than with 1.5-T (65%, P < .001) or 3-T (75%) MR imaging. Among inexperienced operators, mean procedure time was nearly equivalent by using MR imaging (31 seconds) and x-ray guidance (34 seconds, P = .436). Among experienced operators, catheterization was faster with x-ray guidance (20 seconds) compared with 1.5-T MR imaging (42 seconds, P < .001), but MARC guidance improved at 3 T (31 seconds). MARC MR imaging guidance at 3 T was not significantly different from x-ray guidance for the celiac (P = .755), superior mesenteric (P = .358), and inferior mesenteric (P = .065) arteries.Multiplanar navigation with a new MARC catheter with real-time MR imaging at 1.5 T and 3 T is feasible and comparable to x-ray guidance for anteroposterior vessels at 3 T in a vascular phantom.",
        "The Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound convened a panel of specialists from radiology, hepatology, pathology, and basic science and physics to arrive at a consensus regarding the use of elastography in the assessment of liver fibrosis in chronic liver disease. The panel met in Denver, Colo, on October 21-22, 2014, and drafted this consensus statement. The recommendations in this statement are based on analysis of current literature and common practice strategies and are thought to represent a reasonable approach to the noninvasive assessment of diffuse liver fibrosis.",
        "Purpose To assess diagnostic performance and interreader agreement of tumor-to-sinus distance measurements and visual assessment of renal sinus fat invasion at T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging as predictors of muscular venous branch invasion (MVBI) in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Materials and Methods The institutional review board approved this retrospective study and waived the informed consent requirement. The study was HIPAA compliant. A total of 186 consecutive patients underwent preoperative 1.5-T MR imaging; 188 RCCs were identified. Blinded to histopathologic information, two readers independently measured the tumor-to-sinus distance and assessed renal sinus fat invasion on transverse and coronal T2-weighted MR images. Interreader agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient, Cohen \u03ba) and performance characteristics of imaging tests were calculated. Histopathologic findings served as the standard of reference. Results Histopathologic findings indicated MVBI in 35% (66 of 188) of tumors. At imaging, all tumors with MVBI had a tumor-to-sinus distance of 0 mm. All tumors with renal sinus fat invasion at imaging had MVBI. Sensitivity and specificity for the detection of renal sinus fat invasion were 100% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 92%, 100%) and 94% (95% CI: 89%, 98%). In the absence of renal sinus fat invasion at imaging, a tumor-to-sinus distance of 0 mm was associated with MVBI in 21% (18 of 86) of cases. Interreader agreement for quantitative (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.92; 95% CI: 0.89, 0.94) and qualitative (\u03ba = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.81, 0.96) assessments was excellent. Conclusion Tumor-to-sinus distance measurements and the assessment of renal sinus fat invasion at T2-weighted MR imaging can be used reliably to rule out MVBI in patients with RCC. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "To (a) use a new second-generation wide-volume 320-detector row computed tomographic (CT) scanner to explore optimization of radiation exposure in coronary CT angiography in an unselected and consecutive cohort of patients referred for clinical purposes and (b) compare estimated radiation exposure and image quality with that from a cohort of similar patients who underwent imaging with a previous first-generation CT system.The study was approved by the institutional review board, and all subjects provided written consent. Coronary CT angiography was performed in 107 consecutive patients with a new second-generation 320-detector row unit. Estimated radiation exposure and image quality were compared with those from 100 consecutive patients who underwent imaging with a previous first-generation scanner. Effective radiation dose was estimated by multiplying the dose-length product by an effective dose conversion factor of 0.014 mSv/mGy \u22c5 cm and reported with size-specific dose estimates (SSDEs). Image quality was evaluated by two independent readers.The mean age of the 107 patients was 55.4 years \u00b1 12.0 (standard deviation); 57 patients (53.3%) were men. The median body mass index was 27.3 kg/m(2) (range, 18.1-47.2 kg/m(2)); however, 71 patients (66.4%) were overweight, obese, or morbidly obese. A tube potential of 100 kV was used in 97 patients (90.6%), single-volume acquisition was used in 104 (97.2%), and prospective electrocardiographic gating was used in 106 (99.1%). The mean heart rate was 57.1 beats per minute \u00b1 11.2 (range, 34-96 beats per minute), which enabled single-heartbeat scans in 100 patients (93.4%). The median radiation dose was 0.93 mSv (interquartile range [IQR], 0.58-1.74 mSv) with the second-generation unit and 2.67 mSv (IQR, 1.68-4.00 mSv) with the first-generation unit (P < .0001). The median SSDE was 6.0 mGy (IQR, 4.1-10.0 mGy) with the second-generation unit and 13.2 mGy (IQR, 10.2-18.6 mGy) with the first-generation unit (P < .0001). Overall, the radiation dose was less than 0.5 mSv for 23 of the 107 CT angiography examinations (21.5%), less than 1 mSv for 58 (54.2%), and less than 4 mSv for 103 (96.3%). All studies were of diagnostic quality, with most having excellent image quality. Three of four image quality indexes were significantly better with the second-generation unit compared with the first-generation unit.The combination of a gantry rotation time of 275 msec, wide volume coverage, iterative reconstruction, automated exposure control, and larger x-ray power generator of the second-generation CT scanner provides excellent image quality over a wide range of body sizes and heart rates at low radiation doses.http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.13122621/-/DC1.",
        "To document utility of shear-wave (SW) elastography for assessing liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis B and to compare its performance with that of transient elastography.Ethics committee approved the study, and informed consent was obtained. Patients with liver biopsy correlation (n = 226) and healthy patients (n = 171) were analyzed. Results of SW elastography of liver, SW elastography of spleen, and transient elastography of liver were compared and correlated according to METAVIR scores. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs), binary logistic regression, and Delong test were used.AUC for SW elastography of liver, transient elastography of liver, and SW elastography of spleen was, respectively, 0.86, 0.80, and 0.81 for fibrosis (\u2265 F1 stage); 0.88, 0.78, and 0.82 for moderate fibrosis (\u2265 F2 stage); 0.93, 0.83, and 0.83 for severe fibrosis (\u2265 F3 stage); and 0.98, 0.92, and 0.84 for cirrhosis (F4 stage). SW elastography of liver showed significantly higher accuracy than transient elastography of liver and SW elastography of spleen in all fibrosis stages (P = .01-.04). SW elastography of spleen showed similar accuracy with transient elastography of liver (P = .21-.99). Combination SW elastography of liver and SW elastography of spleen to predict fibrosis staging showed diagnostic accuracy not further improved compared with SW elastography of liver alone (similar AUC; \u2265 F1, P = .87; \u2265 F2, P = .81; \u2265 F3, P = .84; \u2265 F4, P = .88). SW elastography of liver had higher successful rate than transient elastography of liver (98.9% vs 89.6%). Prevalence of discordance in at least two stages with liver histologic staging was 10.2% (23 of 226) for SW elastography of liver and 28.2% (58 of 206) for SW elastography of spleen.SW elastography provides more accurate correlation of liver elasticity with liver fibrosis stage compared with transient elastography, especially in identification of stage F2 or greater.",
        "To evaluate the diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-estimated proton density fat fraction (PDFF) for assessing hepatic steatosis in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) by using centrally scored histopathologic validation as the reference standard.This prospectively designed, cross-sectional, internal review board-approved, HIPAA-compliant study was conducted in 77 patients who had NAFLD and liver biopsy. MR imaging-PDFF was estimated from magnitude-based low flip angle multiecho gradient-recalled echo images after T2* correction and multifrequency fat modeling. Histopathologic scoring was obtained by consensus of the Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) Clinical Research Network Pathology Committee. Spearman correlation, additivity and variance stabilization for regression for exploring the effect of a number of potential confounders, and receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed.Liver MR imaging-PDFF was systematically higher, with higher histologic steatosis grade (P < .001), and was significantly correlated with histologic steatosis grade (\u03c1 = 0.69, P < .001). The correlation was not confounded by age, sex, lobular inflammation, hepatocellular ballooning, NASH diagnosis, fibrosis, or magnetic field strength (P = .65). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curves was 0.989 (95% confidence interval: 0.968, 1.000) for distinguishing patients with steatosis grade 0 (n = 5) from those with grade 1 or higher (n = 72), 0.825 (95% confidence interval: 0.734, 0.915) to distinguish those with grade 1 or lower (n = 31) from those with grade 2 or higher (n = 46), and 0.893 (95% confidence interval: 0.809, 0.977) to distinguish those with grade 2 or lower (n = 58) from those with grade 3 (n = 19).MR imaging-PDFF showed promise for assessment of hepatic steatosis grade in patients with NAFLD. For validation, further studies with larger sample sizes are needed.",
        "Purpose To develop a method to assess volumetric cortical bone porosity in clinically practical acquisition times by measuring the signal decay at only two echo times (TEs) as part of a single three-dimensional ultrashort TE (UTE) magnetic resonance (MR) examination. Materials and Methods The study was approved by the institutional review board and complied with HIPAA guidelines. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. A marker of cortical bone porosity called porosity index was defined as the ratio of UTE image intensities at a long and short TE, and the results were compared with biexponential analysis. Porosity index of midtibia cortical bone samples obtained from 16 donors was compared with ground-truth porosity by using micro\u2013computed tomographic (CT) imaging and bone mineral density by peripheral quantitative CT scanner. Reproducibility of porosity index were tested in volunteers, and clinical feasibility was evaluated in postmenopausal women. Interparameter associations were assessed by using Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficient. Results Bone specimen porosity index was correlated with micro-CT imaging porosity (R2 = 0.79) and pore size (R2 = 0.81); age (R2 = 0.64); peripheral quantitative CT scanner density (R2 = 0.49, negatively); and pore water fraction (R2 = 0.62) and T2* (R2 = 0.64) by biexponential analysis. The reproducibility study yielded a coefficient of variation of 2.2% and intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.97. The study that involved postmenopausal women showed a wide range of porosity index (15%\u201338%). Conclusion A two-point MR imaging method to assess cortical bone porosity in humans was conceived and validated. This approach has the potential for clinical use to assess changes in cortical bone porosity that result from disease or in response to therapy. \u00a9 RSNA, 2015 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To assess whether native T1 mapping provides noninvasive estimation of diffuse myocardial fibrosis and whether it correlates with subclinical myocardial dysfunction in asymptomatic patients with aortic stenosis (AS).The local institutional review board approved the study, and all patients gave informed consent. Eighty asymptomatic patients with moderate or severe AS and normal left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (mean age, 67 years; range, 31-81 years) and 15 sex-matched control subjects (mean age, 33 years; range, 23-41 years) were prospectively enrolled. Patients underwent two-dimensional echocardiography, speckle tracking imaging, and cardiac 3.0-T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, including mapping of T1 relaxation time by using the modified Look-Locker inversion-recovery sequence. Correlations between native T1 values and the degree of diffuse fibrosis in myocardial specimens obtained during aortic valve replacement surgery were analyzed in a subset of 20 patients. Correlations between parameters of myocardial function and structure and native T1 values were assessed with Pearson correlation coefficients.Native T1 values correlated well with the degree of diffuse myocardial fibrosis in intraoperative myocardial biopsy specimens (r = 0.777, P < .001) and differed significantly between patients with AS and control subjects (1208 msec \u00b1 45 vs 1169 msec \u00b1 21, P < .001). LV volumes and mass differed significantly according to AS groups, categorized by T1 tertiles (all P < .001), as well as degree of AS severity (0.55 cm(2)/m(2) \u00b1 0.14 for lowest native T1 tertile, 0.46 cm(2)/m(2) \u00b1 0.12 for middle native T1 tertile, and 0.45 cm(2)/m(2) \u00b1 0.13 for highest native T1 tertile [P = .008] for indexed aortic valve area at echocardiography).

There may be associated ileus and perforation leading to surgical emergency with high mortality.\r\nDiabetes mellitus is a debilitating disease that affects all systems in the body and Literature documents a higher incidence of complications associated with gallstone disease (GSD) in diabetics than in the non-diabetic population. No local document regarding the association between GS formation and DM is available. This study was therefore designed to determine the incidence of gallstones in diabetes mellitus, the effect of demographic and social factors on the formation of GS in diabetic patients. The study also evaluated the association between clinical symptoms and type of DM more prevalent with gallstone formation.Methodology:\r\n400 diabetic patients of aged between 15years and 82years, attending the Diabetic clinic at the University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan within a six month- period were examined for presence of gallstones using ultrasonography.Results:\r\nGS was found in 70 (17.5%) out of the 400 patients; 59 (51.92%) of these were above the age of 40 and in effect were of type II DM; with a male to female ratio\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof 3:4; BMI greater than 25kgm-2 were seen in 56 (48.3%) patients; smoking and alcohol intake were insignificantly implicated.Jaundice was recorded in 8 (11.4%) while abdominal pain was in 24 (34.3%) and 52 (74.3%) patients of those with GSD had had diabetes for more than 4years.Conclusion:\r\nIncidence of gallstone disease in diabetes mellitus is influenced significantly by age, BMI and duration of the disease, while the influence of gender, social factors and parity are not strong associated factors.",
        "Purpose To predict survival in patients with metastatic melanoma by evaluating a combination of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level and initial computed tomographic (CT) findings of tumor devascularization after antiangiogenic therapy. Materials and Methods Consent was waived for this institutional review board\u2013approved, retrospective, secondary analysis. Forty-four patients with metastatic melanoma received bevacizumab therapy in a randomized prospective phase II trial. Target lesions on the initial posttherapy CT images were evaluated by using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, the Choi criteria, and Morphology, Attenuation, Size, and Structure (MASS) criteria. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association of baseline clinical variables including serum LDH and imaging findings with progression-free and overall survival. The receiver operating characteristic curve with area under the curve (AUC) was used to evaluate accuracy. Results In multivariate analysis, a high baseline serum LDH level was associated with decreased progression-free survival (hazard ratio = 1.29 for each increase of 100 IU/L; P = .002) and overall survival (hazard ratio = 1.44 for each increase of 100 IU/L; P = .001). Evaluation with MASS criteria of the first CT examination after therapy strongly predicted progression-free (P < .001) and overall (P < .001) survival. Baseline serum LDH level was moderately accurate for predicting progression-free survival at 9 months (AUC = 0.793) and overall survival at 18 months (AUC = 0.689). The combination of baseline serum LDH levels and evaluation with MASS criteria at the first CT examination after therapy had significantly higher accuracy for predicting progression-free survival at 9 months (AUC = 0.969) and overall survival at 18 months (AUC = 0.813) than did baseline serum LDH levels alone for prediction of progression-free survival (P = .020). Conclusion A combination of baseline serum LDH levels and evaluation with MASS criteria at the first CT examination after bevacizumab therapy had the highest accuracy for predicting survival in patients with metastatic melanoma. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To determine whether two-view shear-wave elastography (SWE) improves the performance of radiologists in differentiating benign from malignant breast masses compared with single-view SWE. Materials and Methods This prospective study was conducted with institutional review board approval, and written informed consent was obtained. B-mode ultrasonographic (US) and orthogonal SWE images were obtained for 219 breast masses (136 benign and 83 malignant; mean size, 14.8 mm) in 219 consecutive women (mean age, 47.9 years; range, 20-78 years). Five blinded radiologists independently assessed the likelihood of malignancy for three data sets: B-mode US alone, B-mode US and single-view SWE, and B-mode US and two-view SWE. Interobserver agreement regarding Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) category and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of each data set were compared. Results Interobserver agreement was moderate (\u03ba = 0.560 \u00b1 0.015 [standard error of the mean]) for BI-RADS category assessment with B-mode US alone. When SWE was added to B-mode US, five readers showed substantial interobserver agreement (\u03ba = 0.629 \u00b1 0.017 for single-view SWE; \u03ba = 0.651 \u00b1 0.014 for two-view SWE). The mean AUC of B-mode US was 0.870 (range, 0.855-0.884).

        "To compare the effective fetal dose reduction at different stages of gestation during maternal computed tomographic (CT) pulmonary angiography by using traditional lead apron and bismuth-antimony shields combined with limited z-axis and tube current.Phantom with gravid prosthesis, 0.5-mm lead, and two grades of bismuth-antimony shield was used. Thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) measured radiation in the first- to third-trimester uterus. Fetal dose was determined for each gestation by using 100 kVp to the costophrenic angles (CPAs) with and without shielding for a total of 12 scans. Eight third-trimester scans were used to compare shields using 120 kVp to CPAs versus those using 100 kVp to the diaphragm.Average fetal dose increased with gestation with use of 100 kVp to CPAs, from 0.11 mGy in first trimester to 0.50 mGy in third trimester. Average third-trimester unshielded fetal dose was reduced from 0.82 mGy by using 120 kVp to CPAs to 0.17 mGy (79%, P < .001) by using 100 kVp to the diaphragm. Lead apron reduced dose more than either of the bismuth-antimony shields (72%-79% vs 57%-81%) with use of 100 kVp to CPAs. Shields reduced the dose by 73% (lead), 62% (90% attenuation bismuth-antimony), and 72% (95% attenuation bismuth-antimony) (P < .01) at 120 kVp to CPAs. No significant difference between shields was demonstrated with 100 kVp to the diaphragm (P < .01). Maternal dose was 8.13 mSv at 120 kVp to CPAs, 4.90 mSv at 100 kVp to CPAs, and 4.02 mSv at 100 kVp to the diaphragm.Reducing voltage and limiting z-axis is more effective than shields at reducing fetal dose. Shielding improves reduction with no significant difference between lead and bismuth-antimony shields when conservative scanning parameters are observed.",
        "Purpose To (a) perform a pilot study comparing radiologists' reading of breast density at computed tomography (CT) of the chest with breast density readings from mammography performed in the same patient and (b) compare a subset of these with computer-derived measurements of breast density at CT. Materials and Methods The institutional review board waived informed consent for this HIPAA-compliant retrospective review of mammograms and chest CT scans from 206 women obtained within 1 year of each other. Two radiologists with expertise in interpreting mammographic and CT findings independently reviewed the mammograms and CT scans and classified each case into one of the four breast density types defined by the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System of the American College of Radiology. Interreader agreements for the mammographic density types and CT density grades were determined by using the Cohen weighted \u03ba statistic. The intrareader correlation coefficient was determined in a subset of CT images. In another subset of 40 cases, the agreement of the semiautomated computer-derived measurements of breast density with the consensus of the two radiologists was assessed. Results Interreader agreement was higher for the CT density grades than for the mammographic density types, with 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.73, 0.85) versus 0.62 (95% CI: 0.54, 0.70). The intrareader reliability of breast density grades on CT images was 0.88. The computer-derived breast density measurements agreed with those of the radiologists in 36 (90%) cases. When four cases were manually adjusted for the complex anatomy, there was agreement for all cases. Conclusion Preliminary results suggest that on further validation, breast density readings at CT may provide important additional risk information on CT of the chest and that computer-derived measurements may be helpful in such assessment. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "To determine if myeloperoxidase (MPO) is involved in epileptogenesis and if molecular nuclear imaging can be used to noninvasively map inflammatory changes in epileptogenesis.The animal and human studies were approved by the institutional review boards. Pilocarpine-induced epileptic mice were treated with 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide (n = 46), a specific irreversible MPO inhibitor, or saline (n = 42). Indium-111-bis-5-hydroxytryptamide-diethylenetriaminepentaacetate was used to image brain MPO activity (n = 6 in the 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide and saline groups; n = 5 in the sham group) by using single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography. The role of MPO in the development of spontaneous recurrent seizures was assessed by means of clinical symptoms and biochemical and histopathologic data. Human brain specimens from a patient with epilepsy and a patient without epilepsy were stained for MPO. The Student t test, one-way analysis of variance, and Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used. Differences were regarded as significant if P was less than .05.MPO and leukocytes increased in the brain during epileptogenesis (P < .05). Blocking MPO delayed spontaneous recurrent seizures (99.6 vs 142 hours, P = .016), ameliorated the severity of spontaneous recurrent seizures (P < .05), and inhibited mossy fiber sprouting (Timm index, 0.31 vs 0.03; P = .003). Matrix metalloproteinase activity was upregulated during epileptogenesis in an MPO-dependent manner (1.44 vs 0.94 U/mg, P = .049), suggesting that MPO acts upstream of matrix metalloproteinases. MPO activity was mapped during epileptogenesis in vivo in the hippocampal regions. Resected temporal lobe tissue from a human patient with refractory epilepsy but not the temporal lobe tissue from a patient without seizures demonstrated positive MPO immunostaining, suggesting high translational potential for this imaging technology.The findings of this study highlight an important role for MPO in epileptogenesis and show MPO to be a potential therapeutic target and imaging biomarker for epilepsy.",

        "Purpose To document utility of shear-wave (SW) elastography for assessing liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis B and to compare its performance with that of transient elastography. Materials and Methods Ethics committee approved the study, and informed consent was obtained. Patients with liver biopsy correlation (n = 226) and healthy patients (n = 171) were analyzed. Results of SW elastography of liver, SW elastography of spleen, and transient elastography of liver were compared and correlated according to METAVIR scores. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs), binary logistic regression, and Delong test were used. Results AUC for SW elastography of liver, transient elastography of liver, and SW elastography of spleen was, respectively, 0.86, 0.80, and 0.81 for fibrosis (\u2265F1 stage); 0.88, 0.78, and 0.82 for moderate fibrosis (\u2265F2 stage); 0.93, 0.83, and 0.83 for severe fibrosis (\u2265F3 stage); and 0.98, 0.92, and 0.84 for cirrhosis (F4 stage). SW elastography of liver showed significantly higher accuracy than transient elastography of liver and SW elastography of spleen in all fibrosis stages (P = .01\u2013.04). SW elastography of spleen showed similar accuracy with transient elastography of liver (P = .21\u2013.99). Combination SW elastography of liver and SW elastography of spleen to predict fibrosis staging showed diagnostic accuracy not further improved compared with SW elastography of liver alone (similar AUC; \u2265F1, P = .87; \u2265F2, P = .81; \u2265F3, P = .84; \u2265F4, P = .88). SW elastography of liver had higher successful rate than transient elastography of liver (98.9% vs 89.6%). Prevalence of discordance in at least two stages with liver histologic staging was 10.2% (23 of 226) for SW elastography of liver and 28.2% (58 of 206) for SW elastography of spleen. Conclusion SW elastography provides more accurate correlation of liver elasticity with liver fibrosis stage compared with transient elastography, especially in identification of stage F2 or greater. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "To determine the prevalence of demonstrable stent-graft degradation by using three-dimensional computed tomographic (CT) angiography to assess endoleak and stent-graft migration after endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR).The institutional review board approved this retrospective study. Sixty-two consecutive patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm treated with the AneuRx stent-graft (Medtronic, Santa Rosa, Calif) were assessed between 0.5 and 9.5 years after EVAR (median, 5.1 years) for the presence of broken attachment sutures and metal-ring fractures by using CT angiography. The relative risk (RR) of delayed endoleak formation and endograft migration was calculated relative to the presence of suture breaks and metal-ring fractures. A two-tailed Fisher exact test was used to assess significant differences.Suture breaks were observed in 55 of 62 subjects (89%), including 37 minor breaks (60%) and 18 major breaks (29%). Metal-ring fractures were observed in 11 of 62 subjects (18%). Twenty-seven endoleaks were observed in 24 of 62 subjects (39%) and were categorized as type I in seven of 27 (11%), type II in 16 of 27 (26%), and type III in four of 27 (6%). Major suture breaks were associated with six of seven (86%) delayed type I endoleaks (RR = 19.4, P = .003), and metal-ring fractures were associated with four of seven (57%) delayed type I endoleaks (RR = 6.2, P = .015) and three of four (75%) type III endoleaks (RR = 13.9, P = 003). Migration was observed in 15 of 62 patients (24%) and was associated with major suture breaks in 10 of 15 patients (67%, RR = 4.5, P = .001) and with metal-ring fractures in five of 11 patients (45%, RR = 4.1, P = .003). Repeat interventions were performed in 15 patients.Major suture breaks and metal-ring fractures are demonstrated with CT and are associated with delayed type I and III endoleaks and with stent-graft migration after EVAR.",
        "To prospectively assess the accuracy of contrast agent-enhanced (CE) ultrasonography (US) with a second-generation US contrast agent in the detection and classification of endoleaks after endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (EVAR), with computed tomographic (CT) angiography as the reference standard.Institutional review board and written informed consent were obtained. Thirty-five patients who underwent EVAR were enrolled in a prospective study that consisted of CT angiography and CE US studies performed at 1- and 6-month follow-up and performed yearly thereafter. CE US was performed after bolus injection of 2.4 mL of sulfur hexafluoride by using equipment with specific software for contrast studies. Angiography was performed in patients who had type II endoleaks with an increase in aneurysm sac size and in patients with type I or III endoleaks. CE US sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy were determined for endoleak detection, and Cohen \u03ba statistic was used to assess agreement of CE US and CT angiographic findings for endoleak classification.A total of 126 CT angiographic and CE US studies were performed. CT angiography depicted 34 endoleaks in 16 patients (type IA, n=1; type IB, n=1; type II inferior mesenteric artery, n=2; type II lumbar artery, n=28; type II complex, inferior mesenteric, and lumbar arteries, n=2). CE US depicted 33 endoleaks. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of CE US in endoleak detection were 97%, 100%, 100%, 98%, and 99%, respectively. CE US enabled correct classification of 26 of 33 endoleaks. No clinically important endoleak was missed at CE US.CE US yields good sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in endoleak detection, and it might represent a noninvasive tool that can be used in the follow-up of patients who undergo EVAR.",
        "Purpose To evaluate whether radiomic feature\u2013based magnetic resonance (MR) imaging signatures allow prediction of survival and stratification of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma with improved accuracy compared with that of established clinical and radiologic risk models. Materials and Methods Retrospective evaluation of data was approved by the local ethics committee and informed consent was waived. A total of 119 patients (allocated in a 2:1 ratio to a discovery [n = 79] or validation [n = 40] set) with newly diagnosed glioblastoma were subjected to radiomic feature extraction (12 190 features extracted, including first-order, volume, shape, and texture features) from the multiparametric (contrast material\u2013enhanced T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery imaging sequences) and multiregional (contrast-enhanced and unenhanced) tumor volumes. Radiomic features of patients in the discovery set were subjected to a supervised principal component (SPC) analysis to predict progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) and were validated in the validation set. The performance of a Cox proportional hazards model with the SPC analysis predictor was assessed with C index and integrated Brier scores (IBS, lower scores indicating higher accuracy) and compared with Cox models based on clinical (age and Karnofsky performance score) and radiologic (Gaussian normalized relative cerebral blood volume and apparent diffusion coefficient) parameters. Results SPC analysis allowed stratification based on 11 features of patients in the discovery set into a low- or high-risk group for PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 2.43; P = .002) and OS (HR, 4.33; P < .001), and the results were validated successfully in the validation set for PFS (HR, 2.28; P = .032) and OS (HR, 3.45; P = .004). The performance of the SPC analysis (OS: IBS, 0.149; C index, 0.654; PFS: IBS, 0.138; C index, 0.611) was higher compared with that of the radiologic (OS: IBS, 0.175; C index, 0.603; PFS: IBS, 0.149; C index, 0.554) and clinical risk models (OS: IBS, 0.161, C index, 0.640; PFS: IBS, 0.139; C index, 0.599). The performance of the SPC analysis model was further improved when combined with clinical data (OS: IBS, 0.142; C index, 0.696; PFS: IBS, 0.132; C index, 0.637). Conclusion An 11-feature radiomic signature that allows prediction of survival and stratification of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma was identified, and improved performance compared with that of established clinical and radiologic risk models was demonstrated. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "The overlap of early Ebola virus disease (EVD) symptoms (eg, fever, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, emesis, and fatigue) with symptoms of other more common travel-related diseases (eg, malaria, typhoid fever, pneumonia, and meningococcemia) may result in delayed diagnosis of EVD before isolation of infected patients. Radiology departments should consider policies for and approaches to decontamination of expensive and potentially easily damaged radiology equipment. In addition, the protection of radiology personnel must be considered during the work-up phase of undiagnosed EVD patients presenting to emergency departments. The purpose of this article is to consider the effect of EVD on radiology departments and imaging equipment, with particular consideration of guidelines currently available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that may be applicable to radiology.",
        "Purpose To study the relationship between functional independence and time to reperfusion in the Solitaire with the Intention for Thrombectomy as Primary Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke (SWIFT PRIME) trial in patients with disabling acute ischemic stroke who underwent endovascular therapy plus intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) administration versus tPA administration alone and to investigate variables that affect time spent during discrete steps. Materials and Methods Data were analyzed from the SWIFT PRIME trial, a global, multicenter, prospective study in which outcomes were compared in patients treated with intravenous tPA alone or in combination with the Solitaire device (Covidien, Irvine, Calif). Between December 2012 and November 2014, 196 patients were enrolled. The relation between time from (a) symptom onset to reperfusion and (b) imaging to reperfusion and clinical outcome was analyzed, along with patient and health system characteristics that affect discrete steps in patient workflow. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess relationships between time and outcome; negative binomial regression was used to evaluate effects on workflow. The institutional review board at each site approved the trial. Patients provided written informed consent, or, at select sites, there was an exception from having to acquire explicit informed consent in emergency circumstances. Results In the stent retriever arm of the study, symptom onset to reperfusion time of 150 minutes led to 91% estimated probability of functional independence, which decreased by 10% over the next hour and by 20% with every subsequent hour of delay. Time from arrival at the emergency department to arterial access was 90 minutes (interquartile range, 69\u2013120 minutes), and time to reperfusion was 129 minutes (interquartile range, 108\u2013169 minutes). Patients who initially arrived at a referring facility had longer symptom onset to groin puncture times compared with patients who presented directly to the endovascular-capable center (275 vs 179.5 minutes, P < .001). Conclusion Fast reperfusion leads to improved functional outcome among patients with acute stroke treated with stent retrievers. Detailed attention to workflow with iterative feedback and aggressive time goals may have contributed to efficient workflow environments. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To investigate the effect of change in portal vein flow rates on the size and shape of ablations created by a bipolar radiofrequency (RF) ablation device. Materials and Methods This study was exempt from institutional animal care and use committee review. An in vitro bovine liver model perfused with autologous blood via the portal vein at three flow rates (60, 80, 100 mL/min per 100 g of liver) was used. Four ablations, two bipolar and two monopolar (control probe), were made in each of five livers perfused at each flow rate. Short- and long-axis diameters were measured from gross specimens, and volume and sphericity index were calculated for each ablation. A general linear mixed model accounting for correlation within the liver was used to evaluate the effects of flow on ablations. Analyses were performed by using software. Results There was no significant difference in the size or shape of ablations created by the bipolar device at the different flow rates (P > .05 for all outcomes). The monopolar device demonstrated the expected inverse association between ablation size and change in flow (P < .01 for all outcomes). The mean \u00b1 standard deviation of short-axis diameter, long-axis diameter, volume, and sphericity index of the bipolar ablations was 4.3 cm \u00b1 0.1, 4.2 cm \u00b1 0.1, 41.0 cm3 \u00b1 1.8, and 1.1 \u00b1 0.1, respectively. Conclusion Unlike monopolar RF ablation, change in portal vein flow rates does not have a statistically significant effect on the size or shape of ablations created by the bipolar RF ablation device tested. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016.",
        "Purpose To investigate the diagnostic accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC]) of magnetic resonance (MR) elastography for the early detection of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) among patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Materials and Methods An institutional review board\u2013approved and HIPAA-compliant retrospective study was conducted in 58 NAFLD patients. Informed consent was waived by the review board. Hepatic stiffness, relative fat fraction, inflammation grade, and fibrosis stage were assessed from MR elastography, in-phase and out-of-phase gradient-echo imaging, and liver biopsy histopathologic review, respectively. Pairwise t testing, receiver operating characteristic analysis, and partial correlation analysis were performed. Results The mean hepatic stiffness for patients with simple steatosis (2.51 kPa) was less (P = .028) than that for patients with inflammation but no fibrosis (3.24 kPa). The mean hepatic stiffness for patients with inflammation but no fibrosis was less (P = .030) than that for patients with hepatic fibrosis (4.16 kPa). Liver stiffness had high accuracy (AUROC = 0.93) for discriminating patients with NASH from those with simple steatosis, with a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity 73% by using a threshold of 2.74 kPa. Conclusion In patients with NAFLD, hepatic stiffness measurements with MR elastography can help identify individuals with steatohepatitis, even before the onset of fibrosis; NAFLD patients with inflammation but no fibrosis have greater liver stiffness than those with simple steatosis and lower mean stiffness than those with fibrosis. \u00a9 RSNA, 2011",
        "Owing to recent advances in computing power, iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms have become a clinically viable option in computed tomographic (CT) imaging. Substantial evidence is accumulating about the advantages of IR algorithms over established analytical methods, such as filtered back projection. IR improves image quality through cyclic image processing. Although all available solutions share the common mechanism of artifact reduction and/or potential for radiation dose savings, chiefly due to image noise suppression, the magnitude of these effects depends on the specific IR algorithm. In the first section of this contribution, the technical bases of IR are briefly reviewed and the currently available algorithms released by the major CT manufacturers are described. In the second part, the current status of their clinical implementation is surveyed. Regardless of the applied IR algorithm, the available evidence attests to the substantial potential of IR algorithms for overcoming traditional limitations in CT imaging.",
        "To outline the conceptual development of dual-energy absorptiometric (DXA) region-free analysis, quantify its precision, and evaluate its application to quantify the change in longitudinal femoral periprosthetic bone mineral density (BMD) in patients during the 12 months after total hip arthroplasty.All subjects had undergone total hip arthroplasty for idiopathic arthritis, and the scans were collected as part of previous ethically approved studies (1998-2005) for which informed consent was provided. Contemporary image processing approaches were used to develop a region of interest-free DXA analysis method with increased spatial resolution for assessment of proximal femoral BMD. The method was calibrated, and its accuracy relative to a proprietary algorithm was assessed by using a hip phantom. The precision of the method was examined by using repeat DXA acquisitions in 29 patients, and its ability to allow spatial resolution of localized periprosthetic BMD change at the hip was assessed in an independent group of 19 patients who were measured throughout a 12-month period. Differences were evaluated with t tests (P < .05).The method allowed spatial resolution of more than 10 000 individual BMD data points on a typical archived prosthetic hip scan. The median data point-level error of the method after calibration was -1.9% (interquartile range, -7.2% to 3.5%) relative to a proprietary algorithm. The median data point-level precision, expressed as a coefficient of variation, was 1.4% (interquartile range, 1.2%-1.6%). Evaluation of BMD change in a model of periprosthetic bone loss demonstrated large but highly focal changes in BMD that would not be resolved by using traditional region of interest-based analysis approaches.The proposed approach provides a quantitative, precise method for extracting high-spatial-resolution BMD data from existing DXA datasets without the limitations imposed by region of interest-based analysis.",
        "Purpose To perform external validation of a computer-assisted registration algorithm for prone and supine computed tomographic (CT) colonography and to compare the results with those of an existing centerline method. Materials and Methods All contributing centers had institutional review board approval; participants provided informed consent. A validation sample of CT colonographic examinations of 51 patients with 68 polyps (6\u201355 mm) was selected from a publicly available, HIPAA compliant, anonymized archive. No patients were excluded because of poor preparation or inadequate distension. Corresponding prone and supine polyp coordinates were recorded, and endoluminal surfaces were registered automatically by using a computer algorithm. Two observers independently scored three-dimensional endoluminal polyp registration success. Results were compared with those obtained by using the normalized distance along the colonic centerline (NDACC) method. Pairwise Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used to compare gross registration error and McNemar tests were used to compare polyp conspicuity. Results Registration was possible in all 51 patients, and 136 paired polyp coordinates were generated (68 polyps) to test the algorithm. Overall mean three-dimensional polyp registration error (mean \u00b1 standard deviation, 19.9 mm \u00b1 20.4) was significantly less than that for the NDACC method (mean, 27.4 mm \u00b1 15.1; P = .001). Accuracy was unaffected by colonic segment (P = .76) or luminal collapse (P = .066). During endoluminal review by two observers (272 matching tasks, 68 polyps, prone to supine and supine to prone coordinates), 223 (82%) polyp matches were visible (120\u00b0 field of view) compared with just 129 (47%) when the NDACC method was used (P < .001). By using multiplanar visualization, 48 (70%) polyps were visible after scrolling \u00b1 15 mm in any multiplanar axis compared with 16 (24%) for NDACC (P < .001). Conclusion Computer-assisted registration is more accurate than the NDACC method for mapping the endoluminal surface and matching the location of polyps in corresponding prone and supine CT colonographic acquisitions. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.13122083/-/DC1",
        "To investigate the change of breast density with quantitative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the contralateral normal breast of patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy.This study was approved by the institutional review board and was HIPAA compliant. Informed consent was obtained. Fifty-four patients with breast cancer (mean age, 47 years; age range, 30-74 years) treated with NAC protocol and enrolled in a breast MR imaging research study were studied. The density in the contralateral normal breast was analyzed by using an MR imaging-based segmentation method. The effect of chemotherapy on the change of density following the doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) and the AC and taxane regimen was evaluated. The dependence on age was investigated by using a multivariate regression model.In patients who underwent both AC and taxane follow-up, the mean percentage of change from the individual's baseline density was -10% (95% confidence interval: -12.8%, -7.2%) after AC and -12.7% (95% confidence interval: -16%, -9.4%) after AC and taxane. In patients who underwent both follow-up studies after one to two and four cycles of AC, the mean percentage of change was -9.4% (95% confidence interval: -13.5%, -5.3%) after one to two cycles of AC and -14.7% (95% confidence interval: -20.6%, -8.7%) after four cycles of AC. The percentage reduction of density was significantly dependent on age. Patients younger than 40 years had a greater reduction after chemotherapy than patients older than 55 years (P = .01).By using three-dimensional MR imaging, patients receiving chemotherapy showed reduction of breast density, and the effects were significant after initial treatment with one to two cycles of the AC regimen.",
        "Purpose To characterize the progression of healing across aneurysm necks following treatment with a flow diverter in a rabbit aneurysm model. Materials and Methods With institutional animal care and use committee approval, saccular aneurysms were created in 20 rabbits and treated with flow diverters. On days 1, 3, and 7 and weeks 4 and 8 after implantation, the aneurysm and the device-implanted vessel were harvested. En face staining of the gross specimen was performed for endothelial cells, endothelial progenitor cells, smooth muscle cells, and inflammatory cells. Results The parent artery segments covered by the flow diverters were completely devoid of endothelial cells at 1 and 3 days but had completely reendothelialized by 7 days. At all time points, the struts along the patent portions of the aneurysm necks harbored scattered tissue islands composed exclusively of inflammatory cells. At 4 and 8 weeks, all samples contiguous with the tissue along the parent arteries had translucent tissue present along the occluded segments of the aneurysm neck. The vast majority of endothelial cells were contiguous with the parent artery and had smooth muscle cells underlying them. Endothelial progenitor cells were not observed along the neck of any aneurysm. Aneurysm closure was noted only when complete or nearly complete endothelialization over the device struts was present. Conclusion The initial event following flow diversion treatment is adherence of clusters of inflammatory cells across the aneurysm neck. Endothelialization is relatively delayed and derived exclusively from cells in the adjacent parent artery. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",

A peripheral blood smear revealed anemia, thrombocytopenia, and blast cells, and a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia was made. Immunohistochemistry revealed positivity for cluster of differentiation (or CD) markers, which have been reported to be associated with an increased risk of extramedullary leukemic involvement. Thus, contrast material-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis was requested to enable exclusion of any extramedullary extension of leukemia. Unenhanced and contrast-enhanced nephrographic phase CT was performed. Follow-up CT 3 months later showed minimal interval change in the lesion (images not shown).",
        "To assess the frequency of hyperintensity in the dentate nucleus on T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images and to establish correlations between such hyperintensity and clinical factors, including a history of brain irradiation.This study was approved by the institutional review board, and each patient provided written informed consent. Three hundred sixty-two patients (164 men, 198 women; mean age, 62 years) were evaluated. Unenhanced T1-weighted MR images were obtained by using a spin-echo sequence at 3.0 T. Two neuroradiologists, who were blinded to clinical data, independently evaluated the signal intensity of the dentate nucleus compared with the signal intensity of the central white matter of the cerebellum by using a four-point graded response scale (grade 4 indicated prominent hyperintensity; grade 3, faint hyperintensity; grade 2, isointensity; and grade 1, hypointensity). Backward stepwise regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between signal intensity grades and the following clinical factors: sex, age, the interaction between age and sex, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, liver dysfunction, brain infarction, brain tumor, spinocerebellar degeneration, multiple sclerosis, a history of chemotherapy, and a history of brain irradiation.T1-hyperintense dentate nuclei were present in 41 (11%) of the 362 patients. Of these 41 patients, 31 (76%) had a history of brain irradiation. Signal intensity grade of the dentate nucleus on T1-weighted MR images correlated significantly with a history of brain irradiation (P < .001) but no other clinical factor.A hyperintense dentate nucleus may be seen on unenhanced T1-weighted MR images in some patients and may be associated with a history of brain irradiation.",
        "To investigate whether there is any correlation between standard efficacy endpoints-specifically, tumor response, progression-free survival, and overall survival-and tumor perfusion parameters measured by using dynamic contrast material-enhanced ultrasonography (US) in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with bevacizumab.The institutional review board approved the study, and all patients provided written informed consent before their enrollment. Between June 3, 2005, and September 28, 2007, 42 patients (33 men, nine women; median age, 62 years; age range, 23-84 years) participated in this phase II study of single-agent bevacizumab treatment. Tumor response (based on RECIST [response evaluation criteria in solid tumors]) at 2 months was assessed in 37 patients, and progression-free survival and overall survival were assessed in all 42 patients. Dynamic contrast-enhanced US (ie, dynamic US) was performed before treatment (day 0); on days 3, 7, 14, and 60 after treatment; and every 2 months thereafter. Tumor perfusion parameters were estimated quantitatively from contrast material uptake curves constructed from raw linear data. The changes in dynamic US functional parameters between day 0 and the later time points were compared between treatment responders and nonresponders by using nonparametric tests. Given multiple comparisons, P < .001 indicated significance.The percentage decrease in several dynamic US parameters between day 0 and day 3 showed trends toward correlation with (a) tumor response in terms of total area under the time-intensity curve (AUC) (P = .02), AUC during wash in (P = .04), AUC during washout (P = .02), and time to peak intensity (P = .03); (b) progression-free survival in terms of time to peak intensity (P = .028); and (c) overall survival in terms of AUC (P = .002) and AUC during washout (P = .003).Dynamic US can be used to quantify dynamic changes in tumor vascularity as early as 3 days after bevacizumab administration in patients with HCC. These early changes in tumor perfusion may be predictive of tumor response at 2 months, progression-free survival, and overall survival, and they may be potential surrogate measures of the effectiveness of antiangiogenic therapy in patients with HCC.",
        "To assess procedural aspects, diagnostic adequacy, and accuracy of liver biopsy across the United Kingdom.Institutional review board approval for this type of study is not required in the United Kingdom. All radiology departments with an approved leader for departmental audit registered with the Royal College of Radiologists were invited to participate in this retrospective audit. The first 50 consecutive patients who underwent image-guided or image-assisted liver biopsy in 2008 were included. Audit standards relating to procedural aspects of biopsy, sample adequacy, and accuracy were prepared with reference to published data. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios, and accuracy were calculated. Organizational and clinical variables were investigated for their association with diagnostic specimen quality.Eighty-seven (41%) of 210 departments supplied data for this study, with a total of 3496 cases (1225 focal disease, 2262 nonfocal disease, nine unspecified). Ultrasonographic (US) guidance was the technique most commonly used for focal lesions and for cases of nonfocal disease (2808 [96.38%] of 3490 cases). The audit standard for sample adequacy (98%) was narrowly missed in practice (3401 [97.96%] of 3472 cases); however, the standard for diagnostic accuracy (90%) was met (3187 [98.55%] of 3234 cases). Poor compliance with postbiopsy documentation was observed.The majority of liver biopsies in this audit were performed by radiologists using image guidance or assistance, usually in the form of US. Biopsies were performed with a high degree of accuracy. Some postprocedural aspects of biopsy failed to meet required standards and would merit reaudit after practice changes.http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.12111562/-/DC1.",
        "To evaluate the potential of diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map in the prediction of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer.This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board, which waived the informed consent requirement. Fifty-three consecutive women (mean age, 43.7 years; median age, 42.0 years; age range, 24-65 years) with 53 invasive breast cancers (mean diameter, 5.0 cm; median diameter, 4.2 cm; diameter range, 2.0-13.3 cm) who had undergone chemotherapy were included. Both DW MR imaging (b values, 0 and 750 sec/mm(2)) and dynamic contrast material-enhanced (DCE) MR imaging were performed at 1.5 T before and after chemotherapy prior to surgery. Mean time from initiation of chemotherapy to posttreatment ADC measurement was 54 days (range, 48-62 days). Average ADC for three regions of interest per tumor on ADC maps was calculated. Patients with a reduction in tumor diameter of at least 30% after chemotherapy at DCE MR imaging were defined as responders. Pretreatment ADCs and percentage increases in ADC after chemotherapy in responders and nonresponders were compared. The best pretreatment ADC cutoff with which to differentiate between responders and nonresponders was calculated with receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.After chemotherapy, 36 (68%) patients were classified as responders, and 17 (32%) were classified as nonresponders. Pretreatment mean ADC ([1.036 \u00b1 0.015] \u00d7 10(-3) mm(2)/sec [standard error]) of responders was significantly lower than that of nonresponders ([1.299 \u00b1 0.079] \u00d7 10(-3) mm(2)/sec) (P = .004). Furthermore, mean percentage ADC increase of responders (47.9% \u00b1 4.8) was higher than that of nonresponders (18.1% \u00b1 4.5) (P < .001). The best pretreatment ADC cutoff with which to differentiate between responders and nonresponders was 1.17 \u00d7 10(-3) mm(2)/sec, which yielded a sensitivity of 94% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 81%, 99%) and a specificity of 71% (95% CI: 44%, 90%).Patients with breast cancer and a low pretreatment ADC tended to respond better to chemotherapy. Prediction of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy with DW MR imaging might help physicians individualize treatments and avoid ineffective chemotherapy.",
        "To identify prognostic imaging biomarkers in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by means of a radiogenomics strategy that integrates gene expression and medical images in patients for whom survival outcomes are not available by leveraging survival data in public gene expression data sets.A radiogenomics strategy for associating image features with clusters of coexpressed genes (metagenes) was defined. First, a radiogenomics correlation map is created for a pairwise association between image features and metagenes. Next, predictive models of metagenes are built in terms of image features by using sparse linear regression. Similarly, predictive models of image features are built in terms of metagenes. Finally, the prognostic significance of the predicted image features are evaluated in a public gene expression data set with survival outcomes. This radiogenomics strategy was applied to a cohort of 26 patients with NSCLC for whom gene expression and 180 image features from computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET)/CT were available.There were 243 statistically significant pairwise correlations between image features and metagenes of NSCLC. Metagenes were predicted in terms of image features with an accuracy of 59%-83%. One hundred fourteen of 180 CT image features and the PET standardized uptake value were predicted in terms of metagenes with an accuracy of 65%-86%. When the predicted image features were mapped to a public gene expression data set with survival outcomes, tumor size, edge shape, and sharpness ranked highest for prognostic significance.This radiogenomics strategy for identifying imaging biomarkers may enable a more rapid evaluation of novel imaging modalities, thereby accelerating their translation to personalized medicine.",
        "Purpose To evaluate the safety and efficacy of microwave ablation (MWA) in patients with end-stage renal disease and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Materials and Methods The study protocol was approved by the human ethics review committee. Between March 1, 2014, and June 30, 2015, 51 patients (25 men, 26 women; mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 53.1 years \u00b1 12.9) were enrolled. All patients had at least one enlarged parathyroid gland and secondary symptomatic hyperparathyroidism, which was treated with ultrasonographically (US) guided MWA. The levels of intact parathyroid hormone, serum calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase were compared before and after MWA. Paired-sample t tests and paired-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare treatment outcomes before and after MWA. Results Complete ablation was achieved in all 96 glands in 51 of 120 patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism. The mean follow-up time was 11.1 months \u00b1 3.3. The maximum diameter of the glands ranged from 0.5 cm to 4.8 cm (mean, 1.5 cm \u00b1 0.6). The ablation time for each gland was 216.1 seconds \u00b1 130.1. The mean serum intact parathyroid hormone, calcium, and phosphorus levels after MWA (400 pg/mL [400 ng/L; range, 151.3\u2013629.0 ng/L], 2.33 mmol/L \u00b1 0.23, and 1.54 mmol/L \u00b1 0.43, respectively) were significantly lower than those before MWA (1203 pg/mL [1203 ng/L; range, 854.7\u20131694.5 ng/L], 2.53 mmol/L \u00b1 0.24, and 1.97 mmol/L \u00b1 0.50, respectively; P < .01), while the alkaline phosphatase levels did not change with MWA (P > .05). Ipsilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve injury was seen in one patient (2%). A hematoma developed during one procedure in one patient (2%) and was treated successfully with injection of thrombin. Conclusion US-guided MWA is safe and effective for destroying parathyroid gland tissue in patients with end-stage renal disease and severe secondary hyperparathyroidism. Further experience with the technique is clearly necessary. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016",
        "To explore the neural correlates of the thalamus by using resting-state functional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and to investigate whether thalamic resting-state networks (RSNs) are disrupted in patients with mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI).This HIPAA-compliant study was approved by the institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained from 24 patients with MTBI and 17 healthy control subjects. The patients had varying degrees of symptoms, with a mean disease duration of 22 days. The resting-state functional MR imaging data were analyzed by using a standard seed-based whole-brain correlation method to characterize thalamic RSNs. Student t tests were used to perform comparisons. The association between thalamic RSNs and performance on neuropsychologic and neurobehavioral measures was also investigated in patients with MTBI by using Spearman rank correlation.A normal pattern of thalamic RSNs was demonstrated in healthy subjects. This pattern was characterized as representing relatively symmetric and restrictive functional thalamocortical connectivity, suggesting an inhibitory property of the thalamic neurons during the resting state. This pattern was disrupted, with significantly increased thalamic RSNs (P \u2264 .005) and decreased symmetry (P = .03) in patients with MTBI compared with healthy control subjects. Increased functional thalamocortical redistributive connectivity was correlated with diminished neurocognitive functions and clinical symptoms in patients with MTBI.These findings of abnormal thalamic RSNs lend further support to the presumed subtle thalamic injury in patients with MTBI. Resting-state functional MR imaging can be used as an additional imaging modality for detection of thalamocortical connectivity abnormalities and for better understanding of the complex persistent postconcussive syndrome.",
        "To evaluate subclinical atherosclerosis measured by using coronary artery calcium (CAC) as a predictor of future left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function in asymptomatic elderly participants.The institutional review boards of the University of Southern California and the Harbor University of California Los Angeles Research and Education Institute (where the South Bay Heart Watch study was initially conducted) approved this HIPAA-compliant study of 386 participants (mean age, 75.2 years) from among the original 1461 participants in the longitudinal South Bay Heart Watch prospective investigation of subclinical atherosclerosis. CAC at computed tomography was correlated with LV ejection fraction (LVEF), regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMAs), and peak filling rate (PFR) assessed a mean of 11.4 years \u00b1 0.6 (standard deviation) later with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Analysis of variance and covariance testing was performed with the Wald test, testing for trends across the CAC groups. Covariates included age, level of total cholesterol, level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, use of lipid-lowering medication, and smoking status.Mean LVEF was 60.3% \u00b1 9.9, with 11 (2.8%) of 386 participants having an LVEF of less than 40%. Forty-six (11.9%) of 386 participants had RWMAs. Higher CAC scores were associated with slightly lower LVEF (P for trend = .04) and a greater percentage of participants with decreased PFR (P for trend = .47) and RWMAs (P for trend = .01). After age- and risk factor-adjustment, only RWMA (P = .05) was associated with higher CAC. RWMAs were associated with significantly (P < .001) lower mean LVEF and PFR. Nineteen (41%) of 46 participants with RWMAs had documented Q-wave myocardial infarction, and three (7%) underwent coronary revascularization. CAC scores of 100 or greater were associated with a 2.2-fold (95% confidence interval: 1.30, 3.75) increase in RWMA (P < .001).Subclinical atherosclerosis assessed by using CAC is associated with an increased future likelihood of RWMA, as a marker of previous and possible subclinical coronary artery disease.",
        "To evaluate the midterm clinical and angiographic outcomes after pipeline embolization device (PED) placement for treatment of intracranial aneurysms.This prospective nonrandomized multicenter study was approved by the review boards of all involved centers; informed consent was obtained. Patients (143 patients, 178 aneurysms) with unruptured saccular or fusiform aneurysms or recurrent aneurysms after previous treatment were included and observed angiographically for up to 18 months and clinically for up to 3 years. Study endpoints included complete aneurysm occlusion; neurologic complications within 30 days and up to 3 years; clinical outcome of cranial nerve palsy after PED placement; angiographic evidence of occlusion or stenosis of parent artery and that of occlusion of covered side branches at 6, 12, and 18 months; and clinical and computed tomographic evidence of perforator infarction.There were five (3.5%) cases of periprocedural death or major stroke (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] > 3) (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3%, 8.4%), including two posttreatment delayed ruptures, two intracerebral hemorrhages, and one thromboembolism. Five (3.5%) patients had minor neurologic complications within 30 days (mRS = 1) (95% CI: 1.3%, 8.4%), including transient ischemic attack (n = 2), small cerebral infarction (n = 2), and cranial nerve palsy (n = 1). Beyond 30 days, there was one fatal intracerebral hemorrhage and one transient ischemic attack. Ten of 13 patients (95% CI: 46%, 93.8%) completely recovered from symptoms of cranial nerve palsy within a median of 3.5 months. Angiographic results at 18 months revealed a complete aneurysm occlusion rate of 84% (49 of 58; 95% CI: 72.1%, 92.2%), with no cases of parent artery occlusion, parent artery stenosis (<50%) in three patients, and occlusion of a covered side branch in two cases (posterior communicating arteries). Perforator infarction did not occur.PED placement is a reasonably safe and effective treatment for intracranial aneurysms. The treatment is promising for aneurysms of unfavorable morphologic features, such as wide neck, large size, fusiform morphology, incorporation of side branches, and posttreatment recanalization, and should be considered a first choice for treating unruptured aneurysms and recurrent aneurysms after previous treatments.http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.12120422/-/DC1.",
        "To prospectively evaluate radiation and contrast medium requirements for performing high-pitch coronary computed tomographic (CT) angiography at 70 kV using a third-generation dual-source CT system in comparison to a second-generation dual-source CT system.All patients gave informed consent for this institutional review board-approved study. Forty-five patients (median age, 52 years; 27 men) were imaged in high-pitch mode with a third-generation dual-source CT system at 70 kV (n = 15) or with a second-generation dual-source CT system at 80 or 100 kV (n = 15 for each). Tube voltage was based on body mass index: 80 or 70 kV for less than 26 kg/m(2) versus 100 kV for 26-30 kg/m(2). For the 80- and 100-kV protocols, 80 mL of contrast material was injected, versus 45 mL for the 70-kV protocol. Data were reconstructed by using a second-generation iterative reconstruction algorithm for second-generation dual-source CT and a recently introduced third-generation iterative reconstruction algorithm for third-generation dual-source CT. Objective image quality was measured for various regions of interest, and subjective image quality was evaluated with a five-point Likert scale.The signal-to-noise ratio of the coronary CT angiography studies acquired with 70 kV was significantly higher (70 kV: 14.3-17.6 vs 80 kV: 7.1-12.9 vs 100 kV: 9.8-12.9; P < .0497) than those acquired with the other two protocols for all coronary arteries. Qualitative image quality analyses revealed no significant differences between the three CT angiography protocols (median score, 5; P > .05). The mean effective dose was 75% and 108% higher (0.92 mSv \u00b1 0.3 [standard deviation] and 0.78 mSv \u00b1 0.2 vs 0.44 mSv \u00b1 0.1; P < .0001), respectively, for the 80- and 100-kV CT angiography protocols than for the 70-kV CT angiography protocol.In nonobese patients, third-generation high-pitch coronary dual-source CT angiography at 70 kV results in robust image quality for studying the coronary arteries, at significantly reduced radiation dose (0.44 mSv) and contrast medium volume (45 mL), thus enabling substantial radiation dose and contrast medium savings as compared with second-generation dual-source CT.",
        "To estimate the correlation between the negative appendectomy rate (NAR) and the rate of preoperative computed tomography (CT) in patients suspected of having acute appendicitis who presented to the emergency department during an 18-year period.This retrospective institutional review board-approved, HIPAA-compliant study was performed in a 719-bed tertiary care adult teaching hospital with 58,000 annual emergency department visits. The authors obtained a waiver of informed consent and used the medical records system to compare patients suspected of having appendicitis who presented to the emergency department between 2003 and 2007 to those who presented between 1990 and 1994, the period just before CT became commonly used at the authors' institution for the evaluation of appendicitis. Surgical and pathology reports were reviewed to determine the NAR, and the authors queried the radiology databases to determine the proportion of appendectomy patients who underwent preoperative imaging. Outcome measures included the NAR, the proportion of appendectomy patients who underwent preoperative CT, and the annual number of appendectomies performed. The chi(2) test for trend was used to assess for changes in proportions, and linear regression was used to evaluate numeric trends.From 1990 to 2007, the NAR decreased significantly from 23.0% to 1.7% (P < .0001), the annual number of appendectomies decreased significantly from 217 per year to 119 per year (P = .0003), and the proportion of patients undergoing appendectomy who underwent preoperative CT increased significantly from 1% to 97.5% (P < .0001).There was a significant reduction in both the NAR and the number of appendectomies in patients who presented to the emergency department during an 18-year period, which was associated with a significant increase in the use of preoperative abdominal CT.",
        "Purpose To determine the association between tumor heterogeneity, morphologic tumor response, and overall survival in primary esophageal cancer treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy (CRT). Materials and Methods After an institutional review board waiver was obtained, contrast material\u2013enhanced computed tomographic (CT) studies in 36 patients with stage T2 or greater esophageal tumors who underwent contrast-enhanced CT before and after CRT between 2005 and 2008 were analyzed in terms of whole-tumor texture, with quantification of entropy, uniformity, mean gray-level intensity, kurtosis, standard deviation of the histogram, and skewness for fine to coarse textures (filters 1.0\u20132.5, respectively). The association between texture parameters and survival time was assessed by using Kaplan-Meier analysis and a Cox proportional hazards model. Survival models involving texture parameters and combinations of texture and morphologic response assessment were compared with morphologic assessment alone by means of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results Posttreatment medium entropy of less than 7.356 (median overall survival, 33.2 vs 11.7 months; P = .0002), coarse entropy of less than 7.116 (median overall survival, 33.2 vs 11.7 months; P = .0002), and medium uniformity of 0.007 or greater (median overall survival, 33.2 vs 11.7 months; P = .0002) were associated with improved survival time. These remained significant prognostic factors after adjustment for stage and age: entropy (filter 2.0: hazard ratio [HR] = 5.038, P = .0004; filter 2.5: HR = 5.038, P = .0004) and uniformity (HR = 0.199, P = .0004). Survival models that included a combination of pretreatment entropy and uniformity with maximal wall thickness assessment, respectively, performed better than morphologic assessment alone (area under the ROC curve, 0.767 vs 0.487 [P = .00005] and 0.802 vs 0.487 [P = .0003]). Conclusion Posttreatment texture parameters are associated with survival time, and the combination of pretreatment texture parameters and maximal wall thickness performed better in survival models than morphologic tumor response alone. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To determine the interobserver reproducibility of the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 2 lexicon. Materials and Methods This retrospective HIPAA-compliant study was institutional review board\u2013approved. Six radiologists from six separate institutions, all experienced in prostate magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, assessed prostate MR imaging examinations performed at a single center by using the PI-RADS lexicon. Readers were provided screen captures that denoted the location of one specific lesion per case. Analysis entailed two sessions (40 and 80 examinations per session) and an intersession training period for individualized feedback and group discussion. Percent agreement (fraction of pairwise reader combinations with concordant readings) was compared between sessions. \u03ba coefficients were computed. Results No substantial difference in interobserver agreement was observed between sessions, and the sessions were subsequently pooled. Agreement for PI-RADS score of 4 or greater was 0.593 in peripheral zone (PZ) and 0.509 in transition zone (TZ). In PZ, reproducibility was moderate to substantial for features related to diffusion-weighted imaging (\u03ba = 0.535\u20130.619); fair to moderate for features related to dynamic contrast material\u2013enhanced (DCE) imaging (\u03ba = 0.266\u20130.439); and fair for definite extraprostatic extension on T2-weighted images (\u03ba = 0.289). In TZ, reproducibility for features related to lesion texture and margins on T2-weighted images ranged from 0.136 (moderately hypointense) to 0.529 (encapsulation). Among 63 lesions that underwent targeted biopsy, classification as PI-RADS score of 4 or greater by a majority of readers yielded tumor with a Gleason score of 3+4 or greater in 45.9% (17 of 37), without missing any tumor with a Gleason score of 3+4 or greater. Conclusion Experienced radiologists achieved moderate reproducibility for PI-RADS version 2, and neither required nor benefitted from a training session. Agreement tended to be better in PZ than TZ, although was weak for DCE in PZ. The findings may help guide future PI-RADS lexicon updates. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To investigate the use of photoacoustic (PA) spectrum analysis (PASA) to identify microstructural changes corresponding to fat accumulation in mouse livers ex vivo and in situ.The laboratory animal protocol for this work was approved by the university committee on use and care of animals. Six mice with normal livers and six mice with fatty livers were examined ex vivo with a PA system at 1200 nm, and nine similar pairs of mice were examined at 532 nm. To explore the feasibility of this technique for future study in an in vivo mouse model, an additional pair of normal and fatty mouse livers was scanned in situ with an ultrasonographic (US) and PA dual-modality imaging system. The PA signals acquired were analyzed by using the proposed PASA method. Results of the groups were compared by using the Student t test.Prominent differences between the PASA parameters from the fatty and normal mouse livers were observed. The analysis of the PASA parameters from six normal and six fatty mouse livers indicates that there are differences of up to 5 standard deviations between the PASA parameters of the normal livers and those of the fatty livers at 1200 nm; for parameters from nine normal and nine fatty mouse livers at 532 nm, the differences were approximately 2 standard deviations (P < .05) for each PASA parameter.The results supported our hypothesis that the PASA allows quantitative identification of the microstructural changes that differentiate normal from fatty livers. Compared with that at 532 nm, PASA at 1200 nm is more reliable for fatty liver diagnosis. Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To validate whether repeated magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-guided focused ultrasound treatments targeted to the hippocampus, a brain structure relevant for Alzheimer disease ( AD Alzheimer disease ), could modulate pathologic abnormalities, plasticity, and behavior in a mouse model.All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Care Committee and are in accordance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Seven-month-old transgenic (TgCRND8) (Tg) mice and their nontransgenic (non-Tg) littermates were entered in the study. Mice were treated weekly with MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound in the bilateral hippocampus (1.68 MHz, 10-msec bursts, 1-Hz burst repetition frequency, 120-second total duration). After 1 month, spatial memory was tested in the Y maze with the novel arm prior to sacrifice and immunohistochemical analysis. The data were compared by using unpaired t tests and analysis of variance with Tukey post hoc analysis.Untreated Tg mice spent 61% less time than untreated non-Tg mice exploring the novel arm of the Y maze because of spatial memory impairments (P < .05). Following MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound, Tg mice spent 99% more time exploring the novel arm, performing as well as their non-Tg littermates. Changes in behavior were correlated with a reduction of the number and size of amyloid plaques in the MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound-treated animals (P < .01). Further, after MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound treatment, there was a 250% increase in the number of newborn neurons in the hippocampus (P < .01). The newborn neurons had longer dendrites and more arborization after MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound, as well (P < .01).Repeated MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound treatments led to spatial memory improvement in a Tg mouse model of AD Alzheimer disease . The behavior changes may be mediated by decreased amyloid pathologic abnormalities and increased neuronal plasticity.",
        "Purpose To identify quantitative imaging biomarkers at fluorine 18 ((18)F) positron emission tomography (PET) for predicting distant metastasis in patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Materials and Methods In this institutional review board-approved HIPAA-compliant retrospective study, the pretreatment (18)F fluorodeoxyglucose PET images in 101 patients treated with stereotactic ablative radiation therapy from 2005 to 2013 were analyzed. Data for 70 patients who were treated before 2011 were used for discovery purposes, while data from the remaining 31 patients were used for independent validation. Quantitative PET imaging characteristics including statistical, histogram-related, morphologic, and texture features were analyzed, from which 35 nonredundant and robust features were further evaluated. Cox proportional hazards regression model coupled with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was used to predict distant metastasis. Whether histologic type provided complementary value to imaging by combining both in a single prognostic model was also assessed. Results The optimal prognostic model included two image features that allowed quantification of intratumor heterogeneity and peak standardized uptake value. In the independent validation cohort, this model showed a concordance index of 0.71, which was higher than those of the maximum standardized uptake value and tumor volume, with concordance indexes of 0.67 and 0.64, respectively. The prognostic model also allowed separation of groups with low and high risk for developing distant metastasis (hazard ratio, 4.8; P = .0498, log-rank test), which compared favorably with maximum standardized uptake value and tumor volume (hazard ratio, 1.5 and 2.0, respectively; P = .73 and 0.54, log-rank test, respectively). When combined with histologic types, the prognostic power was further improved (hazard ratio, 6.9; P = .0289, log-rank test; and concordance index, 0.80). Conclusion PET imaging characteristics associated with distant metastasis that could potentially help practitioners to tailor appropriate therapy for individual patients with early-stage NSCLC were identified.

        "Purpose To evaluate the variation among U.S. hospitals in overall use and yield of in-hospital computed tomographic (CT) pulmonary angiography (PA) in patients undergoing total hip replacement (THR) or total knee replacement (TKR) surgery. Materials and Methods Patients in the Premier Research Database who underwent elective TKR or THR between 2007 and 2011 were enrolled in this HIPAA-compliant, institutional review board-approved retrospective observational study. The informed consent requirement was waived. Hospitals were categorized into low, medium, and high tertiles of CT PA use to compare baseline patient- and hospital-level characteristics and pulmonary embolism (PE) positivity rates. To further investigate between-hospital variation in CT PA use, a hierarchical logistic regression model that included hospital-specific random effects and fixed patient- and hospital-level effects was used. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to measure the amount of variability in CT PA use attributable to between-hospital variation. Results The cohort included 205 198 patients discharged from 178 hospitals (median of 734.5 patients discharged per hospital; interquartile range, 316-1461 patients) with 3647 CT PA studies (1.8%). The crude frequency of CT PA scans among the hospitals ranged from 0% to 6.2% (median, 1.6%); more than 90% of the hospitals performed CT PA in less than 3% of their patients. The mean hospital-level PE positivity rate was 12.3% (median, 9.1%); there was no significant difference in PE positivity rate across low through high CT PA use tertiles (11.3%, 11.9%, 12.9%, P = .37). After adjustment for hospital- and patient-level factors, the remaining amount of interhospital variation was relatively low (ICC, 9.0%). Conclusion Limited interhospital variation in use and yield of in-hospital CT PA was observed among patients undergoing TKR or THR in the United States. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "INTRODUCTION: Mammographic density is a strong predictor of breast cancer. The mammographic breast pattern in all age groups is of great significance in the effort to understand the changes in breast pattern in pathological processes, and diseases prevalent in such age groups. It is also very important as the basis for national policy on breast diseases. Menopause has a significant effect on breast pattern and it is documented to have more important influence on the decline in mammographic densities than age. Breast changes in postmenopausal women are also affected by parity, positive family history of breast cancer and race. This study therefore aimed to describe the breast parenchymal pattern in post menopausal women. The study using ACR BIRADS Category has also correlated the socio-demographic and anthropometric characteristics with the described breast pattern.\r\nMETHODOLOGY: This is a retrospective descriptive study carried out in the Radiology Department of the University College Hospital Ibadan. The mammograms of 196 postmenopausal women which were reported by two experienced breast radiologists in the Department were retrieved and reviewed by the author. The BI-RADS breast parenchymal pattern was classified by the author into two groups, 1and2, and 3and4 for analysis to improve the sensitivity of the result from the small sample size. The final BI-RADS categories were also classified into 0, 1 \u2013 2, 3 \u2013 4 and 5 \u2013 6 groups for the samereason. The report of the mammograms were matched with patients\u2019 data and enteredinto R statistical package for analysis. Chi-square statistical test was used to assess the difference in proportion between these groups and the categorical variables. The p- value was set at 0.05.\r\nRESULTS: The mean age of the women was 55.0\u00b16.8 years and the mean age at menopause was 48.4\u00b14.6 years. The combined BI-RADS 1 and 2 breast parenchymal patterns which are associated with low risk of breast cancer, were found in 82.1% of the study population. The mean age of the women at birth of their first child was 26.12 years. The mean difference in age at first birth between BI-RADS 1and2 and BI-RADS 3and4 was statistically significant p=0.035. Other variables show no significant statistical correlation likely due to the small sample size.\r\nCONCLUSION: The higher percentage of BI-RADS 1 and 2 breast pattern in this study which is associated with lower incidence of breast cancer in African women supports previous publications, as the dense breast is an important singular risk factor for breast cancer. The clustering of low mean age at birth of first child, low mean age at menopause and multiparity, may be responsible for the higher percentage of BI-RADS 1 and 2 breast npatterns in majority of the women in this study. Family and personal history of breast cancer and BMI also correlated with breast pattern; however these were not statistically significant, probably due to the small sample size. Further study with a larger sample size will clarify the statistical significance of these associations.",
        "To prospectively optimize multistep algorithms for largest available multitined radiofrequency (RF) electrode system in ex vivo and in vivo tissues, to determine best energy parameters to achieve large predictable target sizes of coagulation, and to compare these algorithms with manufacturer's recommended algorithms.Institutional animal care and use committee approval was obtained for the in vivo portion of this study. Ablation (n = 473) was performed in ex vivo bovine liver; final tine extension was 5-7 cm. Variables in stepped-deployment RF algorithm were interrogated and included initial current ramping to 105 degrees C (1 degrees C/0.5-5.0 sec), the number of sequential tine extensions (2-7 cm), and duration of application (4-12 minutes) for final two to three tine extensions. Optimal parameters to achieve 5-7 cm of coagulation were compared with recommended algorithms. Optimal settings for 5- and 6-cm final tine extensions were confirmed in in vivo perfused bovine liver (n = 14). Multivariate analysis of variance and/or paired t tests were used.Mean RF ablation zones of 5.1 cm +/- 0.2 (standard deviation), 6.3 cm +/- 0.4, and 7 cm +/- 0.3 were achieved with 5-, 6-, and 7-cm final tine extensions in a mean of 19.5 min +/- 0.5, 27.9 min +/- 6, and 37.1 min +/- 2.3, respectively, at optimal settings. With these algorithms, size of ablation at 6- and 7-cm tine extension significantly increased from mean of 5.4 cm +/- 0.4 and 6.1 cm +/- 0.6 (manufacturer's algorithms) (P <.05, both comparisons); two recommended tine extensions were eliminated. In vivo confirmation produced mean diameter in specified time: 5.5 cm +/- 0.4 in 18.5 min +/- 0.5 (5-cm extensions) and 5.7 cm +/- 0.2 in 21.2 min +/- 0.6 (6-cm extensions).Large zones of coagulation of 5-7 cm can be created with optimized RF algorithms that help reduce number of tine extensions compared with manufacturer's recommendations. Such algorithms are likely to facilitate the utility of these devices for RF ablation of focal tumors in clinical practice.",

Materials and Methods Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, and the study protocol was approved by the medical ethics committee. The study followed 12 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (seven men; mean age, 46 years \u00b1 2 [standard error]) before and after 6 months of moderate-intensity exercise, followed by a high-altitude trekking expedition with exercise of long duration. Abdominal, epicardial, and paracardial fat volume were measured by using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Cardiac function was quantified with cardiac MR, and images were analyzed by a researcher who was supervised by a senior researcher (4 and 21 years of respective experience in cardiac MR). Hepatic, myocardial, and intramyocellular triglyceride (TG) content relative to water were measured with proton MR spectroscopy at 1.5 and 7 T. Two-tailed paired t tests were used for statistical analysis. Results Exercise reduced visceral abdominal fat volume from 348 mL \u00b1 57 to 219 mL \u00b1 33 (P < .01), and subcutaneous abdominal fat volume remained unchanged (P = .9). Exercise decreased hepatic TG content from 6.8% \u00b1 2.3 to 4.6% \u00b1 1.6 (P < .01) and paracardial fat volume from 4.6 mL \u00b1 0.9 to 3.7 mL \u00b1 0.8 (P = .02). Exercise did not change epicardial fat volume (P = .9), myocardial TG content (P = .9), intramyocellular lipid content (P = .3), or cardiac function (P = .5). Conclusion A 6-month exercise intervention in type 2 diabetes mellitus decreased hepatic TG content and visceral abdominal and paracardial fat volume, which are associated with increased cardiovascular risk, but cardiac function was unaffected. Tissue-specific exercise-induced changes in body fat distribution in type 2 diabetes mellitus were demonstrated in this study. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "Purpose To investigate whether qualitative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging assessments of background parenchymal enhancement (BPE), amount of fibroglandular tissue (FGT), and mammographic density are associated with risk of developing breast cancer in women who are at high risk. Materials and Methods In this institutional review board\u2013approved HIPAA-compliant retrospective study, all screening breast MR images obtained from January 2006 to December 2011 in women aged 18 years or older and at high risk for but without a history of breast cancer were identified. Women in whom breast cancer was diagnosed after index MR imaging comprised the cancer cohort, and one-to-one matching (age and BRCA status) of each woman with breast cancer to a control subject was performed by using MR images obtained in women who did not develop breast cancer with follow-up time maximized. Amount of BPE, BPE pattern (peripheral vs central), amount of FGT at MR imaging, and mammographic density were assessed on index images. Imaging features were compared between cancer and control cohorts by using conditional logistic regression. Results Twenty-three women at high risk (mean age, 47 years \u00b1 10 [standard deviation]; six women had BRCA mutations) with no history of breast cancer underwent screening breast MR imaging; in these women, a diagnosis of breast cancer (invasive, n = 12; in situ, n = 11) was made during the follow-up interval. Women with mild, moderate, or marked BPE were nine times more likely to receive a diagnosis of breast cancer during the follow-up interval than were those with minimal BPE (P = .007; odds ratio = 9.0; 95% confidence interval: 1.1, 71.0). BPE pattern, MR imaging amount of FGT, and mammographic density were not significantly different between the cohorts (P = .5, P = .5, and P = .4, respectively). Conclusion Greater BPE was associated with a higher probability of developing breast cancer in women at high risk for cancer and warrants further study. \u00a9 RSNA, 2015 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To use inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) to evaluate gadolinium accumulation in brain tissues, including the dentate nucleus (DN) and globus pallidus (GP), in subjects who received a gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA).Institutional review board approval was obtained for this study. Written informed consent for postmortem investigation was obtained either from the subject prior to his or her death or afterward from the subject's relatives. Brain tissues obtained at autopsy in five subjects who received a linear GBCA (GBCA group) and five subjects with no history of GBCA administration (non-GBCA group) were examined with ICP-MS. Formalin-fixed DN tissue, the inner segment of the GP, cerebellar white matter, the frontal lobe cortex, and frontal lobe white matter were obtained, and their gadolinium concentrations were measured. None of the subjects had received a diagnosis of severely compromised renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate <45 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) or acute renal failure. Fisher permutation test was used to compare gadolinium concentrations between the two groups and among brain regions.Gadolinium was detected in all specimens in the GBCA agent group (mean, 0.25 \u00b5g per gram of brain tissue \u00b1 0.44 [standard deviation]), with significantly higher concentrations in each region (P = .004 vs the non-GBCA group for all regions). In the GBCA group, the DN and GP showed significantly higher gadolinium concentrations (mean, 0.44 \u00b5g/g \u00b1 0.63) than other regions (0.12 \u00b5g/g \u00b1 0.16) (P = .029).Even in subjects without severe renal dysfunction, GBCA administration causes gadolinium accumulation in the brain, especially in the DN and GP.",
        "Purpose To determine the energy levels that provide optimal imaging of thoracic circulation at dual-energy computed tomographic (CT) angiography with reduced iodine load in comparison with a standard technique. Materials and Methods The institutional review board approved the study with waiver of patient consent. Eighty patients underwent a dual-source, dual-energy CT examination after administration of low-concentration contrast material (170 mg of iodine per milliliter), and eight series of images were reconstructed, including the original polychromatic images at 80 and 140 kV and six series of virtual monochromatic spectral images at 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 keV. For each vascular compartment, the energy level that provided optimal evaluation on virtual monochromatic spectral images was determined, and these series were compared with the polychromatic dual-energy images and with standard chest CT images that were used as controls. Comparisons between groups were performed by using the paired Student t test for continuous variables and the McNemar test for categorical variables. Comparisons between dual-energy and standard CT images were performed by using the unpaired Student t test for continuous variables and the \u03c72 test for categorical variables. Results For the aorta, pulmonary arteries, and veins, the reconstruction at 60 keV provided adequate attenuation without marked beam-hardening artifacts in 90% of patients, with the highest contrast-to-noise and signal-to-noise ratios, the lowest level of subjective noise, and no significant differences with images at 80 kV (mean energy, 54 keV). For the superior vena cava and brachiocephalic veins, the reconstructions at 100 keV enabled artifact-free analysis of the perivascular anatomic zone without a significant difference with images at 140 kV (mean energy, 92 keV). Compared with standard CT images acquired after administration of a 35% iodinated contrast agent, there was a statistically significant reduction in the frequency of artifacts around systemic veins at 100 keV (P < .001) and similar overall image quality for central vessels at 60 keV (P > .05). Conclusion An optimal analysis of thoracic circulation can be achieved on virtual monochromatic spectral images at 60 keV and 100 keV and on the original polychromatic images at 80 kV and 140 kV. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.12120195/-/DC1",
        "To evaluate the added value of computer-aided detection (CAD) for lung nodules on chest radiographs when radiologists have bone-suppressed images (BSIs) available.Written informed consent was waived by the institutional review board. Selection of study images and study setup was reviewed and approved by the institutional review boards. Three hundred posteroanterior (PA) and lateral chest radiographs (189 radiographs with negative findings and 111 radiographs with a solitary nodule) in 300 subjects were selected from image archives at four institutions. PA images were processed by using a commercially available CAD, and PA BSIs were generated. Five radiologists and three residents evaluated the radiographs with BSIs available, first, without CAD and, second, after inspection of the CAD marks. Readers marked locations suspicious for a nodule and provided a confidence score for that location to be a nodule. Location-based receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed by using jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic analysis. Area under the curve (AUC) functioned as figure of merit, and P values were computed with the Dorfman-Berbaum-Metz method.Average nodule size was 16.2 mm. Stand-alone CAD reached a sensitivity of 74% at 1.0 false-positive mark per image. Without CAD, average AUC for observers was 0.812. With CAD, performance significantly improved to an AUC of 0.841 (P = .0001). CAD detected 127 of 239 nodules that were missed after evaluation of the radiographs together with BSIs pooled over all observers. Only 57 of these detections were eventually marked by the observers after review of CAD candidates.CAD improved radiologists' performance for the detection of lung nodules on chest radiographs, even when baseline performance was optimized by providing lateral radiographs and BSIs. Still, most of the true-positive CAD candidates are dismissed by observers.",
        "Background: The intima media thickness (IMT) has been established as an early predictor of general arteriosclerosis in patients with hypertension. However, to date, there is paucity of information on IMT of common carotid artery in healthy patients and in patients with risk factors for cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, diabetics and obesity in study area. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the carotid\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nintima media thickness in patients with hypertension and normotensive adults attending Jos University Teaching Hospital Jos, Nigeria.Materials and Methods: This prospective study was conducted over a period of four months (November 2012 to February 2013) on 200 hypertensive patients and 100 normotensive adults aged 18 \u2013 70 years. The common carotid artery (CCA) was scanned using an ALOKA SSD-3500 ultrasound scanner with Doppler facility and a 7.5MHz linear transducer. Three measurements of the CIMT were obtained at 1cm proximal to the right and left carotid bulb and the mean value of the three measurements was recorded.\r\nResults: The age range of the 300 patients comprising of 104 males and 196 females was 18 \u2013 70 years with a mean age of 41.44 \u00b112. The overall mean CIMT was 0.89mm\u00b10.13 and 0.61mm\u00b10.10 for hypertensive and normotensive subjects respectively. Mean CIMT was significantly higher in hypertensive compared to normotensive subjects (p=0.000). CIMT correlated positively with age and blood pressure in hypertensives but had a negative correlation with BMI. However in normotensives, CIMT correlated positively with age and BMI. Male hypertensives had higher CIMT when compared to female. In hypertensive subjects, overall right and left mean CIMT was 0.89 + 0.13 and 0.89 + 0.18, while in normotensives the overall right and left mean CIMT value was 0.61 + 0.10 and 0.60 \u00b1 0.10 respectively. There was no significant difference between the two sides. Artherosclerotic plaques were seen in the wall of the right CCA in six (3%) hypertensive patients, while none was seen in the normotensive group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion: This study has shown that there is a significant difference in the CIMT of hypertensive compared to normotensive subject. Higher values of CIMT were seen in hypertensive subject compared to normotensive. Age, sex, BMI and blood pressure levels have significant effect on CIMT of hypertensive patients.",
        "Purpose To retrospectively analyze whether Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 2 is helpful for the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer. Materials and Methods Institutional review board approved this retrospective study. A total of 425 patients with prostate cancer who had undergone magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and radical prostatectomy were included. Preoperative parameters such as prostate-specific antigen, biopsy Gleason score, greatest percentage of the core, percentage of the positive core number, and score at PI-RADS version 2 with MR imaging were investigated. Two independent readers performed PI-RADS scoring. Clinically significant prostate cancer was defined as follows: (a) Gleason score of 7 or greater, (b) tumor volume of 0.5 cm(3) or greater, or a (c) positive extracapsular extension or seminal vesicle invasion. The reference standard was based on review of surgical specimen. Logistic regression was conducted to determine which parameters are associated with the presence of clinically significant cancer. Interreader agreement (ie, score \u22654 or not) was investigated by using \u03ba statistics. Results At univariate analysis, all of the preoperative parameters were significant for clinically significant prostate cancer (P < .05). However, multivariate analysis revealed that PI-RADS score was the only significant parameter for both readers (reader 1: odds ratio = 28.170, P = .002; reader 2: odds ratio = 5.474, P = .007). The interreader agreement was excellent for PI-RADS score of 4 or greater (weighted \u03ba = 0.801; 95% confidence interval: 0.737, 0.865). Conclusion The use of PI-RADS version 2 may help preoperatively diagnose clinically significant prostate cancer. (\u00a9) RSNA, 2016.",
        "To determine whether ureteral segments not filled with contrast material at computed tomographic (CT) urography ever contain tumor detectable only by filling these segments with contrast material.In this institutional review board-approved, HIPAA-compliant retrospective study, with waiver of informed consent, databases were searched for all patients who underwent heminephroureterectomy or ureteroscopy between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2009, with available CT urography findings in the 12 months prior to surgery or biopsy and patients who had undergone at least two CT urography procedures with a minimum 5-year follow-up between studies. One of two radiologists blinded to results of pathologic examination recorded location of unfilled segments, time of scan, subsequent filling, and pathologic or 5-year follow-up CT urography results. Tumors were considered missed in an unfilled segment if tumor was found at pathologic examination or follow-up CT urography in the same one-third of the ureter and there were no secondary signs of a mass with other index CT urography sequences. Estimated radiation dose for additional delayed sequences was calculated with a 32-cm phantom.In 59 male and 33 female patients (mean age, 66 years) undergoing heminephroureterectomy, 27 tumors were present in 41 partially nonopacified ureters in 20 patients. Six tumors were present in nonopacified segments (one multifocal, none bilateral); all were identifiable by means of secondary signs present with earlier sequences. Among 182 lesions biopsied at ureteroscopy in 124 male and 53 female patients (mean age, 69 years), 28 tumors were present in nonopacified segments in 25 patients (four multifocal, none bilateral), all with secondary imaging signs detectable without delayed scanning. In 64 male and 29 female patients (mean age, 69 years) who underwent 5-year follow-up CT urography, three new tumors were revealed in three patients; none occurred in the unfilled ureter at index CT urography. Estimated radiation dose from additional sequences was 4.3 mSv per patient.Targeted delayed scanning at CT urography yielded no additional ureteral tumors and resulted in additional radiation exposure.",
        "To compare screening recall rates and cancer detection rates of tomosynthesis plus conventional digital mammography to those of conventional digital mammography alone.All patients presenting for screening mammography between October 1, 2011, and September 30, 2012, at four clinical sites were reviewed in this HIPAA-compliant retrospective study, for which the institutional review board granted approval and waived the requirement for informed consent. Patients at sites with digital tomosynthesis were offered screening with digital mammography plus tomosynthesis. Patients at sites without tomosynthesis underwent conventional digital mammography. Recall rates were calculated and stratified according to breast density and patient age. Cancer detection rates were calculated and stratified according to the presence of a risk factor for breast cancer. The Fisher exact test was used to compare the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the effect of screening method, breast density, patient age, and cancer risk on the odds of recall from screening.A total of 13 158 patients presented for screening mammography; 6100 received tomosynthesis. The overall recall rate was 8.4% for patients in the tomosynthesis group and 12.0% for those in the conventional mammography group (P < .01). The addition of tomosynthesis reduced recall rates for all breast density and patient age groups, with significant differences (P < .05) found for scattered fibroglandular, heterogeneously dense, and extremely dense breasts and for patients younger than 40 years, those aged 40-49 years, those aged 50-59 years, and those aged 60-69 years. These findings persisted when multivariate logistic regression was used to control for differences in age, breast density, and elevated risk of breast cancer. The cancer detection rate was 5.7 per 1000 in patients receiving tomosynthesis versus 5.2 per 1000 in patients receiving conventional mammography alone (P = .70).Patients undergoing tomosynthesis plus digital mammography had significantly lower screening recall rates. The greatest reductions were for those younger than 50 years and those with dense breasts. A nonsignificant 9.5% increase in cancer detection was observed in the tomosynthesis group.",
        "To evaluate the performance of computed tomographic (CT) examinations at 80 and 100 kV with tube current-time products of 75-150 mA and the effect of adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) on CT image quality in patients with urinary stone disease.In this HIPAA-compliant institutional review board-approved study, verbal consent for prospective low-dose CT and waivers of consent for retrospective review of CT scans were obtained. Between November 2010 and April 2011, 25 patients (15 men, 10 women; mean age, 35 years) with urolithiasis underwent 64-section multidetector CT with 75-150 mA and noise index of 30. Modified protocol was based on body weight (<200 lb [90 kg], 80 kV; >200 lb [90 kg], 100 kV). Images of 5-mm section thickness were reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP) and 60% and 80% ASIR techniques, with 3-mm coronal and sagittal reformations. Two readers independently reviewed FBP and ASIR data sets for image quality (scale, 1-5), noise (scale , 1-3), and calculi (number, size, location). Confidence levels for urolithiaisis and alternate diagnoses were rated (scale, 1-3). In 13 patients, FBP CT images acquired with the reference standard departmental protocol were available for comparison. Radiation dose was compared between imaging series. Statistical analysis was performed with Wilcoxon signed rank and paired t tests.Modified-protocol FBP images showed low image quality (score, 2.5), with improvement on modified-protocol ASIR images (score, 3.4) (P=.03). All 33 stones (mean diameter, 6.1 mm; range, 2-28 mm) at modified-protocol CT were diagnosed by both readers. In 20 of 25 patients (80%), ASIR images were rated adequate for rendering other diagnoses in the abdomen (score, 2.0), as opposed to FBP images (score, 1.3). Mean radiation dose for modified-protocol CT was 1.8 mGy (1.3 mGy for patients<200 lb; 2.3 mGy for patients>200 lb) in comparison with 9.9 mGy for reference-protocol CT (P=.001).Image quality improvements with ASIR at reduced radiation dose of 1.8 mGy enabled effective evaluation of urinary calculi without substantially affecting diagnostic confidence. \u00a9 RSNA, 2012.",
        "Purpose To determine whether hyperpolarized helium 3 magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to measure alveolar partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) shows sufficient test-retest repeatability and between-cohort differences to be used as a reliable technique for detection of alterations in gas exchange in asymptomatic smokers. Materials and Methods The protocol was approved by the local institutional review board and was HIPAA compliant. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Two sets of MR images were obtained 10 minutes apart in 25 subjects: 10 nonsmokers (five men, five women; mean \u00b1 standard deviation age, 50 years \u00b1 6) and 15 smokers (seven women, eight men; mean age, 50 years \u00b1 8). A mixed-effects model was developed to identify the regional repeatability of Pao2 measurements as an intraclass correlation coefficient. Ten smokers were matched with the 10 nonsmokers on the basis of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Three separate models were generated: one for nonsmokers, one for the SNR-matched smokers, and one for the five remaining smokers, who were imaged with a significantly higher SNR. Results Short-term back-to-back regional reproducibility was assessed by using intraclass correlation coefficients, which were 0.67 and 0.65 for SNR case-matched nonsmokers and smokers, respectively. Repeatability was a strong function of SNR; a 50% increase in SNR in the remaining smokers improved the intraclass correlation coefficient to 0.82. Although repeatability was not significantly different between the SNR-matched cohorts (P = .44), the smoker group showed higher spatial and temporal variability in Pao2. Conclusion The short-term test-retest repeatability of hyperpolarized gas MR imaging of regional Pao2 was good. Asymptomatic smokers exhibited greater spatial and temporal variability in Pao2 than did the nonsmokers, which suggests that this parameter allows detection of small functional alterations associated with smoking. \u00a9 RSNA, 2015 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To determine if ultrasonographic (US) renal shear-wave speed (SWS) measurements obtained either before or after intravenous diuretic administration can be used to discriminate obstructive hydronephrosis from unobstructive hydronephrosis in children, with diuretic renal scintigraphy as the reference standard.Institutional review board approval and parental informed consent were obtained for this HIPAA-compliant prospective cross-sectional blind comparison with a reference standard. Between November 2012 and September 2014, 37 children (mean age, 4.1 years; age range, 1 month to 17 years) underwent shear-wave elastography of the kidneys immediately before and immediately after diuretic renal scintigraphy (reference standard for presence of urinary tract obstruction). Median SWS measurements (in meters per second), as well as change in median SWS (median SWS after diuretic administration minus median SWS before diuretic administration) were correlated with the amount of time required for kidney radiotracer activity to fall by 50% after intravenous administration of the diuretic (T1/2). Median SWS measurements were compared with degree of obstruction and degree of hydronephrosis with analysis of variance. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were created.Radiotracer T1/2 values after diuretic administration did not correlate with median SWS measurements obtained before (r = -0.08, P = .53) or after (r = -0.0004, P >.99) diuretic administration, nor did they correlate with intraindividual change in median SWS (r = 0.07, P = .56). There was no significant difference in pre- or postdiuretic median SWS measurements between kidneys with scintigraphic evidence of no, equivocal, or definite urinary tract obstruction (P > .5) or for median SWS measurements between kidneys with increasing degree of hydronephrosis (P > .5). ROC curves showed poor diagnostic performance of median SWS in discerning no, equivocal, or definite urinary tract obstruction (area under the ROC curve ranged from 0.50 to 0.62).US SWS measurements did not enable discrimination of obstructive hydronephrosis from unobstructive hydronephrosis in children.",
        "To determine whether multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging can help identify patients with prostate cancer who would most appropriately be candidates for active surveillance (AS) according to current guidelines and to compare the results with those of conventional clinical assessment scoring systems, including the D'Amico, Epstein, and Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) systems, on the basis of findings at prostatectomy.This institutional review board-approved HIPAA-compliant retrospectively designed study included 133 patients (mean age, 59.3 years) with a mean prostate-specific antigen level of 6.73 ng/mL (median, 4.39 ng/mL) who underwent multiparametric MR imaging at 3.0 T before radical prostatectomy. Informed consent was obtained from all patients. Patients were then retrospectively classified as to whether they would have met AS eligibility criteria or were better served by surgery. AS eligibility criteria for prostatectomy specimens were a dominant tumor smaller than 0.5 mL without Gleason 4 or 5 patterns or extracapsular or seminal vesicle invasion. Conventional clinical assessment scores (the D'Amico, Epstein, and CAPRA scoring systems) were compared with multiparametric MR imaging findings for predicting AS candidates. The level of significance of difference between scoring systems was determined by using the \u03c7(2) test for categoric variables with the level of significance set at P < .05.Among 133 patients, 14 were eligible for AS on the basis of prostatectomy results. The sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), and overall accuracy, respectively, were 93%, 25%, and 70% for the D'Amico system, 64%, 45%, and 88% for the Epstein criteria, and 93%, 20%, and 59% for the CAPRA scoring system for predicting AS candidates (P < .005 for all, \u03c7(2) test), while multiparametric MR imaging had a sensitivity of 93%, a PPV of 57%, and an overall accuracy of 92% (P < .005).Multiparametric MR imaging provides useful additional information to existing clinicopathologic scoring systems of prostate cancer and improves the assignment of treatment (eg, AS or active treatment).",
        "To retrospectively compare the detection and characterization of hepatic perfusion disorder (HPD) associated with focal liver lesions (FLLs) at contrast material-enhanced ultrasonography (US) by using contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) as the reference standard.The study was approved by the local institutional ethics committee, and informed consent was waived. Three hundred fifty patients (mean age, 50 years \u00b1 11 [standard deviation]; age range, 19-82 years; 168 women, 182 men) underwent contrast-enhanced US and contrast-enhanced CT between April 2008 and July 2010. Two independent readers reviewed contrast-enhanced US images for the detection and characterization of HPD. The largest lesion or the lesion best identified at contrast-enhanced US per patient was used for statistical analysis. Contrast-enhanced CT was used as the reference standard. Contrast-enhanced US and CT interreader agreement of diagnoses was assessed by using the weighted \u03ba coefficient, and influences of lesion size, enhancement covering rate, and liver cirrhosis were evaluated by using logistic regression analysis and the paired \u03c7(2) test. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy of contrast-enhanced US for HPD detection were calculated.Contrast-enhanced US results showed HPD features similar to those of CT imaging. CT depicted 50 HPDs in 350 patients, and contrast-enhanced US depicted 55 HPDs in 350 patients. The agreement for HPD diagnosis between US and CT was good (\u03ba = 0.749). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of contrast-enhanced US were 84.0%, 95.7%, 76.4%, 97.3%, and 0.945, respectively. Rapid enhancement coverage (P < .001) and lesion size (P = .002) were significant predictors of the occurrence of HPD. Liver cirrhosis did not have significant influence for HPD detection (P = .087). Image zooming, limited acoustic window, lesion diameter greater than 5 cm, attenuation, and blurred images were the main reasons for the false-positive diagnosis of HPD at contrast-enhanced US.The HPD in FLLs can reliably be detected with contrast-enhanced US, which correlated well with contrast-enhanced CT images.",

        "Purpose To evaluate the predictive value of imaging and clinical and physiological measurements of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) in patients monitored for more than 5 years for pulmonary exacerbations that required hospitalization. Materials and Methods Exacerbations requiring hospitalization were monitored over 5 years in 91 subjects who provided written informed consent. Study was local research ethics board and Health Canada approved and HIPAA compliant. Subjects with COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease underwent spirometry, plethysmography, diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide, St George's Respiratory Questionnaire, 6-minute walk test, and imaging. Computed tomographic (CT) wall area and relative area with attenuation values less than \u2212950 HU ( RA950relative area with attenuation values less than \u2212950 HU ), helium 3 (3He) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging ventilation defect percentage ( VDP ventilation defect percentage ), and apparent diffusion coefficient were generated. Zero-inflated Poisson model was used to compare number of hospitalizations with lung function and imaging measurements. Results Twenty-four subjects were hospitalized 58 times and had significantly worse forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV1forced expiratory volume in 1 second ) (P < .0001), CT RA950relative area with attenuation values less than \u2212950 HU (P = .02), and 3He VDP ventilation defect percentage (P < .0001) than values in 67 subjects who were not hospitalized. In mild to moderate COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , nine hospitalized subjects had significantly worse FEV1forced expiratory volume in 1 second (P = .02) and 3He VDP ventilation defect percentage (P = .02) than values in 52 subjects who were not hospitalized. 3He VDP ventilation defect percentage was quantitatively related to CT airway morphology (r = 0.26, P = .01) and quantitatively (r = 0.61, P < .0001) and spatially related to emphysema; this spatial relationship was significantly greater for hospitalized patients with COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease than unhospitalized patients (P = .0006). For all subjects, number of prior hospitalizations (P < .0001), 6-minute walk test distance (P < .0001), CT RA950relative area with attenuation values less than \u2212950 HU (P = .03), and 3He VDP ventilation defect percentage (P = .002) were significantly related to number of hospitalizations. For 61 subjects with mild to moderate COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , only 3He VDP ventilation defect percentage was significantly associated with COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations (P = .01). Conclusion 3He MR imaging VDP ventilation defect percentage represents a mixed airways\u2013emphysema phenotype and helps identify subjects with mild to moderate COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who are at risk for exacerbation that requires hospitalization. \u00a9 RSNA, 2014",
        "Purpose To compare the recently proposed Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) scale that incorporates fixed criteria and a standard Likert scale based on overall impression in prostate cancer localization using multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Materials and Methods This retrospective study was HIPAA compliant and institutional review board approved. Seventy patients who underwent 3-T pelvic MR imaging, including T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and dynamic contrast material\u2013enhanced imaging, with a pelvic phased-array coil before radical prostatectomy were included. Three radiologists, each with 6 years of experience, independently scored 18 regions (12 peripheral zone [PZ], six transition zone [TZ]) using PI-RADS (range, scores 3\u201315) and Likert (range, scores 1\u20135) scales. Logistic regression for correlated data was used to compare scales for detection of tumors larger than 3 mm in maximal diameter at prostatectomy. Results Maximal accuracy was achieved with score thresholds of 8 and higher and of 3 and higher for PI-RADS and Likert scales, respectively. At these thresholds, in the PZ, similar accuracy was achieved with the PI-RADS scale and the Likert scale for radiologist 1 (89.0% vs 88.2%, P = .223) and radiologist 3 (88.5% vs 88.2%, P = .739) and greater accuracy was achieved with the PI-RADS scale than the Likert scale for radiologist 2 (89.6% vs 87.1%, P = .008). In the TZ, accuracy was lower with the PI-RADS scale than with the Likert scale for radiologist 1 (70.0% vs 87.1%, P < .001), radiologist 2 (87.6% vs 92.6%, P = .002), and radiologist 3 (82.9% vs 91.2%, P < .001). For tumors with Gleason score of at least 7, sensitivity was higher with the PI-RADS scale than with the Likert scale for radiologist 1 (88.6% vs 82.6%, P = .032), and sensitivity was similar for radiologist 2 (78.0% vs 76.5, P = .467) and radiologist 3 (77.3% vs 81.1%, P = .125). Conclusion Radiologists performed well with both PI-RADS and Likert scales for tumor localization, although, in the TZ, performance was better with the Likert scale than the PI-RADS scale. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Supplemental material: S1",

        "To assess feasibility and reliability of electrocardiographic (ECG)-gated cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with a simplified reusable electrode design that does not touch the skin.In this institutional review board-approved, HIPAA-compliant study, a silicon positioner held four ECG leads and detected ECG signals without requiring shaving, adhesive, or removal of the gown. The patient lies down on the device and the patient's weight ensures good lead contact against patient's gown; electrode gel that soaks through the gown provides electrical contact with the skin. It was tested at 1.5 T on 12 volunteers and 52 patients by using double inversion recovery, steady-state, fast gradient-echo time course perfusion, and delayed inversion recovery sequences. Paired Student t test was used to assess the significance of differences in durations to apply and remove ECG pad and standard leads. Image quality was assessed and rated on a four-point scale by two readers. The ECG signal quality obtained from pad and leads was rated on a five-point scale. Ventricular septal sharpness and signal-to-noise ratio were measured on images generated by ECG gating from pads and standard leads.Application and removal duration was 444 seconds with standard leads compared with 296 seconds with the ECG pad, and mean difference in setup time was 148 seconds (P = .005). Ventricular septal sharpness (1/slope) was 165 for ECG pad and 152 for standard leads (P = .3). Septal signal-to-noise ratio on images generated by cardiac gating with ECG pad was 38 \u00b1 12 (standard deviation) compared with 39 \u00b1 14 for standard leads (P = .7). The qualitative image quality score for ECG pad (3.9 \u00b1 0.19) was comparable to ECG leads (3.8 \u00b1 0.45; P = .47). The mean ECG signal qualitative scores were also comparable (pad vs leads, 4.9 \u00b1 0.43 vs 4.9 \u00b1 0.14, respectively; P = .9). Volunteers preferred the ECG pad and reported that it was comfortable and convenient. ECG pad was successful in 50 of 52 (96%) patients. Two patients, including one with large pleural effusions and another with ventricular tachycardia, were not successfully gated.This simplified approach to ECG gating is faster to set up and more convenient and comfortable for patients.",
        "Substantial societal investments in biomedical research are contributing to an explosion in knowledge that the health delivery system is struggling to effectively implement. Managing this complexity requires ingenuity, research and development, and dedicated resources. Many innovative solutions can be found in quality improvement (QI) activities, defined as the \u201csystematic, data-guided activities designed to bring about immediate, positive changes in the delivery of healthcare in particular settings.\u201d QI shares many similarities with biomedical research, but also differs in several important ways. Inclusion of QI in the peer-reviewed literature is needed to foster its advancement through the dissemination, testing, and refinement of theories, methods, and applications. QI methods and reporting standards are less mature in health care than those of biomedical research. A lack of widespread understanding and consensus regarding the purpose of publishing QI-related material also exists.

        "Purpose To develop a radiomics signature to estimate disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with early-stage (stage I-II) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and assess its incremental value to the traditional staging system and clinical-pathologic risk factors for individual DFS estimation. Materials and Methods Ethical approval by the institutional review board was obtained for this retrospective analysis, and the need to obtain informed consent was waived. This study consisted of 282 consecutive patients with stage IA-IIB NSCLC. A radiomics signature was generated by using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, or LASSO, Cox regression model. Association between the radiomics signature and DFS was explored. Further validation of the radiomics signature as an independent biomarker was performed by using multivariate Cox regression. A radiomics nomogram with the radiomics signature incorporated was constructed to demonstrate the incremental value of the radiomics signature to the traditional staging system and other clinical-pathologic risk factors for individualized DFS estimation, which was then assessed with respect to calibration, discrimination, reclassification, and clinical usefulness. Results The radiomics signature was significantly associated with DFS, independent of clinical-pathologic risk factors. Incorporating the radiomics signature into the radiomics-based nomogram resulted in better performance (P < .0001) for the estimation of DFS (C-index: 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71, 0.73) than with the clinical-pathologic nomogram (C-index: 0.691; 95% CI: 0.68, 0.70), as well as a better calibration and improved accuracy of the classification of survival outcomes (net reclassification improvement: 0.182; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.31; P = .02). Decision curve analysis demonstrated that in terms of clinical usefulness, the radiomics nomogram outperformed the traditional staging system and the clinical-pathologic nomogram. Conclusion The radiomics signature is an independent biomarker for the estimation of DFS in patients with early-stage NSCLC. Combination of the radiomics signature, traditional staging system, and other clinical-pathologic risk factors performed better for individualized DFS estimation in patients with early-stage NSCLC, which might enable a step forward precise medicine. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To assess the safety and efficacy of ultrasonography (US)-guided suprapubic transvaginal (ST) radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the treatment of symptomatic uterine leiomyomas at 1-year follow-up. Materials and Methods The institutional review board approved this prospective study, and all patients provided informed consent. ST RFA was performed as an outpatient procedure 3 days after menstruation in 51 women (age range, 32-52 years; mean age, 42.2 years) with 62 leiomyomas. The leiomyomas were assessed with conventional and contrast material-enhanced US before and after ST RFA for leiomyoma size, location, and blood flow. All patients were evaluated for postoperative complications, including abdominal pain, injury to surrounding tissues and organs, vaginal bleeding, increased vaginal discharge, fever, dyspnea, and menorrhagia, after ST RFA and at follow-up visits. The leiomyoma volumes, improvement in leiomyoma-related symptoms, effect on quality of life (QOL), and patient satisfaction were assessed and compared before and after ST RFA and at follow-up visits by using statistical analyses. Results Sixty-two leiomyomas were successfully treated with ST RFA until 90% of the leiomyoma was echogenic. At 1-month follow-up, 46 (74%) leiomyomas had no contrast enhancement, five (8%) had peripheral enhancement, eight (13%) had focal enhancement, and three (5%) had scattered enhancement at contrast-enhanced US. At 6-month follow-up, the number of leiomyomas that had no enhancement, peripheral enhancement, focal enhancement, or scattered enhancement was 43 (69%), seven (11%), nine (15%), and three (5%), respectively. The leiomyoma volumes were significantly (P < .05) reduced at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up (from 33.0 cm(3) \u00b1 25.1 [standard deviation] before treatment to 6.8 cm(3) \u00b1 7.7 at 12-month follow-up). The mean percentage volume reduction at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up was 28%, 57%, 63%, and 78%, respectively. The scores for symptoms and QOL were all significantly improved (P < .05) at follow-up, going from 45 \u00b1 14 and 65 \u00b1 41, respectively, before treatment to 0 and 100, respectively, at 12-month follow-up. No complications were reported during the periprocedural period or throughout follow-up. Most patients (41 of 45) were satisfied. Conclusion ST RFA may be an effective and safe alternative in the treatment of uterine leiomyomas. (\u00a9) RSNA, 2015 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",

She had a longstanding history of arthritis since early adulthood that predominantly affected her weight-bearing joints. The small joints of her hands and feet were spared. Physical examination findings were notable for the presence of slate gray pigmented areas on the patient\u2019s sclerae, ears, and hands. A urinary catheter sample was noted to turn dark on standing, and the patient reported a lifelong history of darkly discolored urine and dark brown staining of clothing at the axillae. Routine laboratory findings\u2014including full blood count, bone profile, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, urea level, electrolyte levels, and ferritin level\u2014were all within the normal range.

        "To compare the new \"warp\" sequence (slice-encoding metal artifact correction [SEMAC], view-angle tilting [VAT], and increased bandwidth) for the reduction of both through-plane and in-plane magnetic resonance (MR) artifacts with current optimized MR sequences in patients with total hip arthroplasty (THA).The institutional review board issued a waiver for this study. Forty patients with THA were prospectively included. SEMAC, VAT, and increased bandwidth were applied by using the warp turbo-spin-echo sequence at 1.5 T. Coronal short tau inversion-recovery (STIR)-warp and transverse T1-weighted warp (hereafter, T1-warp) images, as well as standard coronal STIR and transverse T1-weighted sequence images optimized with high bandwidth (STIR-hiBW and T1-hiBW), were acquired. Fifteen additional patients were examined to compare the T1-warp and T1-hiBW sequence with an identical matrix size. Signal void was quantified. Qualitative criteria (distinction of anatomic structures, blurring, and noise) were assessed on a five-point scale (1, no artifacts; 5, not visible due to severe artifacts) by two readers. Abnormal imaging findings were recorded. Quantitative data were analyzed with a t test and qualitative data with a Wilcoxon signed rank test.Signal void around the acetabular component was smaller for STIR-warp than STIR-hiBW images (21.6 cm2 vs 42.4 cm2; P=.0001), and for T1-warp than T1-hiBW images (17.6 cm2 vs 20.2 cm2; P=.0001). Anatomic distinction was better on STIR-warp compared with STIR-hiBW images (1.9-2.8 vs 3.6-4.6; P=.0001), and on T1-warp compared with T1-hiBW images (1.3-2.8 vs 1.8-3.2; P<.002). Distortion, blurring, and noise were lower with warp sequences than with the standard sequences (P=.0001). Almost half of the abnormal imaging findings were missed on STIR-hiBW compared with STIR-warp images (55 vs 105 findings; P=.0001), while T1-hiBW was similar to T1-warp imaging (50 vs 55 findings; P=.06).STIR-warp and T1-warp sequences were significantly better according to quantitative and qualitative image criteria, but a clinically relevant artifact reduction was only present for STIR images.",
        "Purpose To test the impact of existing Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 2 (V2) decision rules, as well as of proposed adjustments to these decision rules, on detection of Gleason score (GS) 7 or greater (GS \u22657) prostate cancer. Materials and Methods Two radiologists independently provided PI-RADS V2 scores for the dominant lesion on 343 prostate magnetic resonance (MR) examinations. Diagnostic performance for GS \u22657 tumor was assessed by using MR imaging-ultrasonography fusion-targeted biopsy as the reference. The impact of existing PI-RADS V2 decision rules, as well as a series of exploratory proposed adjustments, on the frequency of GS \u22657 tumor detection, was evaluated. Results A total of 210 lesions were benign, 43 were GS 6, and 90 were GS \u22657. Lesions were GS \u22657 in 0%-4.1% of PI-RADS categories 1 and 2, 11.4%-27.1% of PI-RADS category 3, 44.4%-49.3% of PI-RADS category 4, and 72.1%-73.7% of PI-RADS category 5 lesions. PI-RADS category 4 or greater had sensitivity of 78.9%-87.8% and specificity of 75.5%-79.1 for detecting GS \u22657 tumor. The frequency of GS \u22657 tumor for existing PI-RADS V2 decision rules was 30.0%-33.3% in peripheral zone (PZ) lesions upgraded from category 3 to 4 based on dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) score of positive; 50.0%-66.7% in transition zone (TZ) lesions upgraded from category 3 to 4 based on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) score of 5; and 71.7%-72.7% of lesions in both zones upgraded from category 4 to 5 based on size of 15 mm or greater. The frequency of GS \u22657 tumor for proposed adjustments to the decision rules was 30.0%-60.0% for TZ lesions upgraded from category 3 to 4 based on DWI score of 4; 33.3%-57.1% for TZ lesions upgraded from category 3 to 4 based on DCE score of positive when incorporating new criteria (unencapsulated sheetlike enhancement) for DCE score of positive in TZ; and 56.4%-61.9% for lesions in both zones upgraded from category 4 to 5 based on size of 10-14 mm. Other proposed adjustments yielded GS \u22657 tumor in less than 15% of cases for one or more readers. Conclusion Existing PI-RADS V2 decision rules exhibited reasonable performance in detecting GS \u22657 tumor. Several proposed adjustments to the criteria (in TZ, upgrading category 3 to 4 based on DWI score of 4 or modified DCE score of positive; in PZ or TZ, upgrading category 4 to 5 based on size of 10-14 mm) may also have value for this purpose. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To assess the short-term efficacy and safety of ultrasonographically (US)-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation for treatment of benign solid thyroid nodules.This prospective study was approved by the institutional ethics committee, and written informed consent was acquired. HIFU ablation was performed in one session with US guidance and conscious sedation in 20 euthyroid patients (mean age, 44.5 years) with a benign solitary or dominant thyroid nodule. Thyroid nodule volume, US structure, and Doppler pattern were assessed at baseline, at 1 week, and at 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment. Adverse events associated with HIFU were evaluated. Statistical analysis was conducted by using repeated measures analysis of variance, the Student t test, \u03c7(2) test, and correlation analysis.The mean \u00b1 standard deviation nodule volume was 4.96 mL \u00b1 2.79 at the start of the study. Nodule volume had decreased to 3.05 mL \u00b1 1.96 at the 3-month follow-up examination (n = 20, P < .001), and reached 2.91 mL \u00b1 2.43 by the 6-month follow-up examination (n = 16, P < .001). By then, the mean volume reduction was 48.7% \u00b1 24.3 (P < .001). Isoechoic nodules showed greater reduction at 1 month than did hypoechoic nodules (31.6% \u00b1 18.1 vs 16.4% \u00b1 8.6, P = .053). Nodules with markedly increased blood flow showed smaller volume reduction at 3 months than did less-vascularized nodules (10.9% \u00b1 14.5 vs 41.5% \u00b1 20.3, P = .054). Minor transient complications (eg, subcutaneous edema, mild skin redness) were observed in two patients.Early data suggest that US-guided HIFU ablation is an effective and safe procedure for treatment of benign solid thyroid nodules.

        "To determine the long-term (10-year) survival of patients with colorectal liver metastases treated with radiofrequency (RF) ablation and systemic chemotherapy with intention to treat.Institutional review board approval was obtained for this study. From 1997 to 2006, 99 consecutive patients with 202 small (0.8-4.0 cm; mean: 2.2 cm \u00b1 1.1) metachronous colorectal liver metastases underwent ultrasonography-guided percutaneous RF ablation with internally-cooled electrodes in association with systemic chemotherapy. Patients ineligible for surgery (n = 80) or whose lesions were potentially resectable and who refused surgery (n = 19) were included. Patients were followed up with contrast agent-enhanced computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging for a minimum of 3 years to more than 10 years after RF ablation (n = 99, 67, 49, and 25 for 3, 5, 7, and 10 or more years, respectively). Overall local response rates and long-term survival rates were assessed. For each of these primary endpoints, Kaplan-Meier curves were generated and log-rank tests were used to assess for statistically significant differences.Primary and secondary technical success rates were 93.1% (188 of 202) and 100% (14 of 14), respectively. Local tumor progression occurred in 11.9% (24 of 202) metastases, and 54.2% (13 of 24) of these were re-treated. Patient survival rates increased with re-treatment versus no re-treatment (P < .001). At follow-up, 125 new liver metastases were found, and of these 32.8% (41 of 125) were treated with RF ablation. Overall survival rates were 98.0%, 69.3%, 47.8%, 25.0%, and 18.0% (median: 53.2 months) at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 years, respectively. The major complication rate was 1.3% (two of 156), and there were no procedure-related deaths. At the time this article was written, 32.3% (32 of 99) of the patients were alive, and 67.7% (67 of 99) were deceased, with a median follow-up of 72 months.Adding RF ablation to systemic chemotherapy achieved local control in a large majority of metachronous colorectal liver metastases. The 3- to 10-year survival rates of this relatively large series of patients were essentially equivalent to those of most surgical series reported in the literature.",
        "Purpose To determine the utility of cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) T1 mapping for quantification of diffuse myocardial fibrosis compared with the standard of endomyocardial biopsy. Materials and Methods This HIPAA-compliant study was approved by the institutional review board. Cardiomyopathy patients were retrospectively identified who had undergone endomyocardial biopsy and cardiac MR at one institution during a 5-year period. Forty-seven patients (53% male; mean age, 46.8 years) had undergone diagnostic cardiac MR and endomyocardial biopsy. Thirteen healthy volunteers (54% male; mean age, 38.1 years) underwent cardiac MR as a reference. Myocardial T1 mapping was performed 10.7 minutes \u00b1 2.7 (standard deviation) after bolus injection of 0.2 mmol/kg gadolinium chelate by using an inversion-recovery Look-Locker sequence on a 1.5-T MR imager. Late gadolinium enhancement was assessed by using gradient-echo inversion-recovery sequences. Cardiac MR results were the consensus of two radiologists who were blinded to histopathologic findings. Endomyocardial biopsy fibrosis was quantitatively measured by using automated image analysis software with digital images of specimens stained with Masson trichrome. Histopathologic findings were reported by two pathologists blinded to cardiac MR findings. Statistical analyses included Mann-Whitney U test, analysis of variance, and linear regression. Results Median myocardial fibrosis was 8.5% (interquartile range, 5.7\u201314.4). T1 times were greater in control subjects than in patients without and in patients with evident late gadolinium enhancement (466 msec \u00b1 14, 406 msec \u00b1 59, and 303 msec \u00b1 53, respectively; P < .001). T1 time and histologic fibrosis were inversely correlated (r = \u22120.57; 95% confidence interval: \u22120.74, \u22120.34; P < .0001). The area under the curve for myocardial T1 time to detect fibrosis of greater than 5% was 0.84 at a cutoff of 383 msec. Conclusion Cardiac MR with T1 mapping can provide noninvasive evidence of diffuse myocardial fibrosis in patients referred for evaluation of cardiomyopathy. \u00a9 RSNA, 2012",
        "Purpose To determine computed tomographic (CT) features of primary graft nonfunction (PNF) after liver transplantation in comparison with those of early graft failure or death by identifiable causes. Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval was obtained and informed consent was waived. Among 3947 adult liver transplantations performed in one institution between May 2002 and May 2015, 72 patients died or had graft failure within 10 days, and 38 of them were evaluated with CT. PNF was diagnosed in 21 patients. The other 17 patients who died or had early graft failure were considered the non-PNF control group. On unenhanced CT images, graft attenuation was compared qualitatively. Graft attenuation was measured quantitatively and, if available, the difference between preoperative and postoperative CT (interval change) attenuation was evaluated. Unenhanced CT was evaluated for relative parenchymal enhancement. Statistical analyses included the Fisher exact and \u03c72 tests with Yates correction and the Student t test. Results On unenhanced CT images, grafts with PNF more commonly showed low (eight of 26 [31%]) or extremely low (18 of 26 [69%]) qualitative attenuation compared with grafts in the non-PNF group (three of 21 [14%], one of 21 [5%]; P < .001). The mean attenuation value (30.5 HU \u00b1 10.8) was significantly lower and the mean interval change (24.7 HU \u00b1 12.5) was significantly higher in the PNF group than in the non-PNF group (49.7 HU \u00b1 8.0 and 9.7 HU \u00b1 10.1, respectively; P < .001 and P = .001). There was no significant difference in the proportion of grafts that showed poor enhancement on postcontrast CT images between the PNF group and the non-PNF group (nine of 24 [38%] vs two of 20 [10%], respectively; P = .08). Conclusion Recipients with PNF after liver transplantation tended to show low or extremely low attenuation on unenhanced CT images, and this finding was seen more frequently in patients with PNF than in those who died of identifiable causes and in those with early graft failure. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To determine if a molecular imaging approach targeting the highly oxidative enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) can help noninvasively identify and confirm sites of vascular wall inflammation in a murine model of vasculitis. Materials and Methods Animal experiments were approved by the institutional animal care committee. Twenty-six mice were studied, including eight MPO-deficient and six sham-operated mice as controls. Vasculitis was induced with intraperitoneal injection of Candida albicans water-soluble fraction (CAWS). Aortic root magnetic resonance imaging was performed after intravenous injection of the activatable MPO sensor (bis-5-hydroxytryptamide-diethylenetriaminepentatacetate gadolinium) (n = 23), referred to as MPO-Gd, or gadopentetate dimeglumine (n = 10). Seven mice were randomly assigned to receive either MPO-Gd or gadopentetate dimeglumine first. Aortic root specimens were collected for biochemical and histopathologic analyses to validate imaging findings. Statistical significance was calculated for contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) by using the paired t test. Results In the aortic root, the mean MPO-Gd CNRs after agent injection (CNR = 28.1) were more than 2.5-fold higher than those of sham-operated mice imaged with MPO-Gd and vasculitis mice imaged with gadopentetate dimeglumine (CNR = 10.6) (P < .05). MPO-Gd MR imaging helped identify areas of vasculitis that were not seen at unenhanced and contrast material\u2013enhanced imaging with gadopentetate dimeglumine. Histopathologic and biochemical analyses for MPO and myeloid cells confirmed imaging findings. In MPO-deficient mice, injection of CAWS did not result in a vasculitis phenotype, implying a key role of the imaging target in disease cause. Conclusion Molecular imaging targeting MPO can be a useful biomarker to noninvasively detect and confirm inflammation in vasculitis by using a murine model of Kawasaki disease. \u00a9 RSNA, 2011 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.11110040/-/DC1",
        "To determine whether fluoroscopic balloon dilation (FBD) is a safe and effective method of treating esophageal anastomotic stricture after surgical repair in an unselected patient population.With ethics committee approval, records for 103 consecutive patients who underwent FBD with our interventional radiology service (1999-2011) were reviewed retrospectively. Patients underwent diagnostic contrast material-enhanced study prior to the first dilation. Dilations were performed by using general anesthesia. Outcomes were number and/or frequency of dilations, clinical effectiveness and response to dilations, esophageal perforation, requirement for surgery, and mortality. Data were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (with range). Comparisons were conducted by using the Fisher exact test and log-rank test. The significance level was set at P < .05.One hundred three patients (61 male patients, 59%) underwent 378 FBD sessions (median, two dilations per patient; range, 1-40 dilations). The median age at first FBD was 2.2 years (range, 0.1-19.5 years). The balloon catheter diameters ranged from 4 to 20 mm. FBD was successful in 93 patients (90%): 44 (47%) after single dilation and 49 (53%) after multiple dilations. There was no difference in the proportion of patients who required one dilation and were younger than 1 year versus those who were 1 year of age and older (P > .99; odds ratio, 1.07 [range, 0.43-2.66]). Ten patients (10%) required further procedures: Three underwent stent placement, three underwent esophageal stricture resection, and four underwent esophageal reconstruction. Four esophageal perforations (1%) developed after FBD. Antireflux surgery was performed in 18 patients (17%). There were no deaths.FBD for anastomotic strictures after esophageal atresia repair is feasible and acceptably safe and provides relief of symptoms in most patients (90%); however, about half require more than one dilation, and surgery is best predicted if more than 10 dilations are required.",
        "To examine the associations between intracranial artery calcifications (IACs) and coronary artery calcifications (CACs) in patients with ischemic stroke and to assess the predictive value of IAC for asymptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD).This retrospective study, approved by an institutional review board that waived the need for informed consent, included 314 consecutive patients who had acute ischemic stroke and who underwent both brain and coronary computed tomography (CT) within 1 month of stroke. IAC was quantified semiautomatically by calculating both Agatston scores (area of calcification multiplied by a weighted value assigned to its highest Hounsfield unit) and volumes on thin-section unenhanced images and was correlated with coronary calcium scores and volumes. Quartiles were created for IAC scores and were used for logistic regression analysis. An optimal IAC score cutoff value was determined and used to predict the presence of asymptomatic CAD. Independent factors for asymptomatic CAD were assessed by using multiple logistic regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to evaluate the added value of IAC scores for prediction of asymptomatic CAD.IAC and CAC were significantly correlated for both Agatston scores and volumes (R = 0.665 and 0.663, respectively; P < .001). A graded association was found between IAC scores and presence of asymptomatic CAD. Both IAC scores of 120.11 or greater (odds ratio [OR], 2.57; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.45, 4.55) and diabetes mellitus (OR, 4.23; 95% CI: 2.42, 7.4) were independent predictors for asymptomatic CAD. Adding the IAC score to analytic models significantly improved the ability to predict asymptomatic CAD.The IAC scores quantified by using unenhanced CT correlate significantly with coronary calcium scores and may serve as an independent predictor of asymptomatic CAD in patients with ischemic stroke.",
        "INTRODUCTION: Atherosclerosis implicated in the pathophysiology of stroke is widely assessed by ultrasound evaluation of intima media thickness, plaques and stenosis in the carotid vessels.AIM AND OBJECTIVES: The main aim of this study is to determine the intima media thickness (IMT) in the common carotid arteries, carotid bulb and internal carotid arteries10(CCA, CB and ICA respectively) in stroke patients. The relationship between carotid intima-media thickness with stroke types/ subtypes, and cardiovascular risk factors, sonographic characteristics of carotid plaques with stroke types/ subtypes, and presence of ICA stenosis in stroke is also to be determined.MATERIALS AND METHOD: Using a high frequency linear probe with frequency range between 7.5MHZ to 12 MHZ, 100 adult subjects (50 stroke patients and 50 healthy controls) had their common carotid arteries, carotid bulb and internal carotid arteries on both sides evaluated for their intima- media thickness and presence of plaques on B mode and velocities on colour Doppler interrogation. In addition, detailed clinical histories were taken and laboratory examinations done to measure traditional risk factors in the study subjects. Data was analysed using SPSS version 18.RESULTS: IMT was higher in stroke patients compared to controls in the 3 carotid segments (all p < 0.05). The mean IMT (average of both sides) were 1.36 0.29mm, 1.37 0.51mm and 1.20 0.26mm in the stroke cases and 0.72 0.09mm, 0.70 0.09mm and 0.69 0.09mm in the healthy controls in the CCA, CB and ICA respectfully. IMT was also higher with the presence of plaques in both cases and controls, and in ischemic stroke compared to the haemorrhagic stroke particularly in the non-lacunar and lacunar subtypes. IMT among the stroke cases did not differ in the presence of risk factors except for age. IMT in the 3 carotid segments significantly increased with increasing age in both cases and controls on both sides (all p < 0.05). Stroke cases also had significantly more plaques than the controls except in the contralateral bulb and both ICA. Plaques with irregular surfaces and ulcerations were associated with non-lacunar stroke in theipsilateral CCA and hypoechoic plaques with non-lacunar stroke in the ipsilateral bulb. ICA stenosis occurred in 4 (8%) of the stroke cases in this study.CONCLUSION: IMT is increased with increasing age and in stroke subjects compared to healthy controls. Carotid IMTs, number and sonographic characteristics of plaques with velocity measurements are helpful in typing and subtyping of stroke. ICA stenosis occurred in only 8% of the stroke cases in this study.",
        "Purpose To compare the diagnostic performance of the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging\u2013based Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) and a Likert scale in the detection of prostate cancer in a cohort of patients undergoing initial prostate biopsy. Materials and Methods This institutional review board\u2013approved two-center prospective study included 118 patients with normal digital rectal examination (DRE) results but elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels (4\u201320 ng/mL) who were referred for initial prostate biopsies and had one suspicious (Likert scale score, \u22653) focus at prebiopsy 1.5-T multiparametric MR imaging performed with T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted [DW], and dynamic contrast material\u2013enhanced imaging. Targeted core biopsies and random systematic core biopsies were performed. The elementary unit for analysis was the core. Relationships were assessed by using the Mann-Whitney U test. Yates corrected and Pearson \u03c72 tests were used to evaluate categoric variables. A training set was randomly drawn to construct the receiver operating characteristic curves for the summed PI-RADS scores and for the Likert scale scores. The thresholds to recommend biopsy were obtained from the Youden J statistics and were tested in the remaining validation set in terms of predictive characteristics. Interobserver variability was analyzed by using weighed \u03ba statistics in a random set of 50 patients. Results Higher T2-weighted, DW, and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging PI-RADS scores were observed in areas that yielded cancer-positive cores. The percentage of positive cores increased with the sum of scores aggregated in five classes as follows: For summed PI-RADS scores of 3\u20135, the percentage of positive cores was 2.3%; for scores of 6\u20138, it was 5.8%; for scores of 9 or 10, it was 24.7%; for scores of 11 or 12, it was 51.8%; and for scores of 13\u201315, it was 72.1% (P for trend, <.0001). For the threshold of summed PI-RADS scores of 9 or greater, sensitivity was 86.6%, specificity was 82.4%, the positive predictive value was 52.4%, the negative predictive value was 96.5%, and accuracy was 83.2%. The respective data for Likert scale scores of 3 or greater were 93.8%, 73.6%, 44.3%, 98.1%, and 73.3%. Good interobserver agreement was observed for the Likert scale (\u03ba = 0.80) and the summed PI-RADS (\u03ba = 0.73) scoring systems. Conclusion PI-RADS provided the site-specific stratified risk of cancer-positive cores in biopsy-naive men with normal DRE results and elevated PSA levels. There was no significant difference between summed PI-RADS scores of 9 or greater and Likert scale scores of 3 or greater in the detection of cancer in the peripheral zone. \u00a9 RSNA, 2015",
        "Purpose To evaluate the prognostic value of the restaging system after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in patients with advanced-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Materials and Methods This study was approved by the clinical research committee and a written informed consent was required before enrolling in the study. Prospectively enrolled were 412 consecutive patients with stage III-IVb NPC treated with NACT followed by concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Patients were staged before NACT and restaged after NACT. The progression-free survival (PFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) were calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method, and differences were compared by using the log-rank test. Results Post-NACT T classification (PFS, P = .001) and N classification (PFS, P < .001; DMFS, P = .001) resulted in better survival curve separations than pre-NACT T classification and N classification. Patients downstaged from N2-N3 to N0-N1 disease had a better prognosis than did patients who continued to have N2-N3 diseases (3-year PFS, 83.8% vs 66.6%, P = .001; 3-year DMFS, 88.0% vs 78.4%, P = .026). Multivariate analysis revealed that post-NACT T classification (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.67; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.18, 2.36; P = .003) and post-NACT N classification (HR = 1.54; 95% CI: 1.17, 2.03; P = .002) were independent prognostic factors for PFS; also, post-NACT N classification (HR = 1.48; 95% CI: 1.05, 2.07; P = .025) was an independent prognostic factor for DMFS. Multivariate analysis in patients with N2-N3 disease demonstrated that the N downstaging effects of NACT was the only independent prognostic factor for PFS (HR = 0.48; 95% CI: 0.29, 0.81; P = .006) and DMFS (HR = 0.52; 95% CI: 0.28, 0.97; P = .039). Conclusion The post-NACT stage is more representative of prognosis than the pre-NACT stage in advanced-stage NPC patients, which suggests that major clinical decisions should be based on the post-NACT stage. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To measure the levels of gadolinium present in the rat brain 1 and 20 weeks after dosing with contrast agent and to determine if there are any histopathologic sequelae. Materials and Methods The study was approved by the GE Global Research Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Absolute gadolinium levels were quantified in the blood and brains of rats 1 week after dosing and 20 weeks after dosing with up to 20 repeat doses of gadodiamide (cumulative dose, 12 mmol per kilogram of body weight) by using inductively coupled plasma\u2013mass spectrometry. Treatment groups (n = 6 rats per group) included low-dosage and high-dosage gadodiamide and osmolality-matched saline controls. Brain sections were submitted (blinded) for standard toxicology assessment per Registry of Industrial Toxicology Animal data guidelines. Analysis of variance and Mann-Whitney U tests with post hoc correction were used to assess differences in absolute gadolinium levels and percentage of injected dose, respectively. Results Dose-dependent low levels of gadolinium were detected in the brain, a mean \u00b1 standard deviation of 2.49 nmol per gram of brain tissue \u00b1 0.30 or 0.00019% of the injected dose 1 week after dosing. This diminished by approximately 50% (to 1.38 nmol per gram of brain tissue \u00b1 0.10 or 0.00011% of the injected dose) 20 weeks after dosing. As a percentage of injected dose, the levels of gadolinium measured were comparable between different doses, indicating that mechanisms of uptake and elimination were not saturated at the tested doses. There were no histopathologic findings associated with the levels of gadolinium measured. Conclusion Low levels of gadolinium are present in the brain after repeat dosing with gadodiamide, which is partially cleared over 20 weeks with no detectable neurotoxicity.",
        "Purpose To define the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging prevalence of pancreatic cysts in a cohort of patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) compared with a control group without ADPKD that was matched for age, sex, and renal function. Materials and Methods In this HIPAA-compliant, institutional review board\u2013approved study, all patients with ADPKD provided informed consent; for control subjects, informed consent was waived. Patients with ADPKD (n = 110) with mutations identified in PKD1 or PKD2 and control subjects without ADPKD or known pancreatic disease (n = 110) who were matched for age, sex, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and date of MR imaging examination were evaluated for pancreatic cysts by using axial and coronal single-shot fast spin-echo T2-weighted images obtained at 1.5 T. Total kidney volume and liver volume were measured. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to evaluate potential associations between collected variables and presence of pancreatic cysts among patients with ADPKD. The number, size, location, and imaging characteristics of the cysts were recorded. Results Patients with ADPKD were significantly more likely than control subjects to have at least one pancreatic cyst (40 of 110 patients [36%] vs 25 of 110 control subjects [23%]; P = .027). In a univariate analysis, pancreatic cysts were more prevalent in patients with ADPKD with mutations in PKD2 than in PKD1 (21 of 34 patients [62%] vs 19 of 76 patients [25%]; P = .0002). In a multivariable logistic regression model, PKD2 mutation locus was significantly associated with the presence of pancreatic cysts (P = .0004) and with liver volume (P = .038). Patients with ADPKD and a pancreatic cyst were 5.9 times more likely to have a PKD2 mutation than a PKD1 mutation after adjusting for age, race, sex, estimated glomerular filtration rate, liver volume, and total kidney volume. Conclusion Pancreatic cysts were more prevalent in patients with ADPKD with PKD2 mutation than in control subjects or patients with PKD1 mutation. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To compare the accuracy of several magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-based methods for hepatic proton-density fat fraction (FF) estimation at 3.0 T, with spectroscopy as the reference technique.This prospective study was institutional review board approved and HIPAA compliant. Informed consent was obtained. One hundred sixty-three subjects (39 with known hepatic steatosis, 110 with steatosis risk factors, 14 without risk factors) underwent proton MR spectroscopy and non-T1-weighted gradient-echo MR imaging of the liver. At spectroscopy, the reference FF was determined from frequency-selective measurements of fat and water proton densities. At imaging, FF was calculated by using two-, three-, or six-echo methods, with single-frequency and multifrequency fat signal modeling. The three- and six-echo methods corrected for T2*; the two-echo methods did not. For each imaging method, the fat estimation accuracy was assessed by using linear regression between the imaging FF and spectroscopic FF. Binary classification accuracy of imaging was assessed at four reference spectroscopic thresholds (0.04, 0.06, 0.08, and 0.10 FF).Regression intercept of two-, three-, and six-echo methods were -0.0211, 0.0087, and -0.0062 (P <.001 for all three) without multifrequency modeling and -0.0237 (P <.001), 0.0022, and -0.0007 with multifrequency modeling, respectively. Regression slope of two-, three-, and six-echo methods were 0.8522, 0.8528, and 0.7544 (P <.001 for all three) without multifrequency modeling and 0.9994, 0.9775, and 0.9821 with multifrequency modeling, respectively. Significant deviation of intercept and slope from 0 and 1, respectively, indicated systematic error. Classification accuracy was 82.2%-90.1%, 93.9%-96.3%, and 83.4%-89.6% for two-, three-, and six-echo methods without multifrequency modeling and 88.3%-92.0%, 95.1%-96.3%, and 94.5%-96.3% with multifrequency modeling, respectively, depending on the FF threshold. T2*-corrected (three- and six-echo) multifrequency imaging methods had the overall highest FF estimation and classification accuracy. Among methods without multifrequency modeling, the T2-corrected three-echo method had the highest accuracy.Non-T1-weighted MR imaging with T2 correction and multifrequency modeling helps accurately estimate hepatic proton-density FF at 3.0 T.",
        "Purpose To determine the effect of intravenous (IV) low-osmolality iodinated contrast material (LOCM) on the development of post\u2013computed tomography (CT) acute kidney injury (AKI), stratified by pre-CT estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), in patients with stable renal function. Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval was obtained and patient consent waived for this HIPAA-compliant, retrospective study. CT examinations performed over a 10-year period on unique adult inpatients with sufficient serum creatinine (SCr) data and stable renal function (difference between baseline and pre-CT SCr within 0.3 mg/dL and 50% of baseline) were identified. A 1:1 propensity score matched cohort analysis with multivariate analysis of effects was performed with post-CT AKI as the primary outcome measure (8826 nonenhanced and 8826 IV contrast agent\u2013enhanced CT studies in 17 652 patients). Propensity matching was performed with respect to likelihood of receiving IV contrast material (19 tested covariates). Post-CT AKI with Acute Kidney Injury Network SCr criteria was the primary endpoint. A stepwise multivariate conditional logistic regression model was performed to identify the effect of IV LOCM on post-CT AKI. Results After 1:1 propensity matching, IV LOCM had a significant effect on the development of post-CT AKI (P = .04). This risk increased with decreases in pre-CT eGFR (\u226560 mL/min/1.73 m2: odds ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval: 0.86, 1.16; 45\u201359 mL/min/1.73 m2: odds ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval: 0.82, 1.38; 30\u201344 mL/min/1.73 m2: odds ratio, 1.40; 95% confidence interval: 1.00, 1.97; <30 mL/min/1.73 m2: odds ratio, 2.96; 95% confidence interval: 1.22, 7.17). Conclusion IV LOCM is a nephrotoxic risk factor in patients with a stable eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, with a trend toward significance at 30\u201344 mL/min/1.73 m2. IV LOCM does not appear to be a nephrotoxic risk factor in patients with a pre-CT eGFR of 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 or greater. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "To determine the appearance of breast lesions at quantitative ultrasonographic (US) elastography by using supersonic shear imaging (SSI) and to assess the correlation between quantitative values of lesion stiffness and pathologic results, which were used as the reference standard.This study was approved by the French National Committee for the Protection of Patients Participating in Biomedical Research Programs. All patients provided written informed consent. Conventional US and SSI quantitative elastography were performed in 46 women (mean age, 57.6 years; age range, 38-71 years) with 48 breast lesions (28 benign, 20 malignant; mean size, 14.7 mm); pathologic results were available in all cases. Quantitative lesion elasticity was measured in terms of the Young modulus (in kilopascals). Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve were obtained by using a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to assess diagnostic performance.All breast lesions were detected at SSI. Malignant lesions exhibited a mean elasticity value of 146.6 kPa +/- 40.05 (standard deviation), whereas benign ones had an elasticity value of 45.3 kPa +/- 41.1 (P < .001). Complicated cysts were differentiated from solid lesions because they had elasticity values of 0 kPa (no signal was retrieved from liquid areas).SSI provides quantitative elasticity measurements, thus adding complementary information that potentially could help in breast lesion characterization with B-mode US.",
        "Purpose To compare the low-contrast detectability and image quality of computed tomography (CT) at different radiation dose levels reconstructed with iterative reconstruction (IR) and filtered back projection (FBP). Materials and Methods A custom liver phantom with 12 simulated hypoattenuating tumors (diameters of 5, 10, 15, and 20 mm; tumor-to-liver contrast values of \u221210, \u221220, and \u221240 HU) was designed. The phantom was scanned with a standard abdominal CT protocol with a volume CT dose index of 21.6 mGy (equivalent 100% dose) and four low-dose protocols (20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% of the standard protocol dose). CT data sets were reconstructed with IR and FBP. Image noise was measured, and the tumors' contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were calculated. Tumor detection was independently assessed by three radiologists who were blinded to the CT technique used. A total of 840 simulated tumors were presented to the radiologists. Statistical analyses included analysis of variance. Results IR yielded an image noise reduction of 43.9%\u201363.9% and a CNR increase of 74.1%\u2013180% compared with FBP at the same dose level (P < .001). The overall sensitivity for tumor detection was 64.7%\u201385.3% for IR and 66.3%\u201385.7% for FBP at the 20%\u2013100% doses, respectively. There was no significant difference in the sensitivity for tumor detection between IR and FBP at the same dose level (P = .99). The sensitivity of the protocol at the 20% dose with FBP and IR was significantly lower than that of the protocol at the 100% dose with FBP and IR (P = .019). Conclusion As the radiation dose at CT decreases, the IR algorithm does not preserve the low-contrast detectability. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Supplemental material:S1",
        "To evaluate the diagnostic performance of contrast material-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) angiography for preoperative detection and localization of accessory pudendal arteries (APAs) in patients with prostate cancer.This prospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained. Between July 2007 and December 2010, 127 patients underwent contrast-enhanced MR angiography following prostate MR imaging at 3.0 T before robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP). APAs were defined as any arteries located in the periprostatic region and anastomosed with the common penile artery or its branches; they were then subclassified into lateral and apical APAs. For detecting and localizing APAs, MR angiograms were evaluated prospectively by one reader and retrospectively by two independent blinded readers. Diagnostic performance was determined on a per-patient basis by using surgical findings as the reference standard. In addition, the origin of APAs identified at both surgery and contrast-enhanced MR angiography was determined by consensus of two retrospective readers. Interreader agreements were assessed by using k statistics.At surgery, 19 APAs (seven right apical, three left apical, four right lateral, and five left lateral) were detected in 16 patients, and 16 of these APAs were localized in 13 patients at preoperative contrast-enhanced MR angiography. Prospectively, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of contrast-enhanced MR angiography for the localization of APAs were 81.3%, 93.7%, and 92.1%, while retrospectively they were 87.5%, 91.9%, and 91.3% for reader 2 and 75.0%, 90.1%, and 88.2% for reader 3, respectively. Overall interreader agreement was substantial (k = 0.795). Nine and seven APAs originated from the obturator artery and the inferior vesical artery, respectively.Contrast-enhanced MR angiography can be used for the preoperative detection of APAs in patients with prostate cancer.",
        "Purpose To determine if adding shear-wave elastography (SWE) to second-look ultrasonography (US) after breast dynamic contrast material\u2013enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging helps find or target lesions seen on DCE MR images for US-guided biopsy. Materials and Methods This HIPAA-compliant prospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained from patients. From May 2011 to July 2012, 73 women with 96 Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) category 4 or 5 lesions after DCE MR imaging prospectively consented to undergo SWE during second-look US. If a lesion was not confidently seen with B-mode US, SWE during real-time scanning was performed to determine if SWE helped find or target lesions for US biopsy. A qualitative SWE six-point color scale was used to record the maximum elasticity in and around lesions. All lesions underwent US or DCE MR imaging\u2013guided core biopsy. Results Median participant age was 52 years (range, 21\u201381 years). In 72 patients who underwent DCE MR imaging, 96 BI-RADS category 4 or 5 lesions were detected in 81 breasts. There were 29 (30%) malignancies (one malignancy was of nonbreast origin), 14 (15%) high-risk lesions, and 53 (55%) benign lesions. US revealed 22 cancers, and seven cancers were detected only with MR imaging. Real-time SWE helped find one lesion and target four lesions that were incompletely assessed with gray-scale US. These five lesions that were localized or targeted for biopsy were invasive cancers, representing 23% of the 22 malignancies detected with US. Conclusion Real-time SWE added to second-look US after DCE MR imaging increased the detection rate of cancers and helped target cancers for US-guided biopsy. \u00a9 RSNA, 2014",
        "To measure and compare the dimensions of the sustentaculum tali (ST) in pediatric patients with unilateral subtalar coalition to determine if the contralateral side has altered morphology.The institutional review board approved this study, which was HIPAA compliant. Informed consent was waived. Radiology records were reviewed to identify 35 patients with unilateral subtalar coalition undergoing computed tomography (CT) (21 male, 14 female; mean age, 14.54 years) and 33 control patients with triplane fracture (21 male, 12 female; mean age, 13.48 years). CT images were reviewed, and reformatted images through the subtalar joint (on the side opposite the coalition) were created. Anteroposterior measurements of the middle facet (MF) and the ST were recorded by two observers with electronic calipers. The MF/ST ratio and the ST length extending posterior to the MF were calculated. Measurements between groups were compared by using Wald tests based on linear regressions. Inter- and intraobserver variabilities were determined by means of a component of variance model.The lengths of the MF and ST for the study and control groups were 12.86 and 16.82 mm (P < .001) and 23.83 and 22.06 mm (P = .053), respectively. Intra- and interobserver correlations for both measurements were 0.94 and 0.92 and 0.86 and 0.77, respectively. MF/ST ratio was 0.54 versus 0.76 (P < .001), and ST length extending posterior to the MF was 10.97 versus 5.24 mm (P < .001).The MF is smaller and the ST extends further beyond the MF in patients with a contralateral subtalar coalition than in control patients.

        "To study the incidence, pathogenesis, imaging characteristics, and clinical importance of a unique subtype of epidural hematoma (EDH) associated with blunt head trauma.This study was reviewed and approved by the hospital's Institutional Review Board and was compliant with HIPAA. Informed consent was waived. The investigation was a retrospective study of 200 patients with acute supratentorial EDH, defined as a biconvex, high-attenuating, extraaxial hematoma. A subgroup of 21 patients in whom the EDH was located at the anterior aspect of the middle cranial fossa was defined. Computed tomographic images and inpatient medical records of these 21 patients were evaluated for imaging characteristics of the EDH, presence or absence of associated fracture, presence or absence of midline shift and/or mass effect, additional intracranial injury, and hospital clinical course.Twenty-one (10.5%) of 200 traumatic EDHs localized to the anterior middle cranial fossa. All of these 21 anterior temporal EDHs were juxtaposed to the sphenoparietal sinus, and all but one were limited laterally by the sphenotemporal suture and medially by the orbital fissure; none extended above the lesser sphenoid wing. Maximum thickness was less than 1 cm in 13 (62%) of 21 and less than 2 cm in 20 (95%) of 21 patients. Isolated fractures of the greater sphenoid wing and ipsilateral zygomaticomaxillary fractures were present in 12 (57%) of 21 and nine (43%) of 21 patients, respectively. Concomitant intracranial injury was identified in 15 (71%) of 21 patients. Twenty (95%) of 21 lesions were present at the admission study, and all 21 were stable or smaller at follow-up imaging. No patient required neurosurgical intervention of their anterior temporal EDH.Acute EDHs isolated to the anterior aspect of the middle cranial fossa constitute a subgroup of traumatic EDHs with a benign natural history. It is postulated that they arise from venous bleeding due to disruption of the sphenoparietal sinus.",
        "Incomplete reporting has been identified as a major source of avoidable waste in biomedical research. Essential information is often not provided in study reports, impeding the identification, critical appraisal, and replication of studies. To improve the quality of reporting of diagnostic accuracy studies, the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (STARD) statement was developed. Here we present STARD 2015, an updated list of 30 essential items that should be included in every report of a diagnostic accuracy study. This update incorporates recent evidence about sources of bias and variability in diagnostic accuracy and is intended to facilitate the use of STARD. As such, STARD 2015 may help to improve completeness and transparency in reporting of diagnostic accuracy studies.",
        "The purpose of this statement is to describe and define the phenotypic abnormalities that can be identified on visual and quantitative evaluation of computed tomographic (CT) images in subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), with the goal of contributing to a personalized approach to the treatment of patients with COPD. Quantitative CT is useful for identifying and sequentially evaluating the extent of emphysematous lung destruction, changes in airway walls, and expiratory air trapping. However, visual assessment of CT scans remains important to describe patterns of altered lung structure in COPD. The classification system proposed and illustrated in this article provides a structured approach to visual and quantitative assessment of COPD. Emphysema is classified as centrilobular (subclassified as trace, mild, moderate, confluent, and advanced destructive emphysema), panlobular, and paraseptal (subclassified as mild or substantial). Additional important visual features include airway wall thickening, inflammatory small airways disease, tracheal abnormalities, interstitial lung abnormalities, pulmonary arterial enlargement, and bronchiectasis.",
        "Purpose To investigate relationships between computer-extracted breast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging phenotypes with multigene assays of MammaPrint, Oncotype DX, and PAM50 to assess the role of radiomics in evaluating the risk of breast cancer recurrence. Materials and Methods Analysis was conducted on an institutional review board-approved retrospective data set of 84 deidentified, multi-institutional breast MR examinations from the National Cancer Institute Cancer Imaging Archive, along with clinical, histopathologic, and genomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The data set of biopsy-proven invasive breast cancers included 74 (88%) ductal, eight (10%) lobular, and two (2%) mixed cancers. Of these, 73 (87%) were estrogen receptor positive, 67 (80%) were progesterone receptor positive, and 19 (23%) were human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive. For each case, computerized radiomics of the MR images yielded computer-extracted tumor phenotypes of size, shape, margin morphology, enhancement texture, and kinetic assessment. Regression and receiver operating characteristic analysis were conducted to assess the predictive ability of the MR radiomics features relative to the multigene assay classifications. Results Multiple linear regression analyses demonstrated significant associations (R2 = 0.25-0.32, r = 0.5-0.56, P < .0001) between radiomics signatures and multigene assay recurrence scores. Important radiomics features included tumor size and enhancement texture, which indicated tumor heterogeneity. Use of radiomics in the task of distinguishing between good and poor prognosis yielded area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 0.88 (standard error, 0.05), 0.76 (standard error, 0.06), 0.68 (standard error, 0.08), and 0.55 (standard error, 0.09) for MammaPrint, Oncotype DX, PAM50 risk of relapse based on subtype, and PAM50 risk of relapse based on subtype and proliferation, respectively, with all but the latter showing statistical difference from chance. Conclusion Quantitative breast MR imaging radiomics shows promise for image-based phenotyping in assessing the risk of breast cancer recurrence. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Introduction: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive disorder causing red blood cell sickling, vasooclusion and haemolysis. Doppler ultrasonography of the renal vessels provides a non-invasive method of investigating renal diseases which includes sickle cell nephropathy.\r\nAims and objective: To compare the renal dimensions and renal artery resistive index (RI) in children with sickle cell disease with those of healthy children.\r\nMethodology: This prospective study was conducted from May, 2013 to December, 2013.\r\n50 patients with SCD and 50 apparently healthy children matched for age were recruited for this study. Ultrasound assessment of the kidney including the renal dimension and Doppler scan of the interlobar artery of the kidneys was performed.\r\nResults: The mean renal length (RL) in children with SCD is 8.5\u00b11.29 cm on the right side (RT) and 8.5\u00b11.34 cm on the left side (LT). The mean RL in the control is 7.8\u00b11.2 cm on the RT and 8.0\u00b11.26 cm on the LT. The cortical thickness (CT) in children with SCD is 1.0\u00b10.24cm on the RT and 1.1\u00b10.20cm on the LT. The CT in the control is 0.9\u00b10.24cm on the RT and 0.9\u00b10.28cm on the LT. The RI in children with SCD is 0.7\u00b10.06 on the RT and 0.8\u00b10.05 on the LT. The RI in the control group is 0.6\u00b10.05 on RT and 0.6\u00b10.06 on the LT. The PSV is children with SCD is 77.5\u00b122.3 on the RT and 83.0\u00b120.53 on the LT. The PSV in the control group is 67.2\u00b118.78 on the RT and 74.4\u00b119.58 on the LT. The RL, CT, RI and PSV were found to be higher in SCD patient when compared with the control.\r\nConclusion: The mean renal length, cortical thickness, RI and PSV was found to be higher in children with SCD than the control group.",
        "To assess the extent to which multiple Alzheimer disease (AD) biomarkers improve the ability to predict future decline in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) compared with predictions based on clinical parameters alone.All protocols were approved by the institutional review board at each site, and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. The study was HIPAA compliant. Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) baseline magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) studies for 97 subjects with MCI were used. MR imaging-derived gray matter probability maps and FDG PET images were analyzed by using independent component analysis, an unbiased data-driven method to extract independent sources of information from whole-brain data. The loading parameters for all MR imaging and FDG components, along with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins, were entered into logistic regression models (dependent variable: conversion to AD within 4 years). Eight models were considered, including all combinations of MR imaging, PET, and CSF markers with the covariates (age, education, apolipoprotein E genotype, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale score).Combining MR imaging, FDG PET, and CSF data with routine clinical tests significantly increased the accuracy of predicting conversion to AD compared with clinical testing alone. The misclassification rate decreased from 41.3% to 28.4% (P < .00001). FDG PET contributed more information to routine tests (P < .00001) than CSF (P = .32) or MR imaging (P = .08).Imaging and CSF biomarkers can improve prediction of conversion from MCI to AD compared with baseline clinical testing. FDG PET appears to add the greatest prognostic information.",
        "History A 57-year-old woman was referred to our institute in 2010 by a neurologist for a follow-up brain magnetic resonance (MR) examination. She had not experienced any acute change in symptoms, but unspecific unilateral hyperintensities in her left cerebral hemisphere had been noted at a previous MR examination in 2004. Since 2001, she had been repeatedly seen in neurology departments for recurrent episodes of clumsiness of her left hand and frequent headaches. Her other medical history was unremarkable, as were the findings of a neurologic examination. She was not born prematurely, she was not hypertensive, and she had not shown signs or symptoms suggestive of immune incompetence or autoimmune disease. There was no history of meningitis or encephalitis. A source for embolic foci could not be established. Serology indicated no previous cysticercosis infection. Her laboratory test results were normal. Since no other underlying cause had been previously considered, a radiologist from another institute postulated that her left hemispheric hyperintensities could be seen as a rudimentary expression of tuberous sclerosis lacking the classic clinical triad. The MR examination in our institution was performed to rule out progression. The resulting images were compared with those obtained in 2004.",
        "Introduction: The measurement of knee joint space width (JSW), between the distal femur and the proximal tibia is an indirect way of measuring the tibio-femoral cartilage thickness, which is considered a valuable parameter, in assessing knee cartilage disease. This study is aimed at establishing normal references of JSW for use in diagnosis and follow up of knee cartilage diseases.\r\nMaterials and Methods: This prospective study was conducted on 300 fixed-flexion erect knee computed radiographs of one hundred and sixty adults. The JSW of both medial and lateral compartments of each knee was measured using in-built electronic calipers.Results: The mean right medial and lateral JSW measured 4.74 mm +0.75 and 5.63 mm +0.86 respectively. The mean left medial and lateral JSW measured 4.74 mm + 0.76 and 5.66 mm + 0.87. No statistically significant difference was found between right and left knee JSW compartments.\r\nConclusion: The radiographic reference values for the knee JSW was obtained, showing no significant gender variation in knee JSW. However, there is decrease in JSW with increasing age.",
        "To characterize the position, shape, and orientation of the long biceps tendon (LBT) on transverse magnetic resonance (MR) images acquired in neutral position and in maximal external and internal rotation of the shoulder in asymptomatic volunteers.Informed consent was obtained from all volunteers for this institutional review board-approved study. Fifty-three asymptomatic volunteers (mean age, 33 years; age range, 21-58 years) were included. The position of the LBT with respect to the bicipital groove was measured by two musculoskeletal radiologists on three levels along the bicipital groove on axial MR images in neutral position and in external and internal rotation of the shoulder. The shape of the LBT was classified as round, oval, flat, or comma shaped, and the orientation of the LBT was measured.The position of the LBT changed significantly at the entrance into the bicipital groove in the mediolateral and anteroposterior directions (P < .01). The changes of LBT position in external rotation and internal rotation compared with the neutral position were markedly small (< 1.5 mm). Medial eccentricity of the LBT was greatest in the neutral shoulder position at all measurement levels. Differences in LBT shape and orientation were found between the neutral position and external or internal rotation and between the three measurement levels.The position of the LBT is only slightly dependent on shoulder rotation. LBT eccentricity is maximal in the neutral position. Rotational misplacement during image acquisition does not increase LBT eccentricity.",
        "To test the hypothesis that in patients with unilateral patellofemoral instability ( PI patellofemoral instability ), the contralateral asymptomatic joints have abnormal morphology and imaging features of osteoarthritis ( OA osteoarthritis ) at four-dimensional ( 4D four-dimensional ) computed tomography (CT).The institutional review board approved this HIPAA-compliant retrospective study. Informed consent was waived. Radiology records were reviewed to identify 25 patients (male-female ratio, 0.56; median age, 20 years; range, 13-43 years) with unilateral PI patellofemoral instability undergoing 4D four-dimensional CT and 25 age- and sex-matched control patients undergoing multidetector CT. Trochlear groove depth ( TGD trochlear groove depth ), tibial tuberosity-trochlear groove ( TT-TG tibial tuberosity-trochlear groove ) distance, and patellar height ratio ( PHR patellar height ratio ) were determined to compare morphology, and bisect offset ( BO bisect offset ) measurements were obtained to compare lateral displacement of the patella between the two groups by using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. All images were interpreted by trained observers. Tracking patterns of the patellae were determined by obtaining BO bisect offset measurements at various flexion angles with 4D four-dimensional CT.In the contralateral asymptomatic joints, TGD trochlear groove depth (median, 3.0 mm; 95% confidence interval [ CI confidence interval ]: 2.5, 4.6; P < .0001), TT-TG tibial tuberosity-trochlear groove (median, 15 mm; 95% CI confidence interval : 12.7, 18; P = .008), PHR patellar height ratio (median, 1.17; 95% CI confidence interval : 1.09, 1.2; P = .002), and patellar lateral displacement ( BO bisect offset , 85%; 95% CI confidence interval : 76.2%, 98.2%; P < .0001) were different from measurements obtained in the control group: TGD trochlear groove depth median, 5.0 mm (95% CI confidence interval : 2.2, 7.6); TT-TG tibial tuberosity-trochlear groove median, 10.9 mm (95% CI confidence interval : 3.4, 20.7); PHR patellar height ratio median, 0.92 (95% CI confidence interval : 0.67, 1.36); and BO bisect offset median, 63% (95% CI confidence interval : 59%, 68.4%). OA osteoarthritis was detected in 40% of asymmetrical contralateral joints (10 of 25). By using 4D four-dimensional CT data, multiple regression analysis demonstrated that TGD trochlear groove depth (P = .026) and BO bisect offset measurements obtained at 30\u00b0 of knee flexion (P = .047) had an association with the presence of OA osteoarthritis .Abnormal morphology and imaging features of OA osteoarthritis are relatively common in contralateral asymptomatic joints of young patients with unilateral PI patellofemoral instability .",
        "Purpose To determine the accuracy of computed tomography (CT) in identifying the histopathologic usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern in rheumatoid arthritis\u2013associated interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD). Materials and Methods All patients were enrolled into institutional review board-approved longitudinal cohorts at their respective institution, and informed consent was obtained at the time of enrollment. Images of patients with surgical lung biopsy-proved RA-ILD (n = 69) were collected from three tertiary care centers. Two experienced thoracic radiologists independently reviewed the CT scans. The CT pattern was categorized as definite UIP, possible UIP, or inconsistent with UIP in accordance with published criteria. Findings of biopsies were reviewed by an experienced lung pathologist. The sensitivity and specificity of definite CT UIP pattern to histopathologic UIP pattern were determined. The agreement between radiologists was assessed by calculating a \u03ba score. Results The histopathologic UIP pattern was present in 42 of 69 (61%) patients. Men were more likely than women to have a histopathologic UIP pattern (P = .02). Twenty patients (29%, 20 of 69) had a definite UIP pattern on CT scans. The specificity of CT UIP pattern was 96% (26 of 27; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 81%, 100%), with a negative predictive value of 53% (26 of 49). The sensitivity of CT UIP pattern was 45% (19 of 42; 95% CI: 30%, 61%), with a positive predictive value of 95% (19 of 20). The agreement between radiologists for definite UIP pattern versus not was 87% (\u03ba = 0.67, P < .0001). Conclusion Definite UIP pattern on a CT scan in RA-ILD is highly specific and moderately sensitive for histopathologic UIP pattern. CT can therefore help accurately identify the UIP pattern in RA-ILD. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To compare the histologic prognostic feature of invasive breast cancer with mean stiffness as measured with shear-wave elastography.This retrospective study was exempted from ethical committee review. Patient consent for use of images for research was obtained. The study group comprised 101 consecutive women (age range, 38-91 years) with solid lesions identified during routine breast ultrasonography (US) performed between April 2010 and March 2011 and subsequently confirmed at histologic examination to be invasive cancers. Four elastographic images in two orthogonal planes were obtained of each lesion, and mean stiffness values were obtained from each image. Histologic findings following surgery were used for comparison, namely histologic grade, tumor type, invasive size, vascular invasion status, and lymph node status. Relationship between mean stiffness and histologic parameters was investigated by using a general linear model and multiple regression analysis.High histologic grade (P < .0001), large invasive size (P < .0001), lymph node involvement (P < .0001), tumor type (P < .0001), and vascular invasion (P = .0077) all showed statistically significant positive association with high mean stiffness values. Multiple linear regression indicated that invasive size is the strongest pathologic determinant of mean stiffness (P < .0001), with histologic grade also having significant influence (P = .022).In this study, breast cancers with higher mean stiffness values at shear-wave elastography had poorer prognostic features.",
        "History An asymptomatic 33-year-old woman was referred to the Hepatology Department in 2013 for work-up of indeterminate multifocal liver masses. These lesions were discovered incidentally at multiphase contrast material\u2013enhanced multidetector computed tomography (CT) performed in 2004 to investigate right lower quadrant pain. Imaging surveillance at sporadic intervals revealed slow progressive growth of the lesions over time; however, the number of lesions remained constant. There was no history of cancer, nor were there predisposing factors for chronic liver disease or cirrhosis. The patient had a history of menorrhagia, which was managed with oral contraceptive use for 20 years; this was stopped in 2013 after hysterectomy. The patient\u2019s \u03b3-glutamyl transferase (77 U/L [1.28 \u03bckat/L]; normal level, <55 U/L [<0.92 \u03bckat/L]) and C-reactive protein (97.1 mg/L [924.8 nmol/L]; normal level, <8 mg/L [<76.2 nmol/L]]) levels were chronically elevated at serum testing. In 2013, 9 years after the initial CT examination, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with gadoxetic acid (Primovist; Bayer Healthcare, Whippany, NJ) was performed. Finally, ultrasonography (US)-guided biopsy of one of the lesions (in segment 5/6) was performed a year after MR imaging.",
        "To compare the efficacies of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and sorafenib in patients with advanced-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).The retrospective analysis of the data was approved by the institutional review board; the requirement to obtain informed consent was waived. Three hundred seventy-two patients with HCC were treated between January 1999 and December 2009. Patients with advanced HCC according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging classification (Child-Pugh class A or B, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1-2, and/or macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic metastasis) were included in the study (n = 97). Thirty-four patients underwent conventional TACE with doxorubicin plus lipiodol or TACE with drug-eluting beads; 63 patients were treated with sorafenib.The median duration of sorafenib treatment was 4.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.2, 6.0 months). The median number of TACE sessions per patient was 3 \u00b1 2. Side effects of TACE and sorafenib were comparable to those reported in the literature. The median time to progression was similar between the two treatment groups (P = .737). The median overall survival was 9.2 months (95% CI: 6.1, 12.3 months) for patients treated with TACE and 7.4 months (95% CI: 5.6, 9.2 months) for those treated with sorafenib (P = .377). Only Child-Pugh class was associated with a better overall survival at uni- and multivariate analysis.TACE achieved a promising outcome in select patients with advanced HCC (BCLC stage C).",
        "To demonstrate the feasibility of foot blood flow measurement by using dynamic volume perfusion computed tomographic (CT) technique with the upslope method in an animal experiment and a human study.The human study was approved by the institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. The animal study was approved by the research animal care and use committee. A perfusion CT experiment was first performed by using rabbits. A color-coded perfusion map was reconstructed by using in-house perfusion analysis software based on the upslope method, and the measured blood flow on the map was compared with the reference standard microsphere method by using correlation analysis. A total of 17 perfusion CT sessions were then performed (a) once in five human patients and (b) twice (before and after endovascular revascularization) in six human patients. Perfusion maps of blood flow were reconstructed and analyzed. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to prove significant differences in blood flow before and after treatment.The animal experiment demonstrated a strong correlation (R(2) = 0.965) in blood flow between perfusion CT and the microsphere method. Perfusion maps were obtained successfully in 16 human clinical sessions (94%) with the use of 32 mL of contrast medium and an effective radiation dose of 0.31 mSv (k factor for the ankle, 0.0002). The plantar dermis showed the highest blood flow among all anatomic structures of the foot, including muscle, subcutaneous tissue, tendon, and bone. After a successful revascularization procedure, the blood flow of the plantar dermis increased by 153% (P = .031). The interpretations of the color-coded perfusion map correlated well with the clinical and angiographic findings.Perfusion CT could be used to measure foot blood flow in both animals and humans. It can be a useful modality for the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease by providing quantitative information on foot perfusion status.",
        "To compare the performance of two versions of reconstructed two-dimensional (2D) images in combination with digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) versus the performance of standard full-field digital mammography (FFDM) plus DBT.This trial had ethical committee approval, and all participants gave written informed consent. Examinations (n = 24 901) in women between the ages of 50 and 69 years (mean age, 59.2 years) were interpreted prospectively as part of a screening trial that included independent interpretations of FFDM plus DBT and reconstructed 2D images plus DBT. Reconstructed 2D images do not require radiation exposure. Using analyses for binary data that accounted for correlated interpretations and were adjusted for reader-specific volume, two versions (initial and current) of reconstructed 2D images used during trial periods 1 (from November 22, 2010, to December 21, 2011; 12 631 women) and 2 (from January 20, 2012, to December 19, 2012; 12 270 women) were compared in terms of cancer detection and false-positive rates with the corresponding FFDM plus DBT interpretations.Cancer detection rates were 8.0, 7.4, 7.8, and 7.7 per 1000 screening examinations for FFDM plus DBT in period 1, initial reconstructed 2D images plus DBT in period 1, FFDM plus DBT in period 2, and current reconstructed 2D images plus DBT in period 2, respectively. False-positive scores were 5.3%, 4.6%, 4.6%, and 4.5%, respectively. Corresponding reader-adjusted paired comparisons of false-positive scores revealed significant differences for period 1 (P = .012) but not for period 2 (ratio = 0.99; 95% confidence interval: 0.88, 1.11; P = .85).The combination of current reconstructed 2D images and DBT performed comparably to FFDM plus DBT and is adequate for routine clinical use when interpreting screening mammograms.",
        "Osteoporosis is becoming an increasingly important public health issue, and effective treatments to prevent fragility fractures are available. Osteoporosis imaging is of critical importance in identifying individuals at risk for fractures who would require pharmacotherapy to reduce fracture risk and also in monitoring response to treatment. Dual x-ray absorptiometry is currently the state-of-the-art technique to measure bone mineral density and to diagnose osteoporosis according to the World Health Organization guidelines. Motivated by a 2000 National Institutes of Health consensus conference, substantial research efforts have focused on assessing bone quality by using advanced imaging techniques. Among these techniques aimed at better characterizing fracture risk and treatment effects, high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (CT) currently plays a central role, and a large number of recent studies have used this technique to study trabecular and cortical bone architecture. Other techniques to analyze bone quality include multidetector CT, magnetic resonance imaging, and quantitative ultrasonography. In addition to quantitative imaging techniques measuring bone density and quality, imaging needs to be used to diagnose prevalent osteoporotic fractures, such as spine fractures on chest radiographs and sagittal multidetector CT reconstructions. Radiologists need to be sensitized to the fact that the presence of fragility fractures will alter patient care, and these fractures need to be described in the report. This review article covers state-of-the-art imaging techniques to measure bone mineral density, describes novel techniques to study bone quality, and focuses on how standard imaging techniques should be used to diagnose prevalent osteoporotic fractures. \u00a9 RSNA, 2012",
        "To demonstrate coronary sinus-left atrium connections and evaluate coronary sinus function and anatomy in detail by using multidetector computed tomography (CT).In this institutional review board-approved retrospective study, the authors evaluated coronary CT angiograms obtained in 65 patients with normal sinus rhythm (normal group) and seven with atrial fibrillation at CT (atrial fibrillation group). Coronary sinus-right atrium muscle continuity was indirectly evaluated by measuring the length of the coronary sinus contraction during atrial systole. The length, number, and extent of coronary sinus-left atrium connections were recorded. The accuracy of CT was validated by comparing microscopic images of autopsied hearts with corresponding CT images. Comparisons were performed by using Student t tests for continuous variables. P \u2264 .05 was considered indicative of a statistically significant difference.In the normal group, coronary sinus contraction was seen in 60 of the 65 patients (92%, mean length \u00b1 standard deviation, 25.7 mm \u00b1 8.0). The coronary sinus narrowed 26% from middiastole to atrial systole (P < .0001). Coronary sinus-left atrium muscle connections were seen in 58 of the 65 patients (89%). A single connection was seen in 43 of the 65 patients (66%), with a mean length of 21.0 mm \u00b1 14.0 within 12.0 mm \u00b1 11.0 of the coronary sinus ostium. In 10 of the 43 patients (26%) with single connections, the connection extended to the coronary sinus ostium. In 10 of the 65 patients (15%), the entire coronary sinus was attached to the left atrial wall. Fifteen patients (23%) had two connections; distal connections measured 9 mm \u00b1 2.4 in length within 2.2 mm \u00b1 3.8 of the coronary sinus ostium, and proximal connections measured 15.4 mm \u00b1 10.0 in length within 24.0 mm \u00b1 8.0 of the coronary sinus ostium. In seven patients (11%), no coronary sinus-left atrium connection was seen; however, all showed a coronary sinus constriction during atrial systole, indicating that coronary sinus-right atrium muscle continuity is likely the primary cause for coronary sinus contractions. In the atrial fibrillation group, no coronary sinus contraction was seen. All images in the atrial fibrillation group showed a coronary sinus-left atrium connection, which was single in five patients and double in two. The area of the coronary sinus during diastole was larger in the atrial fibrillation group than in the normal group (114 mm(2) \u00b1 37 vs 77 mm(2) \u00b1 40, respectively; P = .02).CT can provide excellent information about coronary sinus function and coronary sinus-left atrium muscle connections.",
        "To investigate the clinical usefulness of ultrasonography-based acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography (ie, ARFI sonoelastography) in patients with a diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and compare ARFI sonoelastography results with transient sonoelastography and serum fibrosis marker test results.Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects, and the local ethics committee approved the study. Fifty-four patients with a liver biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of NAFLD (mean age, 50.6 years +/- 13.7) were examined. All patients with NAFLD and healthy volunteers underwent ARFI sonoelastography, transient sonoelastography, and serum liver fibrosis marker testing (hyaluronic acids, type IV collagen 7 S domain). Ten healthy volunteers underwent ARFI sonoelastography. ARFI sonoelastography results were compared with liver biopsy findings, the reference standard. ARFI sonoelastography findings were compared with liver biopsy, transient sonoelastography, and serum fibrosis marker test results. Student t testing was used for univariate comparisons; Kruskal-Wallis testing, for assessments involving more than two independent groups; and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (A(z)), to assess the sensitivity and specificity of ARFI sonoelastography for detection of stage 3 and stage 4 fibrosis.Median velocities in the patients with NAFLD were 1.040 m/sec for those with stage 0 fibrosis, 1.120 m/sec for those with stage 1, 1.130 m/sec for those with stage 2, 1.780 m/sec for those with stage 3, and 2.180 m/sec for those with stage 4. The A(z) for the diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis stages 3 or higher was 0.973 (optimal cutoff value, 1.77 m/sec; sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 91%), while that for the diagnosis of stage 4 fibrosis was 0.976 (optimal cutoff value, 1.90 m/sec; sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 96%). Significant correlations between median velocity measured by using ARFI sonoelastography and the following parameters were observed: liver stiffness measured with transient sonoelastography (r = 0.75, P < .0001), serum level of hyaluronic acid(r = 0.459, P = .0009), and serum level of type IV collagen 7 S domain (r = 0.445, P = .0015).There is a significant positive correlation between median velocity measured by using ARFI sonoelastography and severity of liver fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. The results of ARFI sonoelastography were similar to those of transient sonoelastography.",
        "To compare image quality obtained in phantoms with virtual monochromatic spectral (VMS) imaging with that obtained with conventional 120-kVp computed tomography (CT) for a given radiation dose.Three syringes were filled with a diluted contrast medium (each syringe contained a contrast medium with a different iodine concentration [5, 10, or 15 mg of iodine per milliliter]), and a fourth syringe was filled with water. These syringes were placed in a torso phantom meant to simulate the standard human physique. The phantom was examined with a CT system and use of the fast kilovoltage switching (80 and 140 kVp) and conventional (120 kVp) modes. Image noise and contrast-to-noise (CNR) ratio were analyzed on VMS images and 120-kVp CT images.Image noise on VMS images in the range of 67-72 keV was significantly lower than that on the 120-kVp CT images (P < .014). Image noise was lowest at 69 keV and was 12% lower when compared with that on 120-kVp CT images. CNR on the VMS images was highest at 68 keV. CNR on the VMS images obtained at 68 keV in the syringes filled with diluted contrast material (5, 10, and 15 mg of iodine per milliliter) was 28%, 31%, and 30% higher, respectively, compared with that on the 120-kVp CT images (P < .001).VMS imaging at approximately 70 keV yielded lower image noise and higher CNR than did 120-kVp CT for a given radiation dose. VMS imaging has the potential to replace 120-kVp CT as the standard CT imaging modality, since optimal VMS imaging may be expected to yield improved image quality in a patient with standard body habitus.",
        "Thyroid gland enlargement as a result of iodine deficiency is known as goitre. Prevalence of goitre in school\u2013age children is an important indicator of iodine deficiency in a population and prevalence greater than or equal to 5% in this age group constitutes a public health problem. Thus school-age children are the recommended target group for goitre screening.\r\nHigh resolution ultrasonography is documented as the gold standard for evaluation of the thyroid gland in children as it can give exquisite morphological definition and two dimensional image measurements of the gland without adding much to scanning time.\r\nThe aim of this study is to determine the sonographic thyroid gland volume in asymptomatic school-age children in Benin-City, Nigeria. Reviewed literatures had shown that, local reference values are better than World Health Organization/ International Council for the Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders (WHO/ICCIDD) values which are based on Caucasian population.\r\nFive hundred subjects, made up of 227 boys and 273 girls had their thyroid gland examined, by inspection and palpation, in addition to ultrasonography of the thyroid. A written informed consent from their guardians was obtained. The age range of the study population\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas 6 to 16 years, with male: female ratio of 1: 1.2, and a median age of 10 years.\r\nThe study recorded a median total thyroid gland volume for the entire population as 2.32cm3 (2.33cm3 for boys and 2.31cm3 for girls). The total median Body Surface Area (BSA) of the subjects was found to be1.10 (1.20 for boys and 1.10 for girls).\r\nThe median anteroposterior, mediolateral and craniocaudal dimensions of the right and left lobes of the thyroid gland in both boys and girls were 1.06cm, 1.01cm, 2.38cm and 1.01cm, 1.06cm, 2.41cm respectively.\r\nThe values obtained in this study were significantly lower than those reported by WHO/ICCIDD 1997 (P 0.05) between the dimensions obtained for boys and girls and both thyroid lobes.\r\nThe author thus proposes that the values obtained from this study could be used as reliable reference criteria for determination of the thyroid size of children in our local population. Ultrasonography is a cost effective, readily available and affordable modality that is practicable for screening and clinical use in resource poor settings such as developing countries like Nigeria.",
        "Purpose To evaluate whether completeness of reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses in major radiology journals has changed since publication of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement; a secondary objective is to evaluate whether completeness of reporting (ie, PRISMA) is associated with study quality (ie, Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews [AMSTAR]). Materials and Methods Systematic reviews and meta-analyses published in major radiology journals between January 2007 and December 2011 were identified by searching MEDLINE with the modified Montori method. Studies were reviewed independently by two investigators and assessed for adherence to the AMSTAR and PRISMA checklists. The average results were analyzed to assess for change in mean score before and after PRISMA publication and to assess results over time; a Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated to assess for any association between PRISMA and AMSTAR results. Results Included were 130 studies from 11 journals. Average PRISMA and AMSTAR results were 21.8 of 27 and 7.2 of 11, respectively. The average result was higher after publication of PRISMA, and PRISMA-reported items were 22.6 of 27 after publication of PRISMA versus 20.9 of 27 before publication of PRISMA; AMSTAR results were 7.7 of 11 after publication of PRISMA versus 6.7 of 11 before publication of PRISMA. There was a strong positive correlation (r = 0.86) between the PRISMA and AMSTAR results. There was high variability between journals. Radiology had the highest PRISMA reported items (24.7 of 27), and American Journal of Neuroradiology had the lowest (19.6 of 27). Two major areas for improvement include study protocol registration and assessment of risk of bias across studies (ie, publication bias). Conclusion In major radiology journal studies, there was modest improvement in completeness of reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, assessed by PRISMA, which was strongly associated with higher study quality, assessed by AMSTAR. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Supplemental material: S1 Erratum in: https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.14144019",
        "To evaluate the feasibility of delayed gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the cartilage of metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) compared with that in control subjects.Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained. Thirty-one MCP joints in 10 patients with RA (mean age, 59 years; range, 35-77 years) and six healthy volunteers (mean age, 51 years; range, 30-71 years) were examined with delayed gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging of cartilage. Sagittal images of the second and third MCP joints (hereafter, MCP II and MCP III) were acquired with a three-dimensional dual-flip-angle gradient-echo sequence at 3.0 T. B(1) field inhomogeneity-corrected T1 maps were calculated, and delayed gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging of cartilage values for phalangeal and metacarpal cartilage were determined. In addition, cartilage thickness was measured. A nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess differences between groups.Phalangeal and metacarpal delayed gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging of cartilage values in patients with RA (MCP II: 388 msec \u00b1 105 [standard deviation] and 342 msec \u00b1 79, respectively; MCP III: 409 msec \u00b1 96 and 371 msec \u00b1 89, respectively) were significantly lower than in control subjects (MCP II: 598 msec \u00b1 62 and 560 msec \u00b1 51, respectively; MCP III: 586 msec \u00b1 57 and 561 msec \u00b1 80, respectively). Cartilage thickness of both joints was comparable in patients with RA (MCP II: 1.28 mm \u00b1 0.50, MCP III: 1.17 mm \u00b1 0.24) and control subjects (MCP II: 1.42 mm \u00b1 0.33, MCP III: 1.18 mm \u00b1 0.26).Delayed gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging of cartilage of the MCP joints is feasible at 3.0 T. Delayed gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging of cartilage may help to assess cartilage degeneration in morphologically normal-appearing MCP II and III cartilage in patients with RA.",
        "Purpose To test the hypothesis that whole-body metabolic tumor burden (MTBWB) on postsurgical fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomographic (PET)/computed tomographic (CT) images in patients with non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is associated with their overall survival (OS). Materials and Methods The institutional review board approved this study and waived the requirement for obtaining informed consent. One hundred forty-two patients with NSCLC (69 men, 73 women; median age, 67.7 years) who underwent postsurgical FDG PET/CT were retrospectively reviewed. The whole-body metabolic tumor volume (MTVWB), whole-body total lesion glycolysis (TLGWB), and whole-body maximum standardized uptake value (SUVWBmax) were measured. OS served as the primary end point of the study. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression were used to assess the association between PET/CT markers and OS. Results The interobserver variability was low, as demonstrated with intraclass correlation coefficients higher than 0.94 for SUVWBmax, MTVWB, and TLGWB. When compared with those with negative postsurgical FDG PET/CT findings, a significant decrease of OS was found in patients with the presence of FDG-avid tumor on the basis of both a log-rank test (P = .001) and a univariate Cox model (hazard ratio = 2.805, P = .001). In patients with FDG-avid tumor, there was a significant association between OS and ln MTVWB (P < .001), ln TLGWB (P < .001), and ln SUVWBmax (P < .010) in either univariate or multivariate analysis, after adjusting for patient age, sex, TNM restage, and therapy after postsurgical PET/CT studies. The OS differences between the groups dichotomized by the median value of MTVWB (11.54 mL, P = .004), TLGWB (32.38 mL, P < .001), or SUVWBmax (4.93, P = .023) were significant. Conclusion MTBWB and tumor maximum standardized uptake at postsurgical FDG PET/CT are related to the patient's OS in NSCLC, independent of age, sex, TNM restaging, and therapy after postsurgical PET/CT studies. \u00a9 RSNA, 2015",
        "To test the hypothesis-given the increasing emphasis on quantitative computed tomographic (CT) phenotypes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-that a relationship exists between COPD exacerbation frequency and quantitative CT measures of emphysema and airway disease.This research protocol was approved by the institutional review board of each participating institution, and all participants provided written informed consent. One thousand two subjects who were enrolled in the COPDGene Study and met the GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) criteria for COPD with quantitative CT analysis were included. Total lung emphysema percentage was measured by using the attenuation mask technique with a -950-HU threshold. An automated program measured the mean wall thickness and mean wall area percentage in six segmental bronchi. The frequency of COPD exacerbation in the prior year was determined by using a questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed to examine the relationship of exacerbation frequency with lung function and quantitative CT measurements.In a multivariate analysis adjusted for lung function, bronchial wall thickness and total lung emphysema percentage were associated with COPD exacerbation frequency. Each 1-mm increase in bronchial wall thickness was associated with a 1.84-fold increase in annual exacerbation rate (P = .004). For patients with 35% or greater total emphysema, each 5% increase in emphysema was associated with a 1.18-fold increase in this rate (P = .047).Greater lung emphysema and airway wall thickness were associated with COPD exacerbations, independent of the severity of airflow obstruction. Quantitative CT can help identify subgroups of patients with COPD who experience exacerbations for targeted research and therapy development for individual phenotypes.",
        "To investigate the use of cine multidetector computed tomography (CT) to detect changes in myocardial function in a swine cardiomyopathy model.All animal protocols were in accordance with the Principles for the Utilization and Care of Vertebrate Animals Used in Testing Research and Training and approved by the University of Missouri Animal Care and Use Committee. Strain analysis of cine multidetector CT images of the left ventricle was optimized and analyzed with feature-tracking software. The standard of reference for strain was harmonic phase analysis of tagged cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) images at 3.0 T. An animal model of cardiomyopathy was imaged with both cardiac MR and 320-section multidetector CT at a temporal resolution of less than 50 msec. Three groups were evaluated: control group (n = 5), aortic-banded myocardial hypertrophy group (n = 5), and aortic-banded and cyclosporine A- treated cardiomyopathy group (n = 5). Histologic samples of the myocardium were obtained for comparison with strain results. Dunnett test was used for comparisons of the concentric remodeling group and eccentric remodeling group against the control group.Collagen volume fraction ranged from 10.9% to 14.2%; lower collagen fraction values were seen in the control group than in the cardiomyopathy groups (P < .05). Ejection fraction and conventional metrics showed no significant differences between control and cardiomyopathy groups. Radial strain for both cardiac MR and multidetector CT was abnormal in both concentric (cardiac MR 25.1% \u00b1 4.2; multidetector CT 28.4% \u00b1 2.8) and eccentric (cardiac MR 23.2% \u00b1 2.0; multidetector CT 24.4% \u00b1 2.1) remodeling groups relative to control group (cardiac MR 18.9% \u00b1 1.9, multidetector CT 22.0% \u00b1 1.7, P < .05, all comparisons). Strain values for multidetector CT versus cardiac MR showed better agreement in the radial direction than in the circumferential direction (r = 0.55, P = .03 vs r = 0.40, P = .13, respectively).Multidetector CT strain analysis has potential to identify regional wall-motion abnormalities in cardiomyopathy that is not otherwise detected using conventional metrics of myocardial function.",
        "Purpose To determine whether whole-body total lesion glycolysis (TLG), which combines volumetric and metabolic information from fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT), can provide a better evaluation of the prognosis for non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Materials and Methods The institutional review board approved this retrospective study, and the requirement to obtain informed consent was waived. The authors identified 105 consecutive patients with NSCLC who underwent staging FDG PET/CT before any therapy. These patients were free of brain metastasis and underwent standard treatment and subsequent clinical follow-up. Metabolic tumor volume (MTV), mean standardized uptake value (SUV), and maximum SUV of each tumor over the whole body were determined. Whole-body MTV and whole-body TLG are the summation of all the MTVs and summation of individual tumor volume multiplied by its mean SUV, respectively. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the prognostic significance of whole-body TLG and other factors, including whole-body MTV, lung TLG, lung MTV, maximum SUV, sex, age, performance status, histologic subtype, T stage, N stage, clinical stage, and treatment method. Results The median follow-up time was 3.1 years. The estimated median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for the cohort was 10.8 months and 2.8 years, respectively. The 1-year PFS was 0.0% for patients with high whole-body TLG (>655) and 50.0% for those with low whole-body TLG (\u2264655). The 1-year OS was 58.8% for patients with high whole-body TLG and 84.1% for those with low whole-body TLG. Univariate analysis showed that whole-body TLG, whole-body MTV, lung TLG, lung MTV, maximum SUV, performance status, T stage, N stage, clinical stage, and treatment type (surgery vs other) were significant prognostic factors for PFS (P < .01 for all). With use of the forward stepwise multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, whole-body TLG (hazard ratio = 2.92; 95% confidence interval: 1.62, 5.26; P < .01) and surgical treatment (hazard ratio = 4.24; 95% confidence interval: 2.54, 7.07; P < .01) remained significant in PFS. Conclusion Whole-body TLG is of prognostic value for NSCLC. It may be a promising tool for stratifying patients with NSCLC for risk-adapted therapies. \u00a9 RSNA, 2012",
        "To test the hypothesis that leukoaraiosis alters functional activation during a semantic decision language task.With institutional review board approval and written informed consent, 18 right-handed, cognitively healthy elderly participants with an aggregate leukoaraiosis lesion volume of more than 25 cm(3) and 18 age-matched control participants with less than 5 cm(3) of leukoaraiosis underwent functional MR imaging to allow comparison of activation during semantic decisions with that during visual perceptual decisions. Brain statistical maps were derived from the general linear model. Spatially normalized group t maps were created from individual contrast images. A cluster extent threshold of 215 voxels was used to correct for multiple comparisons. Intergroup random effects analysis was performed. Language laterality indexes were calculated for each participant.In control participants, semantic decisions activated the bilateral visual cortex, left posteroinferior temporal lobe, left posterior cingulate gyrus, left frontal lobe expressive language regions, and left basal ganglia. Visual perceptual decisions activated the right parietal and posterior temporal lobes. Participants with leukoaraiosis showed reduced activation in all regions associated with semantic decisions; however, activation associated with visual perceptual decisions increased in extent. Intergroup analysis showed significant activation decreases in the left anterior occipital lobe (P=.016), right posterior temporal lobe (P=.048), and right basal ganglia (P=.009) in particpants with leukoariosis. Individual participant laterality indexes showed a strong trend (P=.059) toward greater left lateralization in the leukoaraiosis group.Moderate leukoaraiosis is associated with atypical functional activation during semantic decision tasks. Consequently, leukoaraiosis is an important confounding variable in functional MR imaging studies of elderly individuals.",
        "To formulate radiation precautions for patients with thyroid cancer who are undergoing thyroid hormone withdrawal-induced hypothyroidism and iodine 131 ((131)I) therapy through actual biokinetic measurements.Informed consent and institutional review board approval were obtained. From October 2008 to December 2011, consecutive patients with differentiated thyroid cancer who had been prepared for (131)I ablation treatment or (131)I treatment for metastatic disease during follow-up were prospectively recruited. Calculations based on deduced whole-body retention and measured iodine biokinetics in thyroidal tissue were derived to determine the thyroidal and extrathyroidal compartment uptake fractions and effective half-lives. Precaution times necessary to avoid close contact with family members and the general public were derived from these parameters and regulatory dose limits.Seventy-seven patients (36 with ablation treatments, 41 with follow-up treatments) were eligible for the analysis. Actual dose rates from patients after therapeutic (131)I administration were greatly lower than those described in the American Thyroid Association (ATA) and Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) models: The mean initial dose rate at 0.3 m for patients with ablation treatment was only 28% (0.183/0.655 \u00b5Sv/h/MBq) \u00b1 2.9 (standard deviation) (range, 12.1%-38.3%) and 36% (0.183/0.511 \u00b5Sv/h/MBq) \u00b1 3.7 (range, 15.5%-49.1%) of that described in the NRC and ATA models, respectively; the equivalent values for patients with follow-up treatment were only 30% (0.195/0.655 \u00b5Sv/h/MBq) \u00b1 3.5 (range, 12.5%-45.3%) and 38% (0.195/0.511 \u00b5Sv/h/MBq) \u00b1 4.5 (range, 16.0%-58.1%), respectively. The actual mean effective (131)I half-life in the thyroid remnant tissue was greatly lower than that described in the ATA and NRC models: 47.6 versus 175.2 hours.On the basis of the current dose limits, typically administered activities of 3.7 GBq to a patient with ablation treatment or 7.4 GBq to a patient with follow-up treatment required 3 days of sleeping apart for keeping the doses to pregnant women and children below 1 mSv. No precautions were required for non-cosleeping nonpregnant adult family members.",
        "To compare retrospectively the effects of percutaneous radiofrequency (RF) ablation with those of hepatic resection in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) measuring 2 cm or smaller.This study was approved by the institutional ethics committee, and all patients provided written informed consent before treatment. From December 2003 to December 2008, 145 patients with a resectable HCC measuring 2 cm or smaller were studied. Sixty-six patients had a central HCC (located at least 3 cm from the liver capsule). As an initial treatment, 71 patients were treated with percutaneous RF ablation and 74 with surgical resection. Of the patients with central HCC, 37 underwent percutaneous RF ablation and 29 underwent surgical resection. Survival curves were constructed with the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by using the log-rank test. The relative prognostic significance of the variables for predicting overall survival rates was assessed with multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Complications were observed clinically when patients were admitted and assessed by telephone interview after patients were discharged.One death was considered to be related to treatment after surgical resection. Major complications occurred significantly more often in the surgical resection group (38 of 74 patients) than in the RF ablation group (14 of 71 patients) (P = .009). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 98.5%, 87.7%, and 71.9%, respectively, with RF ablation and 90.5%, 70.9%, and 62.1% with surgical resection (P = .048). The corresponding recurrence-free survival rates were 76.4%, 65.2%, and 59.8% with RF ablation and 75.6%, 56.1%, and 51.3% with surgical resection (P = .548). At subgroup analysis of patients with central HCC, 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 96.6%, 93.0%, and 79.9% with RF ablation and 92.0%, 71.6%, and 61.5% with surgical resection (P = .020). The corresponding recurrence-free survival rates were 86.5%, 74.0%, and 67.0% with RF ablation and 68.0%, 40.0%, and 40.0% with surgical resection (P = .033). For patients with peripheral HCC, 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 97.3%, 83.3%, and 65.1% with RF ablation and 87.8%, 68.4%, and 62.9% with surgical resection (P = .464). The corresponding recurrence-free survival rates were 68.7%, 59.2%, and 54.9% with RF ablation and 82.9%, 66.6%, and 52.9% with surgical resection (P = .351).The efficacy and safety of percutaneous RF ablation were better than those of surgical resection in patients with HCC measuring 2 cm or smaller, especially those with central HCC.",
        "Purpose To compare prostatic arterial embolization (PAE) and transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) in the care of patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Materials and Methods This prospective randomized clinical trial was approved by the institutional review board. A total of 114 patients provided written informed consent and were randomly assigned to undergo PAE (n = 57) or TURP (n = 57). The groups were compared regarding relevant adverse events and complications. Functional results\u2014including improvement of International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), quality of life (QOL), peak urinary flow, postvoiding residual urine volume, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, and prostate volume\u2014were assessed at 1-, 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-month follow-up between January 20, 2007, and January 31, 2012. Student t test, \u03c72 test, Fisher exact test, and repeated measures analysis of variance were used, as appropriate. Results Overall technical success rates for TURP and PAE were 100% and 94.7%, respectively; the clinical failure rates were 3.9% and 9.4%, respectively. The six functional results showed improvements after TURP and PAE at all follow-up time points when compared with preoperative values (P = .001). However, the TURP group showed greater degrees of improvement in the IPSS, QOL, peak urinary flow, and postvoiding residual urine volume at 1 and 3 months, as well as greater reductions in the PSA level and prostate volume at all follow-up time points, when compared with the PAE group (P < .05). The PAE group showed more overall adverse events and complications (P = .029), mostly related to acute urinary retention (25.9%), postembolization syndrome (11.1%), and treatment failures (5.3% technical; 9.4% clinical). Conclusion Both procedures resulted in significant clinical improvements in the treatment of BPH. However, the advantages of the PAE procedure must be weighed against the potential for technical and clinical failures in a minority of patients. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "History A 50-year-old woman presented with a 6-month history of polyarthralgia involving the left and right hands, wrists, elbows, ankles, and knees. Her pain was not associated with morning stiffness but did worsen over the course of the day. She denied experiencing fevers, chills, or mouth ulcers. She did not report paresthesias or blue discoloration of her fingers when they were exposed to cold. Her family history was remarkable for an aunt who died of systemic lupus erythematosus and for a brother with arthritis. Her medical history was remarkable for vitamin D deficiency, hypertension, and rehabilitation for burns. At clinical examination, she had mild tenderness to palpation of her joints, without associated erythema, swelling, or crepitus. Healed skin grafts were also noted. Blood chemistry tests revealed a rheumatoid factor of 8.5 IU/mL (normal range, 0\u201313.9 IU/mL), an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 2 mm/hr (normal range, 0\u201340 mm/hr), and a C-reactive protein value of 0.4 mg/L (3.8 nmol/L) (normal range, 0\u20134.9 mg/L [0\u201346.7 nmol/L]).

        "To investigate the association between radiologist interpretive volume and diagnostic mammography performance in community-based settings.This study received institutional review board approval and was HIPAA compliant. A total of 117,136 diagnostic mammograms that were interpreted by 107 radiologists between 2002 and 2006 in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium were included. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the adjusted effect on sensitivity and the rates of false-positive findings and cancer detection of four volume measures: annual diagnostic volume, screening volume, total volume, and diagnostic focus (percentage of total volume that is diagnostic). Analyses were stratified by the indication for imaging: additional imaging after screening mammography or evaluation of a breast concern or problem.Diagnostic volume was associated with sensitivity; the odds of a true-positive finding rose until a diagnostic volume of 1000 mammograms was reached; thereafter, they either leveled off (P < .001 for additional imaging) or decreased (P = .049 for breast concerns or problems) with further volume increases. Diagnostic focus was associated with false-positive rate; the odds of a false-positive finding increased until a diagnostic focus of 20% was reached and decreased thereafter (P < .024 for additional imaging and P < .001 for breast concerns or problems with no self-reported lump). Neither total volume nor screening volume was consistently associated with diagnostic performance.Interpretive volume and diagnostic performance have complex multifaceted relationships. Our results suggest that diagnostic interpretive volume is a key determinant in the development of thresholds for considering a diagnostic mammogram to be abnormal. Current volume regulations do not distinguish between screening and diagnostic mammography, and doing so would likely be challenging.",
        "To compare magnetic resonance (MR) elastography and ultrasonographic shear-wave elastography ( SWE shear-wave elastography ) for the staging of hepatic fibrosis ( HF hepatic fibrosis ) in the same individuals.This prospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. The technical success of and reliable liver stiffness ( LS liver stiffness ) measurement rates at MR elastography and SWE shear-wave elastography were compared in 129 patients who underwent both examinations. For mutual validation, LS liver stiffness values measured at both examinations were correlated by using Pearson correlation. The diagnostic performance of the two techniques for the assessment of substantial HF hepatic fibrosis (stage \u2265 F2) was compared by using nonparametric receiver operating characteristic analysis.The technical success rates of MR elastography and SWE shear-wave elastography were 95.35% (123 of 129) and 97.67% (126 of 129), respectively (P = .51). MR elastography provided significantly more reliable LS liver stiffness measurements than did SWE shear-wave elastography (95.35% [123 of 129] vs 75.2% [97 of 129], P < .001). The two examinations showed moderate correlation (r = 0.724). In patients with HF hepatic fibrosis stages of F3 or lower, the two examinations showed moderate-to-strong correlation (r = 0.683 in normal livers, 0.754 in livers with stage F0 or F1 HF hepatic fibrosis , and 0.90 in livers with stage F2 or F3 HF hepatic fibrosis ; P < .001); however, they did not show significant correlation for stage F4 HF hepatic fibrosis (r = 0.30, P = .31). MR elastography and SWE shear-wave elastography showed similar diagnostic capability in depicting HF hepatic fibrosis of stage F2 or greater (P = .98) when LS liver stiffness measurements were reliably performed.MR elastography and SWE shear-wave elastography showed moderate correlation and similar diagnostic performance in the diagnosis of HF hepatic fibrosis of stage F2 or greater; however, MR elastography yielded more reliable LS liver stiffness measurements than did SWE shear-wave elastography .",
        "Purpose To propose a new magnetic resonance (MR) classification system based on axial images for cervical compressive myelopathy (CCM) (Ax-CCM system), to assess the interobserver agreement with the Ax-CCM system, and to evaluate the relationship between Ax-CCM patterns and the baseline severity of CCM and the subsequent surgical outcome. Materials and Methods The institutional review board approved this retrospective study. A total of 202 patients (male-to-female ratio, 128:84; mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 56.3 years \u00b1 11.9; age range, 24\u201383 years) with CCM who underwent preoperative MR imaging and decompression surgery were retrospectively evaluated. The Ax-CCM pattern was based on the margin and extent of intramedullary hyperintensity on axial T2-weighted images, as follows; type 0 = normal, type 1 = diffuse, type 2 = fuzzy focal, and type 3 = discrete focal. Interobserver variability was analyzed by using the intraclass correlation coefficient across three readers. The modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score and the postoperative improvement (good vs little improvement) were evaluated according to the Ax-CCM pattern by using one-way analysis of variance, the \u03c72 test, and the Fisher exact test. Results The intraclass correlation coefficient for the Ax-CCM system was 0.83. The preoperative JOA score was significantly different according to Ax-CCM pattern across all readers (P < .05), with the type 2 pattern showing the worst preoperative JOA score (mean, 11.6 \u00b1 3.1 for readers A and C and 11.7 \u00b1 2.9 for reader B). The proportion of good improvement was significantly lower with the type 2 pattern (27 of 72 patients, 37%) than with the other patterns (64 of 123 patients, 52%) (P = .034). Conclusion The Ax-CCM system showed good interobserver agreement, and the type 2 pattern was correlated with poor preoperative neurologic status and less postoperative improvement. \u00a9 RSNA, 2015",
        "Background: The main renal and interlobar arteries flow volume (Q), resistive index (RI), and pulsatility index (PI) are important diagnostic Doppler ultrasonographic parameters used in monitoring progression of renal diseases. There is paucity of literature on the normaladults\u2019 values in our environment. This study determined the normal adult\u2019s main renal andinterlobar arteries RI, PI and Q and evaluated their relationship with age, sex, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean blood pressure (MBP), pulse pressure (PP), pulse rate (PR) and bipolar renal length (BPL). The study also established the correlation of the interlobar with the main renal arteries Doppler parameters and between the right and the left parameters.\r\nMaterial and Methods: This was a cross-sectional prospective study conducted at the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital over five months period on 470 consenting normal adults. The Doppler ultrasound examinations were performed using 1 \u2013 15 MHz curve transducer with colour and power Doppler capabilities. Descriptive statistic was used todetermine the normal values, while student\u2019s t test, ANOVA and Pearson\u2019s correlationcoefficients were used as appropriate for the correlation studies. SPSS for Windows version 16.0 packages (SPSS Inc; IL, USA) was used for the analysis.\r\nResults: The normal adult\u2019s main renal artery Q, RI and PI from the study were 11.20 \u00b11.79cm3/s, 0.72 \u00b1 0.08 and 1.14 \u00b1 0.16 respectively.

        "To investigate the integrity of the default-mode network (DMN) by using independent component analysis (ICA) methods in patients shortly after mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) and healthy control subjects, and to correlate DMN connectivity changes with neurocognitive tests and clinical symptoms.This study was approved by the institutional review board and complied with HIPAA regulations. Twenty-three patients with MTBI who had posttraumatic symptoms shortly after injury (<2 months) and 18 age-matched healthy control subjects were included in this study. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 3 T to characterize the DMN by using ICA methods, including a single-participant ICA on the basis of a comprehensive template from core seeds in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) nodes. ICA z images of DMN components were compared between the two groups and correlated with neurocognitive tests and clinical performance in patients by using Pearson and Spearman rank correlation.When compared with the control subjects, there was significantly reduced connectivity in the PCC and parietal regions and increased frontal connectivity around the MPFC in patients with MTBI (P < .01). These frontoposterior opposing changes within the DMN were significantly correlated (r = -0.44, P = .03). The reduced posterior connectivity correlated positively with neurocognitive dysfunction (eg, cognitive flexibility), while the increased frontal connectivity correlated negatively with posttraumatic symptoms (ie, depression, anxiety, fatigue, and postconcussion syndrome).These results showed abnormal DMN connectivity patterns in patients with MTBI, which may provide insight into how neuronal communication and information integration are disrupted among DMN key structures after mild head injury.",
        "History A 35-year-old man from the upper Midwest region of the United States who had no relevant medical history initially presented to an acute care clinic with multiple small tender skin lesions. His temperature was 38.1\u00b0C, and physical examination revealed several small fluctuant masses that were draining purulent material. Skin culture of one of the draining lesions was performed at this time, but there was no subsequent bacterial growth. A diagnosis of furunculosis was made, and Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim; AR Scientific, Philadelphia, Pa) and a regimen of chlorhexidine washes were prescribed. Two weeks later, the number of skin lesions had increased, and the patient had begun to experience night sweats and fevers. After an episode of hemoptysis and some unusual pain in the patient's right testicle, he presented to the emergency department. At this time, chest radiographs were obtained. The patient was admitted for additional work-up, and computed tomographic (CT) images of the chest were obtained. Physical examination at the time of admission revealed scattered 1-3-cm firm pink hyperpigmented subcutaneous nodules, several of which had overlying pustules. This examination was also notable for a palpable fullness within the right testicle. The patient was afebrile at admission. He denied a history of contact with sick people, illicit drug use, or recent travel. His social history was notable for a 20-pack-year smoking history and a recent relocation to a neighborhood with several new construction sites. Laboratory evaluation revealed leukocytosis (white blood cell count, 15.4 \u00d7 10(9)/L; normal range, [3.5-10.5] \u00d7 10(9)/L), a chemistry panel revealed a low sodium level (132 mEq/L [132 mmol/L]; normal range, 134-142 mEq/L [134-142 mmol/L]), and serum \u03b1-fetoprotein and human chorionic gonadotropin levels were normal. Ultrasonography (US) of the scrotum was performed. Serum analysis was negative for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and type 2 RNA, and Venereal Disease Research Laboratory and rapid plasma regain test results were negative. Blood cultures were negative for bacterial growth. On the basis of chest CT findings, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage was performed. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the abdomen also was performed to further evaluate a focal area of hypoenhancement within the pancreatic tail seen on chest CT images.",
        "Purpose To determine improvement in breast cancer detection by using supplemental three-dimensional (3D) automated breast (AB) ultrasonography (US) with screening mammography versus screening mammography alone in asymptomatic women with dense breasts. Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval and written informed consent were obtained for this HIPAA-compliant study. The SomoInsight Study was an observational, multicenter study conducted between 2009 and 2011. A total of 15 318 women (mean age, 53.3 years \u00b1 10 [standard deviation]; range, 25\u201394 years) presenting for screening mammography alone with heterogeneously (50%\u201375%) or extremely (>75%) dense breasts were included, regardless of further risk characterization, and were followed up for 1 year. Participants underwent screening mammography alone followed by an AB US examination; results were interpreted sequentially. McNemar test was used to assess differences in cancer detection. Results Breast cancer was diagnosed at screening in 112 women: 82 with screening mammography and an additional 30 with AB US. Addition of AB US to screening mammography yielded an additional 1.9 detected cancers per 1000 women screened (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2, 2.7; P < .001). Of cancers detected with screening mammography, 62.2% (51 of 82) were invasive versus 93.3% (28 of 30) of additional cancers detected with AB US (P = .001). Of the 82 cancers detected with either screening mammography alone or the combined read, 17 were detected with screening mammography alone. Of these, 64.7% (11 of 17) were ductal carcinoma in situ versus 6.7% (two of 30) of cancers detected with AB US alone. Sensitivity for the combined read increased by 26.7% (95% CI: 18.3%, 35.1%); the increase in the recall rate per 1000 women screened was 284.9 (95% CI: 278.0, 292.2; P < .001). Conclusion Addition of AB US to screening mammography in a generalizable cohort of women with dense breasts increased the cancer detection yield of clinically important cancers, but it also increased the number of false-positive results. \u00a9 RSNA, 2014",
        "In the past decade, the field of medical image analysis has grown exponentially, with an increased number of pattern recognition tools and an increase in data set sizes. These advances have facilitated the development of processes for high-throughput extraction of quantitative features that result in the conversion of images into mineable data and the subsequent analysis of these data for decision support; this practice is termed radiomics. This is in contrast to the traditional practice of treating medical images as pictures intended solely for visual interpretation. Radiomic data contain first-, second-, and higher-order statistics. These data are combined with other patient data and are mined with sophisticated bioinformatics tools to develop models that may potentially improve diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive accuracy. Because radiomics analyses are intended to be conducted with standard of care images, it is conceivable that conversion of digital images to mineable data will eventually become routine practice. This report describes the process of radiomics, its challenges, and its potential power to facilitate better clinical decision making, particularly in the care of patients with cancer.",
        "Purpose To evaluate whether contrast material\u2013enhanced (CE) fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition (FIESTA) can depict the anterior optic pathways in patients with large suprasellar tumors. Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval was obtained. Twenty-eight patients with large suprasellar tumors undergoing surgical treatment (19 pituitary adenomas, six meningiomas, and three additional miscellaneous tumors) underwent preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, including CE FIESTA, at 3.0 T. Two radiologists assessed the visibility of five segments of the optic pathways (bilateral optic nerves and optic tracts, optic chiasm) with CE FIESTA and conventional MR imaging, including thin-section coronal T2-weighted imaging and CE T1-weighted imaging, by using a three-point scale. Moreover, the preoperative signal intensity of the optic pathways was correlated with pre- and postoperative visual impairment to determine whether high signal intensity at CE FIESTA is predictive of persistence of visual impairment after surgery. The \u03c72 test was used to compare scores assigned to CE FIESTA and conventional MR images. Results The percentage of anterior optic pathways rated as visible was significantly higher with CE FIESTA than with conventional MR imaging (100% [140 of 140 segments] vs 78% [109 of 140 segments], P < .05). Thirty-one of the 140 segments (22%) were not depicted with conventional MR imaging; all of these 31 segments were visualized with CE FIESTA. For 12 patients who underwent transcranial surgery, the anatomic locations of the optic pathways at CE FIESTA were compatible with the surgical findings. CE FIESTA helped predict persistent visual impairment after surgical treatment with a sensitivity of 75% (three of four patients) and a specificity of 96% (23 of 24 patients). The accuracy of CT FIESTA in the prediction of visual loss was significantly higher than that of T2-weighted imaging (93% [26 of 28 patients] vs 50% [14 of 28 patients], P < .05). Conclusion CE FIESTA is useful for the preoperative localization of the anterior optic pathways in patients with large suprasellar tumors and offers the potential to predict persistent visual impairment after decompression. \u00a9 RSNA, 2012 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.12111363/-/DC1",
        "To assess forced-expiratory bronchial collapsibility in healthy volunteers by using multidetector computed tomography (CT) and to compare the results with the current diagnostic criterion for bronchomalacia.The institutional review board approved this HIPAA-compliant study. Following informed consent, 51 healthy volunteers with normal pulmonary function and no history of smoking were imaged by using a 64-detector row scanner with spirometric monitoring at total lung capacity and during forced exhalation. The total study population (in whom both main bronchi were imaged) included 25 men and 26 women (mean age, 50 years). Each scan was analyzed at a workstation by a fellowship-trained thoracic radiologist. Cross-sectional area measurements were obtained from end-inspiratory and forced-expiratory CT images for the right main bronchus (RMB), left main bronchus, (LMB), and bronchus intermedius (BI), and the mean percentage of expiratory collapse was calculated for each bronchus. The number of participants who exceeded the current diagnostic threshold level (>50% expiratory reduction in cross-sectional area) for bronchomalacia was calculated. Comparisons of airway dimensions and airway collapse according to bronchial segment and sex were made by using repeated-measures analysis of variance.Mean percentage of expiratory collapse was 66.9% \u00b1 19.0 (standard deviation) for the RMB and 61.4% \u00b1 16.7 for the LMB. Thirty-seven (73%) of 51 participants exceeded the diagnostic threshold level for bronchomalacia. Significant differences were observed in mean percentage of expiratory collapse between the RMB (66.9% \u00b1 19.0) and LMB (61.4% \u00b1 16.7) (P = .0005). Among a subgroup of 37 participants in whom the BI was also imaged, the mean percentage of expiratory collapse was 61.8% \u00b1 22.8, and 27 (73%) participants exceeded the diagnostic threshold level for bronchomalacia.Healthy volunteers demonstrate a wide range of forced-expiratory bronchial collapse, frequently exceeding the current diagnostic threshold level for bronchomalacia.",
        "To explore white matter (WM) and gray matter tissue integrity in the apparently unaffected hemisphere of patients with herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) who have gross unilateral medial temporal lobe (MTL) lesions and both verbal and visuospatial memory deficits.This study had institutional ethics committee approval and included written informed consent. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed in five patients who had recovered from HSE (one woman, four men; median age, 32 years; interquartile range, 28.5-37 years) and 51 age-matched controls (30 women, 21 men; median age, 32 years; interquartile range, 28-37 years). As markers of microstructural WM integrity, fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity (RD) derived from diffusion-tensor (DT) imaging were used. An automated regional brain segmentation approach yielded estimates of subcortical volumes, including hippocampus, and cortical thickness. Group differences were evaluated by using permutation tests.Examination of standard MR images found unilateral lesions in all patients. The patients with HSE showed reduced FA and increased MD and RD in several WM tracts contralateral to lesions (P < .05, corrected for multiple comparisons). Affected tracts included connections between the MTLs and other parts of the brain. No significant group differences were observed in subcortical volume or cortical thickness.These results suggest that patients with HSE have reduced microstructural integrity of normal-appearing WM contralateral to grossly visible lesions. These subtle lesions, detectable at DT imaging, probably contribute to the memory impairment manifested by these patients.http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.10100179/-/DC1.",
        "To demonstrate the feasibility of using chemical shift magnetic resonance (MR) imaging fat-water separation methods for quantitative estimation of transcatheter lipiodol delivery to liver tissues.Studies were performed in accordance with institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. Proton nuclear MR spectroscopy was first performed to identify lipiodol spectral peaks and relative amplitudes. Next, phantoms were constructed with increasing lipiodol-water volume fractions. A multiecho chemical shift-based fat-water separation method was used to quantify lipiodol concentration within each phantom. Six rats served as controls; 18 rats underwent catheterization with digital subtraction angiography guidance for intraportal infusion of a 15%, 30%, or 50% by volume lipiodol-saline mixture. MR imaging measurements were used to quantify lipiodol delivery to each rat liver. Lipiodol concentration maps were reconstructed by using both single-peak and multipeak chemical shift models. Intraclass and Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated for statistical comparison of MR imaging-based lipiodol concentration and volume measurements to reference standards (known lipiodol phantom compositions and the infused lipiodol dose during rat studies).Both single-peak and multipeak measurements were well correlated to phantom lipiodol concentrations (r(2) > 0.99). Lipiodol volume measurements were progressively and significantly higher when comparing between animals receiving different doses (P < .05 for each comparison). MR imaging-based lipiodol volume measurements strongly correlated with infused dose (intraclass correlation coefficients > 0.93, P < .001) with both single- and multipeak approaches.Chemical shift MR imaging fat-water separation methods can be used for quantitative measurements of lipiodol delivery to liver tissues.",
        "To report the prevalence of qualitative radiographic findings for femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) and associations among them and to characterize the inter- and intraobserver variability of these interpretations.This study is part of an institutional review board-approved population-based prospective follow-up of 2081 of 4006 (participation rate, 51.9%) young adults (874 [42.0%] male participants, 1207 [58.0%] female participants; mean age, 18.6 years) who took part in a randomized hip trial on developmental dysplasia of the hip. All participants gave informed consent. Two pelvic radiographs were obtained. Pistol-grip deformity, focal femoral neck prominence, and flattening of the lateral head, all suggestive of cam-type impingement, and the posterior wall sign, excessive acetabular coverage, and crossover sign, all suggestive of pincer-type impingement, were assessed subjectively by an experienced radiologist. To assess inter- and intraobserver agreement, images from 350 examinations were read independently twice by two observers.Cam-type deformities were seen in 868 male and 1192 female participants, respectively, as follows: pistol-grip deformity, 187 (21.5%) and 39 (3.3%); focal femoral neck prominence, 89 (10.3%) and 31 (2.6%); and flattening of the lateral femoral head, 125 (14.4%) and 74 (6.2%). Pincer-type deformities were seen in the same numbers of male and female participants, respectively, as follows: posterior wall sign, 203 (23.4%) and 131 (11.0%); and excessive acetabular coverage, 127 (14.6%) and 58 (4.9%) (all P < .001, according to sex distribution). The crossover sign was seen in 446 (51.4%) and 542 (45.5%) of the male and female participants, respectively (P = .004). There was a high degree of coexistence (odds ratio [OR] > 2) among most FAI findings. Interobserver agreement was good to very good (\u03ba = 0.74-0.84) in rating cam- and pincer-type findings. Intraobserver agreement was moderate or good (\u03ba = 0.49-0.80) for all findings for both observers.Overall, radiographic FAI findings are quite common in a population of healthy young adults, especially in males, with a high degree of coexistence among most findings (OR > 2).",
        "To evaluate the incremental value of diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping in relation to conventional breast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the characterization of benign versus malignant breast lesions at 3.0 T.This retrospective HIPAA-compliant study was approved by the institutional review board, with the requirement for informed patient consent waived. Of 550 consecutive patients who underwent bilateral breast MR imaging over a 10-month period, 93 women with 101 lesions met the following study inclusion criteria: They had undergone three-dimensional (3D) high-spatial-resolution T1-weighted contrast material-enhanced MR imaging, dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging, and DW imaging examinations at 3.0 T and either had received a pathologic analysis-proven diagnosis (96 lesions) or had lesion stability confirmed at more than 2 years of follow-up (five lesions). DW images were acquired with b values of 0 and 600 sec/mm(2). Regions of interest were drawn on ADC maps of breast lesions and normal glandular tissue. Morphologic features (margin, enhancement pattern), dynamic contrast-enhanced MR results (semiquantitative kinetic curve data), absolute ADCs, and glandular tissue-normalized ADCs were included in multivariate models to predict a diagnosis of benign versus malignant lesion.Forty-one (44%) of the 93 patients were premenopausal, and 52 (56%) were postmenopausal. Thirty-three (32.7%) of the 101 lesions were benign, and 68 (67.3%) were malignant. Normalized ADCs were significantly different between the benign (mean ADC, 1.1 x 10(-3) mm(2)/sec +/- 0.4 [standard deviation]) and malignant (mean ADC, 0.55 x 10(-3) mm(2)/sec +/- 0.16) lesions (P < .001). Adding normalized ADCs to the 3D T1-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced MR data improved the diagnostic performance of MR imaging: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve improved from 0.89 to 0.98, and the false-positive rate decreased from 36% (nine of 25 lesions) to 24% (six of 25 lesions).DW imaging with glandular tissue-normalized ADC assessment improves the characterization of breast lesions beyond the characterization achieved with conventional 3D T1-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging at 3.0 T.",
        "Purpose To retrospectively evaluate the utility of gadoxetic acid\u2013enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the differential diagnosis of hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) and focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH). Materials and Methods This study had institutional review board approval; the requirement for informed consent was waived. Eighty-two patients (58 patients with FNH and 24 patients with HCAs) with 111 lesions were included in the study. There were 74 female patients and eight male patients (mean age, 41.9 years \u00b1 13.2 [standard deviation]; age range, 11\u201378 years). Two readers reviewed all images in terms of signal intensity (SI) features on unenhanced, dynamic, and hepatobiliary phase images. For quantitative analysis, contrast enhancement ratio (CER), lesion-to-liver contrast (LLC), and SI ratio on dynamic and hepatobiliary phase images were calculated. Results The CER of FNH in the arterial phase (mean, 94.3% \u00b1 33.2) was significantly higher than that of HCAs (mean, 59.3% \u00b1 28.1) (P < .0001). During the hepatobiliary phase, the LLC of FNH showed minimally positive values (mean, 0.05 \u00b1 0.01) and that of HCAs demonstrated strong negative values (mean, \u22120.67 \u00b1 0.24) (P < .0001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the hepatobiliary phase SI ratio for differentiation of the two tumors was 0.97, and a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 91% were found with a cutoff value of 0.87. Among six FNH lesions that showed atypical hypointensity during the hepatobiliary phase, four had a large central scar, one contained a substantial fat component, and one had abundant radiating fibrous septa. Three HCAs were isointense during the hepatobiliary phase owing to severe hepatic steatosis. Conclusion Gadoxetic acid\u2013enhanced MR imaging facilitates the differentiation of FNH from HCA. \u00a9 RSNA, 2012 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.11101742/-/DC1",
        "To verify the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 in stent-induced hyperplastic tissue from patients with colorectal cancer who received colorectal stents as a bridge to surgery.This prospective study was institutional review board-approved, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Eleven patients (nine men, two women; mean age, 67 years; age range, 53-82 years) with malignant colorectal obstructions who received a colorectal stent between May and December 2010 were included. Tissue specimens were analyzed for MMP-9 and MMP-2 expression. After resection, the tissue was segmented into three parts: tumor tissue, stent-induced tissue hyperplasia, and normal colon tissue. MMP-9 and MMP-2 expression were determined by using zymography, Western blot analysis, and real-time reverse-transcription (qRT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Significance of differences between groups was evaluated with Friedman analysis of variance test. Signed-rank test was used to determine differences between malignant tumor tissue and stent-induced hyperplastic tissue groups.Stent placement was technically successful in all 11 patients. Stent-induced hyperplastic tissues were found in all patients. Zymography (P = .003) and Western blot analysis (P = .008) showed that expression of MMP-9 was higher in malignant tumor tissue and stent-induced hyperplastic tissue groups compared with normal colorectal tissue group, demonstrating significant differences between groups but no significant differences between malignant tumor and stent-induced hyperplastic tissues. As for results of qRT PCR analysis, the stent-induced hyperplastic tissue group showed increases in messenger RNA expression level of MMP-9 compared with the malignant tumor tissue group (50.42-fold \u00b1 66.30 higher).High expression of MMP-9 is closely associated with stent-induced colorectal tissue hyperplasia in patients with colorectal cancer.",
        "To compare magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings and clinical assessment for prediction of pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in patients with stage II or III breast cancer.The HIPAA-compliant protocol and the informed consent process were approved by the American College of Radiology Institutional Review Board and local-site institutional review boards. Women with invasive breast cancer of 3 cm or greater undergoing NACT with an anthracycline-based regimen, with or without a taxane, were enrolled between May 2002 and March 2006. MR imaging was performed before NACT (first examination), after one cycle of anthracyline-based treatment (second examination), between the anthracycline-based regimen and taxane (third examination), and after all chemotherapy and prior to surgery (fourth examination). MR imaging assessment included measurements of tumor longest diameter and volume and peak signal enhancement ratio. Clinical size was also recorded at each time point. Change in clinical and MR imaging predictor variables were compared for the ability to predict pathologic complete response (pCR) and residual cancer burden (RCB). Univariate and multivariate random-effects logistic regression models were used to characterize the ability of tumor response measurements to predict pathologic outcome, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) used as a summary statistic.Data in 216 women (age range, 26-68 years) with two or more imaging time points were analyzed. For prediction of both pCR and RCB, MR imaging size measurements were superior to clinical examination at all time points, with tumor volume change showing the greatest relative benefit at the second MR imaging examination. AUC differences between MR imaging volume and clinical size predictors at the early, mid-, and posttreatment time points, respectively, were 0.14, 0.09, and 0.02 for prediction of pCR and 0.09, 0.07, and 0.05 for prediction of RCB. In multivariate analysis, the AUC for predicting pCR at the second imaging examination increased from 0.70 for volume alone to 0.73 when all four predictor variables were used. Additional predictive value was gained with adjustments for age and race.MR imaging findings are a stronger predictor of pathologic response to NACT than clinical assessment, with the greatest advantage observed with the use of volumetric measurement of tumor response early in treatment.",
        "Purpose To determine the type and frequency of errors during vascular interventional radiology (VIR) and design and implement an intervention to reduce error and improve efficiency in this setting. Materials and Methods Ethical guidance was sought from the Research Services Department at Imperial College London. Informed consent was not obtained. Field notes were recorded during 55 VIR procedures by a single observer. Two blinded assessors identified failures from field notes and categorized them into one or more errors by using a 22-part classification system. The potential to cause harm, disruption to procedural flow, and preventability of each failure was determined. A preprocedural team rehearsal (PPTR) was then designed and implemented to target frequent preventable potential failures. Thirty-three procedures were observed subsequently to determine the efficacy of the PPTR. Nonparametric statistical analysis was used to determine the effect of intervention on potential failure rates, potential to cause harm and procedural flow disruption scores (Mann-Whitney U test), and number of preventable failures (Fisher exact test). Results Before intervention, 1197 potential failures were recorded, of which 54.6% were preventable. A total of 2040 errors were deemed to have occurred to produce these failures. Planning error (19.7%), staff absence (16.2%), equipment unavailability (12.2%), communication error (11.2%), and lack of safety consciousness (6.1%) were the most frequent errors, accounting for 65.4% of the total. After intervention, 352 potential failures were recorded. Classification resulted in 477 errors. Preventable failures decreased from 54.6% to 27.3% (P < .001) with implementation of PPTR. Potential failure rates per hour decreased from 18.8 to 9.2 (P < .001), with no increase in potential to cause harm or procedural flow disruption per failure. Conclusion Failures during VIR procedures are largely because of ineffective planning, communication error, and equipment difficulties, rather than a result of technical or patient-related issues. Many of these potential failures are preventable. A PPTR is an effective means of targeting frequent preventable failures, reducing procedural delays and improving patient safety. \u00a9 RSNA, 2012",
        "To determine the feasibility of using in vivo diffusion-tensor imaging and tractography of the physis to examine changes related to rate of growth, location, and age.This retrospective study was institutional review board approved and HIPAA compliant and the requirement for informed consent was waived. Diffusion-tensor imaging of the knee was performed at 3.0 T in 31 subjects (nine boys and 22 girls) with a median age of 13.6 years. The mean ages of boys and girls were 14.7 years (range, 12.0-18.3 years) and 13.2 years (range, 7.0-18.6 years), respectively. Regions of interest were placed in the physis of the tibia and femur, and in the epiphyseal and articular cartilage of these bones. Tractography was performed by using a fractional anisotropic threshold of 0.15 and an angle threshold of 40\u00b0. The tractographic patterns were qualitatively evaluated and changes related to age were described. The tract-based apparent diffusion coefficient, fractional anistropy, tensor eigenvalues, and tract length were measured. Diffusion parameters were compared between the center and periphery of the physis, and between the distal femur and proximal tibia.Tractography resulted in parallel tracts in the physis and the adjacent metaphysis. Tractographic pattern changed with age, with individuals approaching physeal closure having shorter tracts in a random arrangement. Patterns of tractography varied with age in the femur (P < .001) and tibia (P < .001). Femoral tracts (median length, 6.5 mm) were longer than tibial tracts (median length, 4.3 mm) (P < .001). Tracts in the periphery of the physes were longer than those in the center (femur, P = .005; tibia, P = .004). In the physis of the femur and tibia, a significant age-related decrease was observed in apparent diffusion coefficient (P < .001 for both), axial diffusion (femur, P = .001; tibia, P < .001), and transverse diffusion [P < .001 for both]), and an age-related increase was seen in fractional anistropy (P < .001, for both).Diffusion-tensor imaging shows the columnar microstructure of the physis and adjacent metaphysis, and provides further insight into normal growth.",
        "Purpose To prospectively evaluate dose reduction and image quality characteristics of abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scans reconstructed with model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) compared with adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) in oncology patients with colorectal liver metastases. Materials and Methods The study complied with HIPAA guidelines and was approved by the ethics committee of the institutional review board. All patients gave written informed consent. Fifty-one patients with colorectal liver metastases underwent body CT (thorax and abdomen) with a 64-section multidetector unit. With a radiation dose reduction by 2.36 mGy compared to standard of care CT with ASIR 50% (radiation dose, 7.54 mGy), MBIR can provide diagnostically acceptable CT scans without compromising image quality. Two radiologists independently assessed randomized images in a blinded manner. Imaging sets were compared for lesion detection, lesion conspicuity, overall image quality, and signal-to-noise ratio with a paired sample t test. Inter- and intraobserver agreement was assessed with the Cohen \u03ba. Results The mean volume CT dose index was 5.18 mGy \u00b1 0.76, mean dose-length product 374 mGy \u00b7 cm \u00b1 63.47, mean effective diameter 29.38 cm \u00b1 3.46, and mean size-specific dose estimate 6.52 mGy \u00b1 0.73. In small liver lesions (<10 mm), detection and conspicuity were significantly higher with MBIR than with ASIR for both right (t = 3.245, P = .004 and t = 2.696, P = .013, respectively) and left (t = 2.390, P = .038 and t = 2.283, P = .046) liver lobes. Subjective image noise (t = 4.506, P < .001), artifacts (t = 3.479, P = .001), and diagnostic confidence (t = 2.643, P = .011) were significantly better with MBIR than with ASIR. Conclusion MBIR performed better than ASIR 50% at providing diagnostically acceptable CT scans without compromising image quality and in the detection of colorectal liver metastases. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "To determine the causal association and effect of intravenous iodinated contrast material exposure on the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI), also known as contrast material-induced nephropathy (CIN).This retrospective study was approved by an institutional review board and was HIPAA compliant. Informed consent was waived. All contrast material-enhanced (contrast group) and unenhanced (noncontrast group) abdominal, pelvic, and thoracic CT scans from 2000 to 2010 were identified at a single facility. Scan recipients were sorted into low- (<1.5 mg/dL), medium- (1.5-2.0 mg/dL), and high-risk (>2.0 mg/dL) subgroups of presumed risk for CIN by using baseline serum creatinine (SCr) level. The incidence of AKI (SCr \u2265 0.5 mg/dL above baseline) was compared between contrast and noncontrast groups after propensity score adjustment by stratification, 1:1 matching, inverse weighting, and weighting by the odds methods to reduce intergroup selection bias. Counterfactual analysis was used to evaluate the causal relation between contrast material exposure and AKI by evaluating patients who underwent contrast-enhanced and unenhanced CT scans during the study period with the McNemar test.A total of 157,140 scans among 53,439 unique patients associated with 1,510,001 SCr values were identified. AKI risk was not significantly different between contrast and noncontrast groups in any risk subgroup after propensity score adjustment by using reported risk factors of CIN (low risk: odds ratio [OR], 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.76, 1.13; P = .47; medium risk: odds ratio, 0.97; 95% CI: 0.81, 1.16; P = .76; high risk: OR, 0.91; 95% CI: 0.66, 1.24; P = .58). Counterfactual analysis revealed no significant difference in AKI incidence between enhanced and unenhanced CT scans in the same patient (McNemar test: \u03c7(2) = 0.63, P = .43) (OR = 0.92; 95% CI: 0.75, 1.13; P = .46).Following adjustment for presumed risk factors, the incidence of CIN was not significantly different from contrast material-independent AKI. These two phenomena were clinically indistinguishable with established SCr-defined criteria, suggesting that intravenous iodinated contrast media may not be the causative agent in diminished renal function after contrast material administration.http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.12121823/-/DC1.",
        "Purpose To determine the relationship between tumor heterogeneity assessed by means of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging texture analysis and survival outcomes in patients with primary breast cancer. Materials and Methods Between January and August 2010, texture analysis of the entire primary breast tumor in 203 patients was performed with T2-weighted and contrast material\u2013enhanced T1-weighted subtraction MR imaging for preoperative staging. Histogram-based uniformity and entropy were calculated. To dichotomize texture parameters for survival analysis, the 10-fold cross-validation method was used to determine cutoff points in the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to determine the association of texture parameters and morphologic or volumetric information obtained at MR imaging or clinical-pathologic variables with recurrence-free survival (RFS). Results There were 26 events, including 22 recurrences (10 local-regional and 12 distant) and four deaths, with a mean follow-up time of 56.2 months. In multivariate analysis, a higher N stage (RFS hazard ratio, 11.15 [N3 stage]; P = .002, Bonferroni-adjusted \u03b1 = .0167), triple-negative subtype (RFS hazard ratio, 16.91; P < .001, Bonferroni-adjusted \u03b1 = .0167), high risk of T1 entropy (less than the cutoff values [mean, 5.057; range, 5.022\u20135.167], RFS hazard ratio, 4.55; P = .018), and T2 entropy (equal to or higher than the cutoff values [mean, 6.013; range, 6.004\u20136.035], RFS hazard ratio = 9.84; P = .001) were associated with worse outcomes. Conclusion Patients with breast cancers that appeared more heterogeneous on T2-weighted images (higher entropy) and those that appeared less heterogeneous on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted subtraction images (lower entropy) exhibited poorer RFS. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Introduction: Worldwide, breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed life threatening cancer in women and the leading cause of cancer death in women. Late presentation is still a dilemma in developing countries. Identifying the modifiable socio-demographic factors associated with breast cancer is important\r\nin reducing the incidence.Aim: To determine the socio-demographic correlates and management of Breast Cancer in Department of Radiotherapy, Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH) between January 2004 and December 2013.Method: Data was retrieved from breast cancer patients\u2019 case notes and analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS)Results: A total of 1,141 cases were analysed with a mean age was 46.84\u00b112.36 years which ranged between 17 and 84 years and modal age group was 40 \u2013 49 years. There were 1132(99.2%) female and 9(0.8%) male, 920(81.3%) were premenopausal while 212(18.7%) were post-menopausal. The mean number of children born was 3.75\u00b11.76 and age at first pregnancy revealed a mean of 24.26\u00b14.73 years. Out of the 1141 patients analysed, 514(45.0%) of female patients were found to have breastfed their children for a mean duration of 13.75\u00b15.66 months which ranged between 6 - 24months. Highest incidence of breast cancer was recorded as 164(14.37%) in year 2010. Invasive ductal carcinoma 956(82.8%) was the commonest histological type seen. Only\r\n998(87.5%) of cases had stage of disease recorded in which the commonest9\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstage at presentation was stage IV 425(42.6%). A total of 139(12.18%) had Immunohistochemistry recorded, molecular subtype seen mostly was Lumina A. 135(63.2%) had biopsied lymph nodes were positive for malignancy out of 214(18.8%) casesrecorded.153(13.4%)hadapositivefamilyhistoryofbreast cancers, 125(11.1%) had history of oral contraceptive use. 28.55\u00b16.39kg/m2., 387(33.9%) were of normal weight, while 258(22.6%) and 202(17.7%) were obese and morbid obese respectively. The commonest comorbidity out of the 176 patients recorded was found to be hypertension 136(77.3%). Treatment combination surgery-chemotherapy-radiotherapy 213(30.9%) was the commonest form of management given with mastectomy 289(59.4%) as the major form of surgery received, FEC chemotherapy regimen was mostly administered 216(40.6%) and radiotherapy intention mostly given was radical 294(71.6%). 48.1% of the patients were lost to follow-up. In addition, 447(39.3%) were dead, while 145(12.7%) were on follow-up treatment. Out of these patients on follow-up, 42.2% had complete response while 24.1% had disease progression.\r\nConclusion and Recommendation: There is need to encourage early detection, through screening, advocacy and health education (breast self-examination BSE).

        "To systematically investigate structural and functional alterations of the thalamus and its subregions through a multimodal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging technique and examine its clinical relevance in multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica (NMO).The institutional review board approved this study, and written informed consent was obtained from each participant. Thirty-seven patients with MS, 39 patients with NMO, and 40 healthy control subjects were recruited. Six MR imaging measurements were obtained for each participant and compared between groups in the thalamus and its seven subregions, including gray matter (GM) volume, fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation, cross-correlation coefficient of spontaneous low frequency, and weighted functional connectivity strength. Partial correlation was used to estimate the MR imaging-clinical relationships.Both MS and NMO exhibited widespread GM atrophy (GM volume in MS, 0.244; NMO, 0.297; and control subjects, 0.329; P < .001) and diffusion abnormalities (fractional anisotropy in MS, 0.293; NMO, 0.323; and control subjects, 0.355; P < .001) in the whole thalamus and several subregions, while MS showed more severe changes than NMO. Decreased cross-correlation coefficient of spontaneous low-frequency and weighted functional connectivity strength was observed in several thalamus subregions in MS (P < .05), but no significant functional abnormalities were identified in NMO. GM volume, fractional anisotropy, and mean diffusivity, not functional changes of the thalamus and thalamic subregions, correlated with the patients' clinical variables and exhibited high discriminative power in distinguishing the three groups.Similar patterns of thalamic structural alteration were identified in MS and NMO, but MS showed more severe pathologic changes. The thalamus is a key node for functional disconnection in MS but not in NMO.",
        "Purpose To define thresholds for detecting significant change in liver viscoelasticity with magnetic resonance (MR) elastography, both for whole-liver measurements and for voxel-wise measurements in relation to spatial resolution. Materials and Methods This prospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and all participants provided written informed consent. Thirty participants (16 volunteers and 14 patients with hepatitis B or C; 18 men; median age, 30.4 years; age range, 18.9\u201358.6 years) underwent imaging twice while in the same position (intraimage reproducibility), after repositioning (within-day reproducibility), and 1\u20134 weeks later (between-weeks reproducibility). MR elastography parameters comprised elasticity, viscosity, attenuation parameter \u03b1, and propagation parameter \u03b2. Bland-Altman analysis was used to calculate repeatability indexes for each parameter. Analyses were performed in a region-of-interest and a voxel-by-voxel level. Voxel-wise results were calculated in relation to spatial resolution by applying Gaussian filtering to establish the optimal trade-off point between resolution and reproducibility. Results For elasticity, \u03b1, and \u03b2, within-day and between-weeks results were significantly lower than intraimage results (P \u2264 .018 for all). Within-day and between-weeks results did not differ significantly. Over-time changes of more than 22.2% for elasticity, 26.3% for viscosity, 26.8% for \u03b1, and 10.1% for \u03b2 represented thresholds for significant change. The optimal trade-off between spatial resolution and reproducibility was found at a filter size of 8-mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) for elasticity and propagation parameter \u03b2 and at 16-mm FWHM for viscosity and attenuation parameter \u03b1. Conclusion Repositioning causes a significant decrease in the reproducibility of MR elastography. The propagation parameter \u03b2 is the most reliable parameter, with an over-time threshold for significant change of 10.1% and the ability to reproduce viscoelasticity up to a resolution of 8-mm FWHM. \u00a9RSNA, 2013 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To prospectively evaluate apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) histograms in the prediction of chemotherapy response in patients with metastatic ovarian or primary peritoneal cancer.Research ethics committee approval and patient written informed consent were obtained. Diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed through the abdomen and pelvis before and after one and three cycles of chemotherapy in 42 women (mean age, 63.0 years \u00b1 11.4 [standard deviation]) with newly diagnosed or recurrent disease. Reproducibility and intra- and interobserver agreement of ADC calculations were assessed. Per-patient weighted ADC histograms were generated at each time point from pixel ADCs from five or fewer target lesions. Mean ADC, percentiles (10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th), skew, kurtosis, and their change were analyzed according to histologic grade, primary versus recurrent disease status, and response, determined with integrated biochemical and morphologic criteria, with a linear mixed model. Areas under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) for combinations of parameters were calculated with linear discriminant analysis.Coefficients of variation for repeat measurements and for within and between observers were 4.8%, 11.4%, and 13.7%, respectively. Grade and disease status did not significantly affect histogram parameters. Pretreatment ADCs were not predictive of response. In responders, all ADCs increased after the first and third cycle (P < .001), while skew and kurtosis decreased after the third (P < .001 and P = .006, respectively); however, in nonresponders, no parameter changed significantly. Percentage change of the 25th percentile performed best in identifying response (AUC = 0.82 and 0.83 after first and third cycle, respectively), whereas combination of parameters did not improve accuracy.An early increase of ADCs and later decrease of skew and kurtosis characterize chemotherapy response. Quantitative DW MR imaging can aid in early monitoring of treatment efficacy in patients with advanced ovarian cancer.",
        "To determine radiation dose indexes for computed tomography (CT) performed with renal colic protocols in the United States, including frequency of reduced-dose technique usage and any institutional-level factors associated with high or low dose indexes.The Dose Imaging Registry (DIR) collects deidentified CT data, including examination type and dose indexes, for CT performed at participating institutions; thus, the DIR portion of the study was exempt from institutional review board approval and was HIPAA compliant. CT dose indexes were examined at the institutional level for CT performed with a renal colic protocol at institutions that contributed at least 10 studies to the registry as of January 2013. Additionally, patients undergoing CT for renal colic at a single institution (with institutional review board approval and informed consent from prospective subjects and waiver of consent from retrospective subjects) were studied to examine individual renal colic CT dose index patterns and explore relationships between patient habitus, demographics, and dose indexes. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze dose indexes, and linear regression and Spearman correlations were used to examine relationships between dose indexes and institutional factors.There were 49 903 renal colic protocol CT examinations conducted at 93 institutions between May 2011 and January 2013. Mean age \u00b1 standard deviation was 49 years \u00b1 18, and 53.9% of patients were female. Institutions contributed a median of 268 (interquartile range, 77-699) CT studies. Overall mean institutional dose-length product (DLP) was 746 mGy \u22c5 cm (effective dose, 11.2 mSv), with a range of 307-1497 mGy \u22c5 cm (effective dose, 4.6-22.5 mSv) for mean DLPs. Only 2% of studies were conducted with a DLP of 200 mGy \u22c5 cm or lower (a \"reduced dose\") (effective dose, 3 mSv), and only 10% of institutions kept DLP at 400 mGy \u22c5 cm (effective dose, 6 mSv) or less in at least 50% of patients.Reduced-dose renal protocol CT is used infrequently in the United States. Mean dose index is higher than reported previously, and institutional variation is substantial.",
        "To compare magnetic resonance (MR) quantitative equilibrium signal (qS0) mapping with quantitative computed tomography (CT) in the estimation of emphysema in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).Written informed consent of the original study permitted future reanalysis of data. This study was a retrospective analysis of data from an institutional review board-approved study. Twenty-four patients with COPD and 12 healthy patients who did not smoke underwent spirometry and two separate 1.5-T MR imaging examinations. All patients with COPD underwent additional chest CT. Lung MR qS0 maps were generated from MR images obtained with multiple inversion times by fitting the inversion recovery signal equation. Mean, 15th percentile, and standard deviation of whole-lung qS0 and relative lung area with a qS0 value below 0.20 (RA0.20) were measured and compared between groups with an unpaired t test. Reproducibility between two examinations was tested with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), and their associations with spirometry and CT measurements of 15th percentile attenuation (PA15) and relative lung area with attenuation below -950 HU (RA-950) were assessed with the Pearson correlation coefficient.Whole-lung mean qS0 and 15th percentile of qS0 were significantly lower, whereas RA0.20 and standard deviation of qS0 were significantly higher in patients with COPD than in healthy control subjects (P = .014, P = .002, P = .005, and P < .001, respectively). Whole-lung mean qS0, the 15th percentile of qS0, and RA0.20 strongly correlated with RA-950 (r = -0.78, r = -0.81, and r = 0.86, respectively; P < .001) and PA15 (r = 0.78, r = 0.79, and r = -0.71, respectively; P < .001) and moderately correlated with the ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) to forced vital capacity (r = 0.63, r = 0.67, and r = -0.60, respectively; P < .001) and percentage predicted FEV1 (r = 0.54, r = 0.62, and r = -0.56, respectively; P \u2264 .001). Good reproducibility of qS0 readouts was found in both groups (ICC range, 0.89-0.98).Lung MR qS0 mapping may be a reliable noncontrast nonradiation alternative to CT in the assessment of emphysema in patients with COPD.",
        "Background: The prevalence of male infertility in our environment is largely unknown while in the western world, it is estimated to be about 30% with male factor responsible for close to 50% of cases. Apart from seminal fluid analysis, there is no universal consensus on the mode of evaluation of men with infertility. This is a prospective study that evaluated the role of scrotal ultrasonography in men with infertility.Methodology: The study examined 220 subjects over a period of one year. The subjects comprised of one hundred and thirty-six patients with diagnosis of male infertility, as well as 84 healthy individuals as control. The relevant clinical history of each patient was extracted from their case notes.All the subjects had their testes examined using a high frequency 7.5mHz linear transducer of an Aloka (Prosound SDD-3500 Plus, Japan 2005) ultrasound scanner.The results were expressed as percentages and tests of significance were done using the chi-square and student t-test. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Results: The mean age for infertile patients was 36.80+0.98 years while the peak age for both groups, was 30-39years.2There was a statistically significant difference between the testicular volumes in fertile and infertile men, while there was an inverse relationship between testicular volume and severity of oligospermia.The overall proportion of scrotal abnormalities was 93% in infertile men versus 26% in control group. Varicocele was the most common abnormal finding occurring in 63.2% and 11.9% of infertile and normal patients respectively. There was a 2.9% and 0% incidence of suspected early stage testicular tumor in the infertile and control groups respectively.Conclusion: Scrotal ultrasonography was able to detect potentially curable causes of infertility in more than half of the infertile men and was able to detect testicular tumors at a potentially curable stage. Scrotal ultrasonography is recommended as a valuable tool for the evaluation of men with infertility.",
        "Purpose To develop a silicon (Si) and cadmium telluride (CdTe) imaging Compton camera for biomedical application on the basis of technologies used for astrophysical observation and to test its capacity to perform three-dimensional (3D) imaging. Materials and Methods All animal experiments were performed according to the Animal Care and Experimentation Committee (Gunma University, Maebashi, Japan). Flourine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), iodine 131 (131I) methylnorcholestenol, and gallium 67 (67Ga) citrate, separately compacted into micro tubes, were inserted subcutaneously into a Wistar rat, and the distribution of the radioisotope compounds was determined with 3D imaging by using the Compton camera after the rat was sacrificed (ex vivo model). In a separate experiment, indium 111(111In) chloride and 131I-methylnorcholestenol were injected into a rat intravenously, and copper 64 (64Cu) chloride was administered into the stomach orally just before imaging. The isotope distributions were determined with 3D imaging after sacrifice by means of the list-mode-expectation-maximizing-maximum-likelihood method. Results The Si/CdTe Compton camera demonstrated its 3D multinuclear imaging capability by separating out the distributions of FDG, 131I-methylnorcholestenol, and 67Ga-citrate clearly in a test-tube\u2013implanted ex vivo model. In the more physiologic model with tail vein injection prior to sacrifice, the distributions of 131I-methylnorcholestenol and 64Cu-chloride were demonstrated with 3D imaging, and the difference in distribution of the two isotopes was successfully imaged although the accumulation on the image of 111In-chloride was difficult to visualize because of blurring at the low-energy region. Conclusion The Si/CdTe Compton camera clearly resolved the distribution of multiple isotopes in 3D imaging and simultaneously in the ex vivo model. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "Purpose To use time-resolved three-dimensional phase-contrast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, also called four-dimensional flow MR imaging, to evaluate systolic blood flow patterns in the ascending aorta that may predispose patients with a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) to aneurysm. Materials and Methods The HIPAA-compliant protocol received institutional review board approval, and informed consent was obtained. Four-dimensional flow MR imaging was used to assess blood flow in the thoracic aorta of 53 individuals: 20 patients with a BAV, 25 patients with a tricuspid aortic valve (TAV), and eight healthy volunteers. The Fisher exact test was used to evaluate the significance of flow pattern differences. Results Nested helical flow was seen at peak systole in the ascending aorta of 15 of 20 patients with a BAV but in none of the healthy volunteers or patients with a TAV. This flow pattern was seen both in patients with a BAV with a dilated ascending aorta (n = 6) and in those with a normal ascending aorta (n = 9), was seen in the absence of aortic stenosis (n = 5), and was associated with eccentric systolic flow jets in all cases. Fusion of right and left leaflets gave rise to right-handed helical flow and right-anterior flow jets (n = 11), whereas right and noncoronary fusion gave rise to left-handed helical flow with left-posterior flow jets (n = 4). Conclusion Four-dimensional flow MR imaging showed abnormal helical systolic flow in the ascending aorta of patients with a BAV, including those without aneurysm or aortic stenosis. Identification and characterization of eccentric flow jets in these patients may help identify those at risk for development of ascending aortic aneurysm. \u00a9 RSNA, 2010",
        "Purpose To retrospectively determine the relationship between apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) obtained with 3.0-T diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and Gleason grades in peripheral zone prostate cancer. Materials and Methods The requirement to obtain institutional review board approval was waived. Fifty-one patients with prostate cancer underwent MR imaging before prostatectomy, including DW MR imaging with b values of 0, 50, 500, and 800 sec/mm2. In prostatectomy specimens, separate slice-by-slice determinations of Gleason grade groups were performed according to primary, secondary, and tertiary Gleason grades. In addition, tumors were classified into qualitative grade groups (low-, intermediate-, or high-grade tumors). ADC maps were aligned to step-sections and regions of interest annotated for each tumor slice. The median ADC of tumors was related to qualitative grade groups with linear mixed-model regression analysis. The accuracy of the median ADC in the most aggressive tumor component in the differentiation of low- from combined intermediate- and high-grade tumors was summarized by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (Az). Results In 51 prostatectomy specimens, 62 different tumors and 251 step-section tumor lesions were identified. The median ADC in the tumors showed a negative relationship with Gleason grade group, and differences among the three qualitative grade groups were statistically significant (P < .001). Overall, with an increase of one qualitative grade group, the median ADC (\u00b1standard deviation) decreased 0.18 \u00d7 10\u22123 mm2/sec \u00b1 0.02. Low-, intermediate-, and high-grade tumors had a median ADC of 1.30 \u00d7 10\u22123 mm2/sec \u00b1 0.30, 1.07 \u00d7 10\u22123 mm2/sec \u00b1 0.30, and 0.94 \u00d7 10\u22123 mm2/sec \u00b1 0.30, respectively. ROC analysis showed a discriminatory performance of Az = 0.90 in discerning low-grade from combined intermediate- and high-grade lesions. Conclusion ADCs at 3.0 T showed an inverse relationship to Gleason grades in peripheral zone prostate cancer. A high discriminatory performance was achieved in the differentiation of low-, intermediate-, and high-grade cancer. \u00a9 RSNA, 2011",
        "To establish the reference range for hepatic attenuation minus splenic attenuation difference (CT(L-S)) values on nonenhanced computed tomographic (CT) images obtained in adults with a biopsy-proved nonsteatotic liver and determine the CT(L-S) criterion for diagnosing hepatic steatosis.This retrospective study was institutional review board approved, and all subjects had provided written informed consent. The CT(L-S) was measured in 315 liver donor candidates (207 men, 108 women; mean age, 31.5 years \u00b1 10.1 [standard deviation]) who underwent nonenhanced CT of the liver and subsequent ultrasonographically guided liver biopsy on the same day. Nonenhanced liver CT was performed with a 16-section multidetector scanner in 154 individuals and with a 64-section multidetector scanner in 161 individuals. Biopsy specimens were analyzed for degree of hepatic steatosis and iron deposition. The CT(L-S) reference range was determined according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guideline C28-A3 in individuals with a histologically proved nonsteatotic liver. The sensitivity of nonenhanced CT for the diagnosis of 5% or greater and 30% or greater hepatic steatosis with use of the lower limit of the reference range as the diagnostic cutoff was determined. The effects of subject age and sex, CT scanner type, and hepatic iron on the CT(L-S) were evaluated by using multiple linear regression analysis.Ninety-six subjects (48 men, 48 women) were found to have a histologically proved nonsteatotic liver, with an estimated reference range for CT(L-S) values of 1-18 HU. With a CT(L-S) of less than 1 HU as the criterion for hepatic steatosis, the sensitivities of nonenhanced CT for 5% or greater and 30% or greater hepatic steatosis were 18.6% (29 of 156 subjects) and 67% (26 of 39 subjects), respectively. Subject age had a significant but negligible effect on CT(L-S) (0.076-HU increase per year of age, P = .009), subject sex and scanner type had no effects on CT(L-S), and hepatic iron deposition significantly increased the CT(L-S) (1.434-HU increase per increase in iron deposition grade, P = .011).The histologically proved reference range of CT(L-S) values for nonsteatotic livers was 1-18 HU. A CT(L-S) of less than 1 HU could be used as a conservative criterion for diagnosing hepatic steatosis with nonenhanced CT more consistently.",
        "To explore whether arterial spin labeling (ASL) imaging in cognitively intact elderly individuals may be used to predict subsequent early neuropsychological decline.The local ethics committee approved this prospective study, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. A total of 148 consecutive control subjects were included, 75 of whom had stable cognitive function (sCON) (mean age, 75.9 years \u00b1 3.4 [standard deviation]; 43 female) and 73 of whom had deteriorated cognitive function (dCON) at 18-month clinical follow-up (mean age, 76.8 years \u00b1 4.1; 44 female). An additional 65 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (mean age, 76.2 years \u00b1 6.1; 25 female) were also included. Two-dimensional pulsed ASL was performed at the baseline visit. Statistical analysis included whole-brain voxelwise analysis of the ASL relative cerebral blood flow (CBF) data, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and voxel-based morphometry analysis of gray matter.The voxelwise comparison of ASL revealed decreased relative CBF in the dCON group compared with that in the sCON group and slightly more pronounced relative CBF in the MCI group compared with that in the sCON group, most notably in the PCC (P < .05 corrected). Comparison of the dCON group with the MCI group revealed no significant differences. ROC analysis of relative CBF in the PCC enabled discrimination of dCON (P < .001; area under the ROC curve, 0.66). There was no confounding focal gray matter atrophy.Reduced ASL in the PCC at baseline is associated with the development of subsequent subtle neuropsychological deficits in healthy elderly control subjects. At a group level, ASL patterns in subjects with dCON are similar to those in patients with MCI at baseline, indicating that these subjects may initially maintain their cognitive status via mobilization of their neurocognitive reserve at baseline; however, they are likely to develop subsequent subtle cognitive deficits.",
        "Purpose To evaluate three coronary artery calcification (CAC) scoring methods to assess risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) death and all-cause mortality in National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) participants across levels of CAC scores. Materials and Methods The NLST was approved by the institutional review board at each participating institution, and informed consent was obtained from all participants. Image review was HIPAA compliant. Five cardiothoracic radiologists evaluated 1575 low-dose computed tomographic (CT) scans from three groups: 210 CHD deaths, 315 deaths not from CHD, and 1050 participants who were alive at conclusion of the trial. Radiologists used three scoring methods: overall visual assessment, segmented vessel-specific scoring, and Agatston scoring. Weighted Cox proportional hazards models were fit to evaluate the association between scoring methods and outcomes. Results In multivariate analysis of time to CHD death, Agatston scores of 1\u2013100, 101\u20131000, and greater than 1000 (reference category 0) were associated with hazard ratios of 1.27 (95% confidence interval: 0.69, 2.53), 3.57 (95% confidence interval: 2.14, 7.48), and 6.63 (95% confidence interval: 3.57, 14.97), respectively; hazard ratios for summed segmented vessel-specific scores of 1\u20135, 6\u201311, and 12\u201330 (reference category 0) were 1.72 (95% confidence interval: 1.05, 3.34), 5.11 (95% confidence interval: 2.92, 10.94), and 6.10 (95% confidence interval: 3.19, 14.05), respectively; and hazard ratios for overall visual assessment of mild, moderate, or heavy (reference category none) were 2.09 (95% confidence interval: 1.30, 4.16), 3.86 (95% confidence interval: 2.02, 8.20), and 6.95 (95% confidence interval: 3.73, 15.67), respectively. Conclusion By using low-dose CT performed for lung cancer screening in older, heavy smokers, a simple visual assessment of CAC can be generated for risk assessment of CHD death and all-cause mortality, which is comparable to Agatston scoring and strongly associated with outcome. \u00a9 RSNA, 2015 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To elucidate whether echogenicity (EG) of the basal ganglia and thalami (BGT) represents a physiologic phenomenon in preterm neonates (<32 weeks gestation). Materials and Methods The study was approved by the medical ethics committee, and informed consent was obtained from the parents. Sequential neonatal cranial ultrasonographic (US) images obtained in 130 preterm neonates were evaluated for EG of the BGT. In 110 of the 130 neonates, MR imaging was performed around or within the first months after term-equivalent age to assess myelination and changes in BGT signal. Cranial US studies obtained in 83 low-risk near-term neonates were used for comparison. Results Diffuse homogeneous bilateral EG of the BGT was seen in 120 (92%) of 130 preterm neonates and in seven (8%) of 83 low-risk neonates (P < .001). In preterm neonates, EG of the BGT faded with age and was no longer seen 1 month after delivery. This finding was associated with frontal echodensity, which is a normal prematurity-related cranial US phenomenon that occurs in the white matter (P < .001). No association with changes on MR images was found. Conclusion In preterm neonates, diffuse homogeneous EG of the BGT is a frequent and normal prematurity-related finding. \u00a9 RSNA, 2011 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.10101086/-/DC1",
        "Purpose To assess the position and signal intensity of the ulnar nerve at elbow extension and flexion by using magnetic resonance imaging. Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval and written informed consent were obtained. Transverse T2-weighted images were obtained perpendicular to the upper arm in 100 healthy elbows of 50 volunteers (23 men, 27 women; age range, 21-57 years) and nine elbows with ulnar neuropathy (five men, four women; age range, 24-59 years) with extension and 130\u00b0 of flexion. Ulnar nerve position was classified into three types: no dislocation, subluxation, or dislocation. One-way analysis of variance, paired t tests, Student t tests, and multiple regression analysis were used to analyze correlations between ulnar nerve movement angle during flexion and age, sex, presence of the anconeus epitrochlearis muscle, and ulnar neuropathy and to compare the contrast-to-noise ratio of nerve to muscle between extension and flexion. Results Nerve positions in healthy elbows were as follows: All had no dislocation at extension, and at flexion, 51 of 100 elbows (51.0%) had no dislocation, 30 of 100 elbows (30.0%) had subluxation, and 19 of 100 elbows (19.0%) had dislocation. Nerve movement angle was smaller in elbows with the anconeus epitrochlearis muscle than in those without the muscle (P = .045, .015). Presence of the muscle was the only significant factor associated with nerve movement angle (P = .047, .013). Only dominant elbows with nerve movement angle of less than 15\u00b0 and nondominant elbows with nerve movement angle of less than 10\u00b0 showed contrast-to-noise ratio increase at flexion (P = .021-.030). Conclusion Ulnar nerve movement during flexion was apparent in approximately half of healthy elbows and was similar between healthy elbows and elbows with ulnar neuropathy. Nerve signal intensity increased during flexion only in elbows without apparent nerve movement. (\u00a9) RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To test the feasibility of noninvasive global assessment of cerebral hemodynamic impairment with use of resting-state blood oxygenation level\u2013dependent functional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Materials and Methods In this institutional review board\u2013approved study, five patients with chronic hypoperfusion without neurologic impairment and six patients with acute stroke underwent 10-minute resting-state functional MR imaging and dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced perfusion MR imaging, which was considered the standard of reference. All patients gave informed consent. The temporal shift of low-frequency signal fluctuations in each voxel compared with the averaged whole brain or global mean signal at resting-state functional MR imaging and the delay in time to peak at dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced perfusion imaging were computed with voxel-wise analysis. The similarity of the temporal delay maps obtained with resting-state functional MR imaging and perfusion data, as well as the stability of the resting-state functional MR imaging measurement, were evaluated with the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and the two-tailed t test (random-effect analysis). Results The brain tissue with normal perfusion at dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced imaging showed no delay to global mean signal at resting-state functional MR imaging, whereas areas of abnormal perfusion with delayed time to peak (3.4 seconds \u00b1 2.1) showed a delay at resting-state functional MR imaging that was similar to the time to peak at dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced perfusion imaging, both in spatial coverage (mean DSC, 0.57 \u00b1 0.16) and tendency (t = 5.1, P < .001). Resting-state functional MR imaging measurements were highly stable (mean DSC, 0.83 \u00b1 0.12). Conclusion Resting-state functional MR imaging temporal-shift analysis can noninvasively demonstrate the extent and degree of perfusion delay in patients with hypoperfusion both with and without neurologic deficit. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "Purpose To compare the subjective Likert score to the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PIRADS) and morphology-location-signal intensity (MLS) scores for categorization of prostate lesions as benign or malignant at multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Materials and Methods Two hundred fifteen patients who underwent T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic contrast material\u2013enhanced multiparametric MR imaging of the prostate before radical prostatectomy were included in a prospective database after they signed the institutional review board\u2013approved forms. Senior readers 1 and 2 prospectively noted the location, shape, and signal intensity of lesions on MR images from individual pulse sequences and scored each for likelihood of malignancy by using a Likert scale (range, 1\u20135). A junior reader (reader 3) retrospectively reviewed the database and did the same analysis. The MLS score (range, 1\u201313) was computed by using the readers' descriptions of the lesions. Then, the three readers again scored the lesions they described by using the PIRADS score (range, 3\u201315). MLS and PIRADS scores were compared with the Likert score by using their areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves. Results Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of the Likert, MLS, and PIRADS scores were 0.81, 0.77 (P = .03), and 0.75 (P = .01) for reader 1; 0.88, 0.74 (P < .0001), and 0.76 (P < .0001) for reader 2; and 0.81, 0.78 (P = .23), and 0.75 (P = .01) for reader 3. For diagnosing cancers with Gleason scores greater than or equal to 7, the Likert score was significantly more accurate than the others, except for the MLS score for reader 3. Weighted \u03ba values were 0.470\u20130.524, 0.405\u20130.430, and 0.378\u20130.441 for the Likert, MLS, and PIRADS scores, respectively. Conclusion The Likert score allowed significantly more accurate categorization of prostate lesions on MR images than did the MLS and PIRADS scores. \u00a9 RSNA, 2014 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To examine the effects of subconcussive impacts resulting from a single season of youth (age range, 8\u201313 years) football on changes in specific white matter (WM) tracts as detected with diffusion-tensor imaging in the absence of clinically diagnosed concussions. Materials and Methods Head impact data were recorded by using the Head Impact Telemetry system and quantified as the combined-probability risk-weighted cumulative exposure (RWECP). Twenty-five male participants were evaluated for seasonal fractional anisotropy (FA) changes in specific WM tracts: the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). Fiber tracts were segmented into a central core and two fiber terminals. The relationship between seasonal FA change in the whole fiber, central core, and the fiber terminals with RWECP was also investigated. Linear regression analysis was conducted to determine the association between RWECP and change in fiber tract FA during the season. Results There were statistically significant linear relationships between RWEcp and decreased FA in the whole (R2 = 0.433; P = .003), core (R2 = 0.3649; P = .007), and terminals (R2 = 0.5666; P < .001) of left IFOF. A trend toward statistical significance (P = .08) in right SLF was observed. A statistically significant correlation between decrease in FA of the right SLF terminal and RWECP was also observed (R2 = 0.2893; P = .028). Conclusion This study found a statistically significant relationship between head impact exposure and change of FA fractional anisotropy value of whole, core, and terminals of left IFOF and right SLF's terminals where WM and gray matter intersect, in the absence of a clinically diagnosed concussion. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016",
        "Purpose To investigate whether nonhemodynamic resonant saturation effects can be detected in patients with focal epilepsy by using a phase-cycled stimulus-induced rotary saturation (PC-SIRS) approach with spin-lock (SL) preparation and whether they colocalize with the seizure onset zone and surface interictal epileptiform discharges (IED). Materials and Methods The study was approved by the local ethics committee, and all subjects gave written informed consent. Eight patients with focal epilepsy undergoing presurgical surface and intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging at 3 T with a whole-brain PC-SIRS imaging sequence with alternating SL-on and SL-off and two-dimensional echo-planar readout. The power of the SL radiofrequency pulse was set to 120 Hz to sensitize the sequence to high gamma oscillations present in epileptogenic tissue. Phase cycling was applied to capture distributed current orientations. Voxel-wise subtraction of SL-off from SL-on images enabled the separation of T2* effects from rotary saturation effects. The topography of PC-SIRS effects was compared with the seizure onset zone at intracranial EEG and with surface IED-related potentials. Bayesian statistics were used to test whether prior PC-SIRS information could improve IED source reconstruction. Results Nonhemodynamic resonant saturation effects ipsilateral to the seizure onset zone were detected in six of eight patients (concordance rate, 0.75; 95% confidence interval: 0.40, 0.94) by means of the PC-SIRS technique. They were concordant with IED surface negativity in seven of eight patients (0.88; 95% confidence interval: 0.51, 1.00). Including PC-SIRS as prior information improved the evidence of the standard EEG source models compared with the use of uninformed reconstructions (exceedance probability, 0.77 vs 0.12; Wilcoxon test of model evidence, P < .05). Nonhemodynamic resonant saturation effects resolved in patients with favorable postsurgical outcomes, but persisted in patients with postsurgical seizure recurrence. Conclusion Nonhemodynamic resonant saturation effects are detectable during interictal periods with the PC-SIRS approach in patients with epilepsy. The method may be useful for MR imaging-based detection of neuronal currents in a clinical environment. (\u00a9) RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To compare the content, clarity, and clinical usefulness of conventional (ie, free-form) and structured radiology reports of body computed tomographic (CT) scans, as evaluated by referring physicians, attending radiologists, and radiology fellows at a tertiary care cancer center.The institutional review board approved the study as a quality improvement initiative; no written consent was required. Three radiologists, three radiology fellows, three surgeons, and two medical oncologists evaluated 330 randomly selected conventional and structured radiology reports of body CT scans. For nonradiologists, reports were randomly selected from patients with diagnoses relevant to the physician's area of specialization. Each physician read 15 reports in each format and rated both the content and clarity of each report from 1 (very dissatisfied or very confusing) to 10 (very satisfied or very clear). By using a previously published radiology report grading scale, physicians graded each report's effectiveness in advancing the patient's position on the clinical spectrum. Mixed-effects models were used to test differences between report types.Mean content satisfaction ratings were 7.61 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.12, 8.16) for conventional reports and 8.33 (95% CI: 7.82, 8.86) for structured reports, and the difference was significant (P < .0001). Mean clarity satisfaction ratings were 7.45 (95% CI: 6.89, 8.02) for conventional reports and 8.25 (95% CI: 7.68, 8.82) for structured reports, and the difference was significant (P < .0001). Grade ratings did not differ significantly between conventional and structured reports.Referring clinicians and radiologists found that structured reports had better content and greater clarity than conventional reports.",
        "To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for hepatic nodules 20 mm or smaller detected during ultrasonographic (US) surveillance in patients with cirrhosis.Between November 2003 and January 2010, patients with cirrhosis with a newly US-detected solitary hepatic nodule 20 mm or smaller were included in this institutional ethics committee-approved study. All patients provided written informed consent before the study; the need to obtain consent for reanalysis of the data was waived. Patients underwent MR imaging and fine-needle biopsy (the reference standard). Nodules without pathologic confirmation were followed up with MR imaging every 6 months. A LI-RADS category was retrospectively assigned to nodules seen at MR imaging. The diagnostic accuracy for each LI-RADS category was described by sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values with 95% confidence intervals.Final diagnoses of 133 nodules in 159 patients were as follows: 102 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), three intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (ICCs), one neuroendocrine metastasis, and 27 benign lesions (median MR imaging follow-up, 95 months). None (0%) of five LI-RADS category 1 lesions, three (25%) of 12 category 2 lesions, 29 (69%) of 42 category 3 lesions, 24 (96%) of 25 category 4 lesions, and 44 (98%) of 45 category 5 lesions were HCCs. One category 3 lesion was ICC, one category 5 lesion was a neuroendocrine metastasis, and two (50%) of four lesions categorized as other malignancies were HCCs. In patients with nodules detected at surveillance US, LI-RADS category 4 criteria were as effective as category 5 criteria for HCC diagnosis. Combining both categories would improve sensitivity without impairing specificity or positive or negative predictive value for HCC diagnosis (42.3%, 98.2%, 97.8%, and 47.4% vs 65.4%, 96.4%, 97.1%, and 59.6%, respectively).In patients with cirrhosis with US-detected nodules 20 mm or smaller, both LI-RADS category 4 and category 5 have high specificity for HCC. In addition, a relevant proportion of lesions categorized as LI-RADS category 2 or 3 or as other malignancies were HCCs. Thus, active diagnostic work-up, including biopsy to allow prompt treatment, is recommended in such patients. Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "History A 56-year-old woman presented to the emergency department after a cross-country flight. While in flight, she experienced sudden onset of epigastric and midsternal chest pain with shortness of breath. Her symptoms improved markedly after she received oxygen on board, and she finished the flight without further incident. Once home later that night, the pain recurred, and she was taken to the hospital. Her history included chronic pain syndrome, hypertension, and refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, for which she had undergone radiofrequency ablation on two occasions. Her most recent ablation was 1 month prior. Upon arrival in the emergency department, her vital signs were within normal limits, and an electrocardiogram was unchanged from baseline. A chest radiograph obtained at the time of physical examination was unchanged from baseline. Given her recent travel history, there was suspicion for a pulmonary embolism. Ventilation-perfusion imaging and lower extremity Doppler ultrasonography were performed (images not shown) and revealed no evidence of pulmonary embolism or lower extremity thrombus. Because of the patient's clinical stability and because her symptoms had improved, she declined admission for observation and returned home against medical advice. The patient returned to the emergency department 2 days later in severe distress, with unstable vital signs, a jaundiced appearance, and substantial pain in her chest and abdomen. Her creatinine level was 4.4 mg/dL (388.9 \u03bcmol/L) (increased from 0.9 mg/dL [79.6 \u03bcmol/L] 2 days prior). Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were obtained and indicated increasing pericardial effusion. Bedside echocardiography enabled confirmation of these radiographic findings, and pericardiocentesis was performed. The patient's condition immediately improved, and she was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit. Her symptoms recurred 3 days later, and a pericardial drain was placed. Fluid cultures were preliminarily positive for enterococcus and gram-negative rods. After drain placement, she was scheduled for definitive treatment of recurrent symptomatic effusion. The preoperative work-up included a water-soluble contrast material-enhanced (iodixanol, 320 mg of iodine per milliliter) esophagram with computed tomography (CT) of the chest performed immediately thereafter.",

        "Purpose To develop a method for estimating the radiation dose to the conceptus from multidetector computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis in pregnant patients during the first 7 weeks of gestation. Materials and Methods This study was approved by the institutional review board and informed consent was obtained. A CT simulation software package was used to (a) develop voxelized models on the basis of image data from 117 nonpregnant patients who underwent abdominal and pelvic multidetector CT and (b) calculate dose at a position of the uterus assumed to be the position of the conceptus in case of pregnancy during the first 7 weeks of gestation. Regression analysis was carried out to establish the relationship among conceptus dose, patient body size, and distance from the conceptus to the anterior skin surface. Results Normalized conceptus doses calculated by using the software package ranged from 0.335 to 0.785 mGy per absorbed dose to air. Conceptus dose showed a significant correlation with maternal body size and conceptus depth (R2 = 0.793, P < .001). A multivariable correlation of conceptus dose normalized to the free-in-air CT dose index (CTDIF) with conceptus depth and patient perimeter was produced for estimating conceptus dose from abdominal and pelvic multidetector CT. Conceptus dose data provided for a specific scanner can be applied to other scanners by using correction factors based on ratios between the weighted CT dose index and CTDIF, resulting in inaccuracies in the estimation of conceptus dose of less than 12%. Conclusion The radiation dose to the conceptus from abdominal and pelvic multidetector CT can be estimated with a method that allows for variations in maternal body size and conceptus position. \u00a9 RSNA, 2010",
        "To retrospectively compare transition zone (TZ) cancer detection and localization accuracy of 3-T T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with that of multiparametric (MP) MR imaging, with radical prostatectomy specimens as the reference standard.The informed consent requirement was waived by the institutional review board. Inclusion criteria were radical prostatectomy specimen TZ cancer larger than 0.5 cm(3) and 3-T endorectal presurgery MP MR imaging (T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted [DW] imaging apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC] maps [b < 1000 sec/mm(2)], and dynamic contrast material-enhanced [DCE] MR imaging). From 197 patients with radical prostatectomy specimens, 28 patients with TZ cancer were included. Thirty-five patients without TZ cancer were randomly selected as a control group. Four radiologists randomly scored T2-weighted and DW ADC images, T2-weighted and DCE MR images, and T2-weighted, DW ADC, and DCE MR images. TZ cancer suspicion was rated on a five-point scale in six TZ regions of interest (ROIs). A score of 4-5 was considered a positive finding. A score of 4 or higher for any ROI containing TZ cancer was considered a positive detection result at the patient level. Generalized estimating equations were used to analyze detection and localization accuracy by using ROI-receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analyses for the latter. Gleason grade (GG) 4-5 and GG 2-3 cancers were analyzed separately.Detection accuracy did not differ between T2-weighted and MP MR imaging for all TZ cancers (68% vs 66%, P = .85), GG 4-5 TZ cancers (79% vs 72%-75%, P = .13), and GG 2-3 TZ cancers (66% vs 62%-65%, P = .47). MP MR imaging (area under the ROC curve, 0.70-0.77) did not improve T2-weighted imaging localization accuracy (AUC = 0.72) (P > .05).Use of 3-T MP MR imaging, consisting of T2-weighted imaging, DW imaging ADC maps (b values, 50, 500, and 800 sec/mm(2)), and DCE MR imaging may not improve TZ cancer detection and localization accuracy compared with T2-weighted imaging.http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.12120281/-/DC1.",
        "To compare objective and subjective image quality parameters of three image reconstruction algorithms of different generations at routine multidetector computed tomographic (CT) examinations of the abdomen.This institutional review board-approved study included 22 consecutive patients (mean age, 56.1 years \u00b1 15.8 [standard deviation]; mean weight, 79.1 kg \u00b1 14.8) who underwent routine CT examinations of the abdomen. A low-contrast phantom was used for objective quality control. Raw data sets were reconstructed by using filtered back projection (FPB), adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR), and a model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR). Radiologists used a semiquantitative scale (-3 to +3) to rate subjective image quality and artifacts, comparing both FBP and MBIR images with ASIR images. The Wilcoxon test and the intraclass correlation coefficient were used to evaluate the data. Measurements of objective noise and CT numbers of soft tissue structures were compared with analysis of variance.The phantom study revealed an improved detectability of low-contrast targets for MBIR compared with ASIR or FBP. Subjective ratings showed higher image quality for MBIR, with better resolution (median value, 2; range, 1 to 3), lower noise (2; range, 1 to 3), and finer contours (2; range, 1 to 2) compared with ASIR (all P < .001). FBP performed inferiorly (0, range, -2 to 0]; -1 [range, -3 to 0]; 0 [range, -1 to 0], respectively; all, P < .001). Mean interobserver correlation was 0.9 for image perception and 0.7 for artifacts. Objective noise for FBP was 14%-68% higher and for MBIR was 18%-47% lower than that for ASIR (P < .001).The MBIR algorithm considerably improved objective and subjective image quality parameters of routine abdominal multidetector CT images compared with those of ASIR and FBP.",
        "To assess the technical success rate and diagnostic performance of liver magnetic resonance (MR) elastography.This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board with patient informed consent. A total of 1377 consecutive MR elastography examinations performed between 2007 and 2010 in 1287 patients for clinical indications were included. Medical records were used to retrieve liver stiffness as assessed with MR elastography, histologic analysis, blood work, and other liver disease-related information. Nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis tests and analysis of covariance methods were used to evaluate the diagnostic values and relationships of the collected data.Hepatic MR elastography had a success rate of 94.4% (1300 of 1377 cases) and yielded reproducible measurements (r = 0.9716, P < .0001) in the study cohort, with a complex patient profile and multiple interpreters. Body mass index had no significant effect on success rate (P = .2). In 289 patients who underwent liver biopsy within 1 year of the MR elastography date, mean liver stiffness as assessed with MR elastography was significantly higher in patients with advanced fibrosis (stages F3, F4) than in those with mild to moderate fibrosis (stages F0, F1, F2) (5.93 kPa \u00b1 2.31 [standard deviation] vs 3.35 kPa \u00b1 1.44, P < .0001). Liver stiffness is associated with many factors other than fibrosis extent, including cause of fibrosis (viral hepatitis C vs nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, P = .025), inflammation (severe vs mild to moderate, P = .03), and hepatic metabolic and synthetic function (no fibrosis vs intermediate fibrosis, P \u2264 .01).In a general clinical practice environment, hepatic MR elastography is a robust imaging method with a high success rate in a broad spectrum of patients. It also shows the complex association between liver stiffness and hepatic pathophysiology.",
        "Purpose To investigate whether multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) developed for deep-tissue imaging in humans could enable the clinical assessment of major blood vessels and microvasculature. Materials and Methods The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University Medical Center Groningen (CCMO-NL-43587) and registered in the Dutch National Trial Registry (NTR4125). The authors designed a real-time handheld optoacoustic scanner for human use, based on a concave 8-MHz transducer array, attaining 135\u00b0 angular coverage. They applied a single-pulse-frame (SPF) sequence, which enabled motion insensitive optoacoustic imaging during handheld operation. SPF optoacoustic imaging was applied to imaging arteries and microvascular landmarks in the lower extremities of 10 healthy volunteers. The diameters selected microvessels were determined by measuring the full width at half maximum through the vessels in the MSOT images. Duplex ultrasonography was performed on the same landmarks in seven of the 10 volunteers for subjective comparison to the corresponding optoacoustic images. Results Optoacoustic imaging resolved blood vessels as small as 100 \u00b5m in diameter and within 1 cm depth. Additionally, MSOT provided images reflecting hemoglobin oxygen saturation in blood vessels, clearly identifying arteries and veins, and was able to identify pulsation in arteries during imaging. Larger blood vessels, specifically the tibialis posterior and the dorsalis pedis arteries, were also visualized with MSOT. Conclusion Handheld MSOT was found to be capable of clinical vascular imaging, providing visualization of major blood vessels and microvasculature and providing images of hemoglobin oxygen saturation and pulsation. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016",
        "To determine performance and utilization of screening breast ultrasonography (US) in women with dense breast tissue who underwent additional screening breast US in the 1st year since implementation of Connecticut Public Act 09-41 requiring radiologists to inform patients with heterogeneous or extremely dense breasts at mammography that they may benefit from such examination.Informed consent was waived for this institutional review board-approved, HIPAA-compliant retrospective review of 935 women with dense breasts at mammography who subsequently underwent handheld screening and whole-breast US from October 1, 2009, through September 30, 2010.Of 935 women, 614 (65.7%) were at low risk, 149 (15.9%) were at intermediate risk, and 87 (9.3%) were at high risk for breast cancer. Of the screening breast US examinations, in 701 (75.0%), results were classified as Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) category 1 or 2; in 187 (20.0%), results were classified as BI-RADS category 3; and in 47 (5.0%), results were classified as BI-RADS category 4. Of 63 aspirations or biopsies recommended and performed in 53 patients, in nine, lesions were BI-RADS category 3, and in 54, lesions were BI-RADS category 4. Among 63 biopsies and aspirations, three lesions were malignant (all BI-RADS category 4, diagnosed with biopsy). All three cancers were smaller than 1 cm, were found in postmenopausal patients, and were solid masses. One cancer was found in each risk group. In 44 of 935 (4.7%) patients, examination results were false-positive. Overall positive predictive value (PPV) for biopsy or aspirations performed in patients with BI-RADS category 4 masses was 6.5% (three of 46; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7%, 19%).

This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board and was fully HIPAA compliant. PAVMs were categorized as having recanalization, defined as persistence maintained by flow through a previously placed coil nest; reperfusion, defined as persistence through small feeders from adjacent normal pulmonary arteries; or incomplete treatment. Fifty-three persistent PAVMs were characterized; 38 of which had postretreatment CT data (median follow-up, 1 year). The retreatment success rate, defined by sac shrinkage on CT images, was assessed. Results Recanalization was the most common pattern, occurring in 91% (n = 48) of 53 PAVMs. Pulmonary-to-pulmonary reperfusion occurred in 24% (n = 13) of 53 PAVMs. Angioarchitecture, coil-sac distance, coil number, and feeder diameter did not significantly differ between recanalized and reperfused PAVMs. There was a significant (P = .014) difference in retreatment success; retreatment was successful in 84% (n = 27) of 32 recanalized PAVMs but only 44% (n = 4) of nine reperfused PAVMs. Conclusion Recanalization through previously placed coils is the most common pattern of PAVM persistence and responds best to retreatment. Pulmonary-to-pulmonary reperfusion is less common and more difficult to re-treat successfully. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To describe carpet lesions (laterally spreading tumors \u2265 3 cm) detected at computed tomographic (CT) colonography, including their clinical, imaging, and pathologic features. Materials and Methods The imaging reports for 9152 consecutive adults undergoing initial CT colonography at a tertiary center were reviewed in this HIPAA-compliant, institutional review board\u2013approved retrospective study to identify all potential carpet lesions detected at CT colonography. Carpet lesions were defined as morphologically flat, laterally spreading tumors 3 cm or larger. For those patients with neoplastic carpet lesions, CT colonography studies were analyzed to determine maximal lesion width and height, oral contrast material coating, segmental location, and computer-aided detection (CAD) findings. Demographic data and details of clinical treatment in these patients were reviewed. Results Eighteen carpet lesions in 18 patients (0.2%; mean age, 67.1 years; eight men, 10 women) were identified and were subsequently confirmed at colonoscopy and pathologic examination among 20 potential flat masses (\u22653 cm) prospectively identified at CT colonography (there were two nonneoplastic rectal false-positive findings). No additional neoplastic carpet lesions were found in the cohort undergoing colonoscopy after CT colonography and/or surgery (there were no false-negatives). Mean lesion width was 46.5 mm (range, 30\u201380 mm); mean lesion height was 7.9 mm (range, 4\u201314 mm). Surface retention of oral contrast material was noted in all 18 cases. All but two lesions were located in the distal rectosigmoid or proximal right colon. At CAD, 17 (94.4%) lesions were detected (mean, 6.2 CAD marks per lesion). Sixteen lesions (88.9%) demonstrated advanced histologic features, including a villous component (n = 11), high-grade dysplasia (n = 4), and invasive cancer (n = 5). Sixteen patients (88.9%) required surgical treatment for complete excision. Conclusion CT colonography can effectively depict carpet lesions. Common features in this series included older patient age, rectal or cecal location, surface coating with oral contrast material, multiple CAD hits, advanced yet typically benign histologic features, and surgical treatment. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To identify patient characteristics and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings associated with subsequent hypervascularization in hypovascular nodules that show hypointensity on hepatobiliary phase gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR images in patients with chronic liver diseases.Institutional review board approval was obtained, and informed consent was waived. At multiple follow-up gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging examinations of 68 patients, 160 hypovascular nodules were retrospectively reviewed. A Cox regression model for hypervascularization was developed to explore the association of baseline characteristics, including patient factors (Child-Pugh classification, etiology of liver disease, history of local therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC], and coexistence of hypervascular HCC) and MR imaging findings (fat content, signal intensity on T2-weighted images, and nodule size). In addition, the growth rate was calculated as the reciprocal of tumor volume doubling time to investigate its relationship with subsequent hypervascularization by using receiver operating characteristic and Kaplan-Meier analyses.The prevalence of subsequent hypervascularization was 31% (50 of 160 nodules). Independent Cox multivariable predictors of increased risk of hypervascularization were hyperintensity on T2-weighted images (hazard ratio [HR] = 8.7; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.6, 20.8), previous local therapy for hypervascular HCC (HR = 5.0; 95% CI: 1.8, 13.6), Child-Pugh B cirrhosis (HR = 3.6; 95% CI: 1.4, 9.5) and coexistence of hypervascular HCC (HR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.0, 3.8). The mean growth rate was significantly higher in nodules that showed subsequent hypervascularization than in those without hypervascularization. Kaplan-Meier analysis based on the receiver operating characteristic cutoff level (1.8 \u00d7 10(-3)/day [tumor volume doubling time, 542 days]) showed that nodules with a higher growth rate had a significantly higher incidence of hypervascularization (P = 5.2 \u00d7 10(-8), log-rank test).Hyperintensity on T2-weighted images is an independent and strong risk factor at baseline for subsequent hypervascularization in hypovascular nodules in patients with chronic liver disease. Tumor volume doubling time of less than 542 days was associated with a high rate of subsequent hypervascularization.",
        "To determine whether the reported pain severity changed significantly on the basis of specific types of pain questions posed to patients with spine augmentation.Institutional review board approval and patient consent were obtained for this HIPAA-compliant, prospective study. Patients presenting for consideration of spine augmentation between November 2008 and May 2009 were enrolled. Twenty-four patients were asked at initial presentation and at 30 days to grade their severity of back pain on a 10-point numeric rating scale in response to nine pain questions modified by the relative severity (most vs least severe), by activity (at rest vs with activity), and over time (previous day vs previous week). Statistical analysis included paired t tests to detect any differences in responses to the questions at both time points.Of the 24 patients, 15 (63%) underwent spine augmentation. For patients undergoing spine augmentation, baseline mean numeric rating score for \"worst pain with activity over the past week\" was 8.9 \u00b1 1.5 (standard deviation), compared with 2.9 \u00b1 2.7 for \"least pain at rest over the past day\" (P = .001). Interval change between baseline and 30-day assessments was relatively small for all nine questions (mean, 1.6; range, 0.2-2.2); the mean difference for eight of the nine questions did not reach statistical significance. The modifiers worst versus least and with activity versus at rest had a significant impact on the reported severity, while previous week versus previous day had minimal impact.Wide variation in the reported pain can be achieved simply by modifying specific pain questions to patients with spine augmentation.",
        "8SUMMARYINTRODUCTION / BACKGROUNDUltrasonography is an important tool in assessing gallbladder function and disorder in diabetics, bearing in mind neuropathy which is one of the long time complications, especially in type II diabetes mellitus (DM), which may affect gall bladder tone and emptying. This study evaluated gallbladder (GB) changes (fasting and postprandial) in type II DM using ultrasonography.AIMS AND OBJECTIVESEvaluating gallbladder volume and contractility index in this patients, as well as determining if there is any correlation with duration of DM and associated gall bladder stone.METHODSA prospective sonographic evaluation of the gall bladder in fasted and 45min postprandial 100 type II DM subjects ( 50 subjects with neuropathy and 50 without neuropathy ), as well as control normal healthy individuals was carried out in the Radiology department of Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital Complex (OAUTHC), Ile-Ife.DATA ANALYSISData obtained from this study was analyzed using the SPSS (version 16.0) The continuous variables were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation and student t-test was used for comparison between the subject groups to determine if there was statistical significance (p<0.05).9RESULTSDiabetic patients with neuropathy had the highest mean gallbladder volume compare to those without neuropathy and control group. The mean postprandial gall bladder volume was also highest in diabetics with neuropathy. The gallbladder ejection fraction was lowest in diabetics with neuropathy compare to those without neuropathy and control group. Longer duration of illness and doubled prevalence of gall stone is noted in diabetics with neuropathy compare to those without neuropathy and control group.CONCLUSIONThis study revealed that significant number of patients with type II DM has gall bladder abnormalities ranging from increase gall bladder volume to reduced ejection fraction (GBCI) with associated increase prevalence of gall stone disease. This is seen to be worse off in diabetics with neuropathy. Association also was established between duration of diabetes and gall bladder abnormalities.RECOMMENDATIONUltrasonography of the gall bladder therefore is highly recommended in type II DM patient management especially in those with long duration of illness as this will aid proactive management of gall bladder complication which they are prone to, and reduce morbidity and mortality.",
        "To determine the impact of cement placement immediately adjacent to and through the endplate during percutaneous vertebroplasty on postprocedural pain and subsequent fracture rate.Institutional review board approval with waived consent was obtained. Medical records of 424 patients undergoing first-time, single-level vertebroplasty for osteoporotic or traumatic compression fractures were examined. Data regarding pain at rest and with activity before the procedure, along with timing and level of subsequent fractures over a 24-month period, were collected. Group 1 (n=64) included patients with no cement extension to the endplate(s), group 2 (n=216) included those with cement extension to the endplate(s) but no leakage into the disk space(s), and group 3 (n=144) included those with cement extension to the endplate(s) and cement leakage into the disk space(s). Analysis of variance and Fisher test were used to analyze the data, with significance set at P<.05.Baseline characteristics and demographics were similar among the groups. At 1 month, for groups 1, 2, and 3, the respective mean postprocedural pain numeric scores at rest were 1.4\u00b12.7, 1.4\u00b12.4, and 1.6\u00b12.5 (P=.51), while the respective pain scores with activity were 4.3\u00b12.9, 3.8\u00b13.1, and 3.9\u00b13.3 (P=.50). Total subsequent fractures were noted in five (8%), 26 (12%), and 15 (10%) patients in group 1, 2, and 3, respectively (P=.77).Neither extension of cement to the endplate nor cement leakage into the disk space has significant impact on postprocedural pain or subsequent fracture rate at 2 years.",
        "To compare changes in signal intensity (SI) ratios of the dentate nucleus (DN) and the globus pallidus (GP) to those of other structures on unenhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images between linear and macrocyclic gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs).The study was approved by the ethical committee of the University of Heidelberg (reference no. S-324/2014). Owing to the retrospective character of the study, the ethical committee did not require any written informed consent. Two groups of 50 patients who underwent at least six consecutive MR imaging examinations with the exclusive use of either a linear GBCA (gadopentetate dimeglumine) or a macrocyclic GBCA (gadoterate meglumine) were analyzed retrospectively. The difference in mean SI ratios of DN to pons and GP to thalamus on unenhanced T1-weighted images from the last and first examinations was calculated. One-sample and independent-sample t tests were used to assess the difference in SI ratios for both groups, and regression analysis was performed to account for potential confounders.The SI ratio difference in the linear group was greater than 0 (mean DN difference \u00b1 standard deviation, 0.0407 \u00b1 0.0398 [P < .001]; GP, 0.0287 \u00b1 0.0275 [P < .001]) and significantly larger (DN, P < .001 and standardized difference of 1.16; GP, P < .001 and standardized difference of 0.81) than that in the macrocyclic group, which did not differ from 0 (DN, 0.0016 \u00b1 0.0266 [P = .680]; GP, 0.0031 \u00b1 0.0354 [P = .538]). The SI ratio difference between the last and first examinations for the DN remained significantly different between the two groups in the regression analysis (P < .001).This study indicates that an SI increase in the DN and GP on T1-weighted images is caused by serial application of the linear GBCA gadopentetate dimeglumine but not by the macrocyclic GBCA gadoterate meglumine. Clinical implications of this observation remain unclear.",
        "To evaluate a susceptibility-corrected multiecho magnetic resonance (MR) relaxometry technique for an accurate and robust determination of DeltaR2* as a noninvasive surrogate parameter of the perfused tumor blood volume.All experiments were approved by the institutional animal care committee. In a glass tube phantom with different superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) particle concentrations and at tumor mice xenografts with DU-4475, HT-1080, and MDA-MB-435 tumors (n = 15 total, n = 5 per model) with different degrees of neovascularization after injection of different ultrasmall SPIO (USPIO) doses changes of the transverse relaxation rate (DeltaR2*) were determined by using a fixed echo time (TE) of 22 msec and a susceptibility-corrected multigradient-echo technique. The mean DeltaR2* value and the vascular volume fraction (VVF) of each tumor was determined and compared with independent in vivo fluorescent tumor perfusion measurements and histologic analysis helped determine microvessel density (MVD). Statistical differences were tested by using analysis of variance and linear correlations.For the phantom study, DeltaR2* maps calculated with a fixed TE of 22 msec showed a higher standard deviation of the noise index compared with the susceptibility-corrected multiecho technique. For the xenograft model, mean tumor DeltaR2* values (+/- standard error of the mean) showed significant differences between the various tumors (eg, DU-4475: 12.3 sec(-1) +/- 2.67, HT-1080: 36.47 sec(-1) +/- 5.84, and MDA-MB-435: 64.01 sec(-1) +/- 8.87 at 80 mumol of iron per kilogram; P < .05). DeltaR2* values increased dose dependently and in a linear fashion, resulting in reproducibly stable VVF measurements. Fluorescent tumor perfusion measurements and MVD counts corroborated the MR results.Susceptibility-corrected multiecho MR relaxometry allows a highly accurate and robust determination of DeltaR2* and VVF with an excellent dynamic range for tumor characterization at clinically relevant doses of USPIO.",
        "To use coronary computed tomographic (CT) angiography to compare the prevalence, extent, and composition of coronary atherosclerotic lesions in African American and white patients with acute chest pain.The institutional review board waived the requirement for informed consent for this retrospective, HIPAA-compliant matched-cohort study. The authors analyzed the CT angiographic data of 301 patients (150 consecutive African American patients; 151 white control patients; mean age, 55 years \u00b1 11 [standard deviation]; 33% male) with acute chest pain. Each coronary artery segment was evaluated for presence of atherosclerotic plaque, plaque composition (calcified, noncalcified, or mixed), and stenosis. In addition, the noncalcified plaque volume was quantified by using a threshold-based automated algorithm. The presence and extent of atherosclerotic plaque were compared between the groups by using univariate and multivariate regression analyses.While there was no significant difference between the African American and white patients with respect to presence of any plaque (118 [79%] of 150 vs 112 [74%] of 151 patients, respectively; P = .36) or presence of stenosis (26 [17%] vs 37 [24%] patients, respectively; P = .13), the African American patients had a significantly higher prevalence (96 [64%] vs 62 [41%] patients, respectively; P < .001) and volume (median volume, 2.2 vs 1.4 mL, respectively; P < .001) of noncalcified plaque, independent of diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors (odds ratio, 2.45; 95% confidence interval: 1.52, 4.04). In contrast, the African American patients had a lower prevalence of calcified plaque (39 [26%] vs 68 [45%] white patients, P = .001).Study results suggest that atherosclerotic plaque burden and composition, as measured by using coronary CT angiography, differ between African American and white patients, with relatively more noncalcified disease in African Americans and more calcified disease in white individuals. Further research is warranted to determine whether CT plaque characterization can improve cardiac risk prediction in African Americans.",
        "The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) is a randomized multicenter study comparing low-dose helical computed tomography (CT) with chest radiography in the screening of older current and former heavy smokers for early detection of lung cancer, which is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Five-year survival rates approach 70% with surgical resection of stage IA disease; however, more than 75% of individuals have incurable locally advanced or metastatic disease, the latter having a 5-year survival of less than 5%. It is plausible that treatment should be more effective and the likelihood of death decreased if asymptomatic lung cancer is detected through screening early enough in its preclinical phase. For these reasons, there is intense interest and intuitive appeal in lung cancer screening with low-dose CT. The use of survival as the determinant of screening effectiveness is, however, confounded by the well-described biases of lead time, length, and overdiagnosis. Despite previous attempts, no test has been shown to reduce lung cancer mortality, an endpoint that circumvents screening biases and provides a definitive measure of benefit when assessed in a randomized controlled trial that enables comparison of mortality rates between screened individuals and a control group that does not undergo the screening intervention of interest. The NLST is such a trial. The rationale for and design of the NLST are presented.",
        "To determine whether adding shear-wave (SW) elastographic features could improve accuracy of ultrasonographic (US) assessment of breast masses.From September 2008 to September 2010, 958 women consented to repeat standard breast US supplemented by quantitative SW elastographic examination in this prospective multicenter institutional review board-approved, HIPAA-compliant protocol. B-mode Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) features and assessments were recorded. SW elastographic evaluation (mean, maximum, and minimum elasticity of stiffest portion of mass and surrounding tissue; lesion-to-fat elasticity ratio; ratio of SW elastographic-to-B-mode lesion diameter or area; SW elastographic lesion shape and homogeneity) was performed. Qualitative color SW elastographic stiffness was assessed independently. Nine hundred thirty-nine masses were analyzable; 102 BI-RADS category 2 masses were assumed to be benign; reference standard was available for 837 category 3 or higher lesions. Considering BI-RADS category 4a or higher as test positive for malignancy, effect of SW elastographic features on area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity after reclassifying category 3 and 4a masses was determined.Median participant age was 50 years; 289 of 939 (30.8%) masses were malignant (median mass size, 12 mm). B-mode BI-RADS AUC was 0.950; eight of 303 (2.6%) BI-RADS category 3 masses, 18 of 193 (9.3%) category 4a lesions, 41 of 97 (42%) category 4b lesions, 42 of 57 (74%) category 4c lesions, and 180 of 187 (96.3%) category 5 lesions were malignant. By using visual color stiffness to selectively upgrade category 3 and lack of stiffness to downgrade category 4a masses, specificity improved from 61.1% (397 of 650) to 78.5% (510 of 650) (P<.001); AUC increased to 0.962 (P=.005). Oval shape on SW elastographic images and quantitative maximum elasticity of 80 kPa (5.2 m/sec) or less improved specificity (69.4% [451 of 650] and 77.4% [503 of 650], P<.001 for both), without significant improvement in sensitivity or AUC.Adding SW elastographic features to BI-RADS feature analysis improved specificity of breast US mass assessment without loss of sensitivity.",
        "To evaluate the effectiveness of irreversible electroporation (IRE) in hepatic tissue ablation and the radiologic-pathologic correlation of IRE-induced cell death.On approval of the animal research committee, 16 Yorkshire pigs underwent ultrasonography (US)-guided IRE of normal liver. A total of 55 ablation zones were created, which were imaged with US, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and computed tomography (CT) and evaluated with immunohistochemical analysis, including hematoxylin-eosin (H-E), Von Kossa, and von Willibrand factor (vWF) staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay.At gross section examination, the mean diameter of the ablation zones was 33.5 mm + or - 3.0 (standard deviation) and was achieved in 6.9 minutes (mean total procedure time per ablation), with a mean difference of 2.5 mm + or - 3.6 between US and gross section measurements (r = 0.804). No complications were seen in any of the 16 animals. IRE ablation zones were well characterized with US, CT, and MR imaging, and real-time monitoring was feasible with US. H-E, Von Kossa, and vWF staining showed complete cell death, with a sharply demarcated treatment area. Bile ducts and vessels were completely preserved. Areas of complete cell death were stained positive for apoptotic markers (TUNEL, BCL-2 oncoprotein), suggesting involvement of the apoptotic process in the pathophysiology of cell death caused by IRE.In an animal model, IRE proved to be a fast, safe, and potent ablative method, causing complete tissue death by means of apoptosis. Cell death is seen with full preservation of periablative zone structures, including blood vessels, bile ducts, and neighboring nonablated tissues.",
        "To assess the effect of using computer-aided detection (CAD) in second-read mode on readers' accuracy in interpreting computed tomographic (CT) colonographic images.The contributing institutions performed the examinations under approval of their local institutional review board, with waiver of informed consent, for this HIPAA-compliant study. A cohort of 100 colonoscopy-proved cases was used: In 52 patients with findings positive for polyps, 74 polyps of 6 mm or larger were observed in 65 colonic segments; in 48 patients with findings negative for polyps, no polyps were found. Nineteen blinded readers interpreted each case at two different times, with and without the assistance of a commercial CAD system. The effect of CAD was assessed in segment-level and patient-level receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses.Thirteen (68%) of 19 readers demonstrated higher accuracy with CAD, as measured with the segment-level area under the ROC curve (AUC). The readers' average segment-level AUC with CAD (0.758) was significantly greater (P = .015) than the average AUC in the unassisted read (0.737). Readers' per-segment, per-patient, and per-polyp sensitivity for all polyps of 6 mm or larger was higher (P < .011, .007, .005, respectively) for readings with CAD compared with unassisted readings (0.517 versus 0.465, 0.521 versus 0.466, and 0.477 versus 0.422, respectively). Sensitivity for patients with at least one large polyp of 10 mm or larger was also higher (P < .047) with CAD than without (0.777 versus 0.743). Average reader sensitivity also improved with CAD by more than 0.08 for small adenomas. Use of CAD reduced specificity of readers by 0.025 (P = .05).Use of CAD resulted in a significant improvement in overall reader performance. CAD improves reader sensitivity when measured per segment, per patient, and per polyp for small polyps and adenomas and also reduces specificity by a small amount.",
        "Purpose To retrospectively compare image quality and radiation dose between a reduced-dose computed tomographic (CT) protocol that uses model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) and a standard-dose CT protocol that uses 30% adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) with filtered back projection. Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval was obtained. Clinical CT images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis obtained with a reduced-dose protocol were identified. Images were reconstructed with two algorithms: MBIR and 100% ASIR. All subjects had undergone standard-dose CT within the prior year, and the images were reconstructed with 30% ASIR. Reduced- and standard-dose images were evaluated objectively and subjectively. Reduced-dose images were evaluated for lesion detectability. Spatial resolution was assessed in a phantom. Radiation dose was estimated by using volumetric CT dose index (CTDIvol) and calculated size-specific dose estimates (SSDE). A combination of descriptive statistics, analysis of variance, and t tests was used for statistical analysis. Results In the 25 patients who underwent the reduced-dose protocol, mean decrease in CTDIvol was 46% (range, 19%\u201365%) and mean decrease in SSDE was 44% (range, 19%\u201364%). Reduced-dose MBIR images had less noise (P > .004). Spatial resolution was superior for reduced-dose MBIR images. Reduced-dose MBIR images were equivalent to standard-dose images for lungs and soft tissues (P > .05) but were inferior for bones (P = .004). Reduced-dose 100% ASIR images were inferior for soft tissues (P < .002), lungs (P < .001), and bones (P < .001). By using the same reduced-dose acquisition, lesion detectability was better (38% [32 of 84 rated lesions]) or the same (62% [52 of 84 rated lesions]) with MBIR as compared with 100% ASIR. Conclusion CT performed with a reduced-dose protocol and MBIR is feasible in the pediatric population, and it maintains diagnostic quality. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To prospectively investigate the incremental value of multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging compared with standard T2-weighted imaging for biopsy planning.The study was approved by the institutional review board; informed consent was obtained. Consecutive patients underwent T2-weighted imaging supplemented with multiparametric 1.5-T MR imaging, consisting of hydrogen 1 ((1)H) MR spectroscopy, diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging, and contrast material-enhanced MR imaging. Quantitative parameters were calculated: (choline plus creatine)-to-citrate ratio, apparent diffusion coefficient, and volume transfer constant and exchange rate constant. The prostate was divided into 20 standardized areas. Each area was classified as benign, inconclusive, or suspicious at T2-weighted imaging, followed by quantitative evaluation of all inconclusive and suspicious areas with multiparametric MR imaging. MR-guided biopsy was performed in lesions classified as suspicious for cancer with at least one of the techniques after transfer to three-dimensional T2-weighted images. Diagnostic parameters were calculated on a per-lesion and per-patient basis for all combinations of T2-weighted imaging with multiparametric MR imaging.Fifty-four patients had a median of two prior transrectal ultrasonographic biopsies with negative findings. Each patient had a median of three suspicious lesions. Prostate cancer was demonstrated in 21 of 54 patients. Biopsy was performed in 178 lesions; 53 were positive for prostate cancer. Detection rates and test negative results, respectively, were as follows: T2-weighted imaging, 70% and 50%; T2-weighted imaging and (1)H MR spectroscopy, 81% and 32%; T2-weighted imaging and contrast-enhanced MR imaging, 83% and 29%; T2-weighted imaging and DW imaging, 85% and 30%; T2-weighted imaging, (1)H MR spectroscopy, and contrast-enhanced MR imaging, 91% and 13%; T2-weighted imaging, (1)H MR spectroscopy, and DW imaging, 94% and 15%; T2-weighted imaging, DW imaging, and contrast-enhanced MR imaging, 94% and 13%; T2-weighted imaging, (1)H MR spectroscopy, DW imaging, and contrast-enhanced MR imaging, 100% and 0%.Only the combination of T2-weighted imaging with all three multiparametric techniques depicts all identifiable prostate cancers; a double combination with DW imaging and (1)H MR spectroscopy or contrast-enhanced MR imaging misses 6%, while reasonably reducing the number of areas needing biopsy.",
        "Purpose To evaluate the association of multiparametric and multiregional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging features with key molecular characteristics in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Materials and Methods Retrospective data evaluation was approved by the local ethics committee, and the requirement to obtain informed consent was waived. Preoperative MR imaging features were correlated with key molecular characteristics within a single-institution cohort of 152 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Preoperative MR imaging features (n = 31) included multiparametric (anatomic and diffusion-, perfusion-, and susceptibility-weighted images) and multiregional (contrast-enhancing regions and hyperintense regions at nonenhanced fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging) information with histogram quantification of tumor volumes, volume ratios, apparent diffusion coefficients, cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume, and intratumoral susceptibility signals. Molecular characteristics determined included global DNA methylation subgroups (eg, mesenchymal, RTK I \"PGFRA,\" RTK II \"classic\"), MGMT promoter methylation status, and hallmark copy number variations (EGFR, PDGFRA, MDM4, and CDK4 amplification; PTEN, CDKN2A, NF1, and RB1 loss). Univariate analyses (voxel-lesion symptom mapping for tumor location, Wilcoxon test for all other MR imaging features) and machine learning models were applied to study the strength of association and discriminative value of MR imaging features for predicting underlying molecular characteristics. Results There was no tumor location predilection for any of the assessed molecular parameters (permutation-adjusted P > .05). Univariate imaging parameter associations were noted for EGFR amplification and CDKN2A loss, with both demonstrating increased Gaussian-normalized relative cerebral blood volume and Gaussian-normalized relative cerebral blood flow values (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve: 63%\u201369%, false discovery rate\u2013adjusted P < .05). Subjecting all MR imaging features to machine learning\u2013based classification enabled prediction of EGFR amplification status and the RTK II glioblastoma subgroup with a moderate, yet significantly greater, accuracy (63% for EGFR [P < .01], 61% for RTK II [P = .01]) than prediction by chance; prediction accuracy for all other molecular parameters was not significant. Conclusion The authors found associations between established MR imaging features and molecular characteristics, although not of sufficient strength to enable generation of machine learning classification models for reliable and clinically meaningful prediction of molecular characteristics in patients with glioblastoma. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To assess diagnostic accuracy with diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) in patients with breast lesions and to evaluate the potential association between DKI-derived parameters and breast cancer clinical-pathologic factors.Institutional review board approval and written informed consent were obtained. Data from 97 patients (mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 45.7 years \u00b1 13.1; range, 19-70 years) with 98 lesions (57 malignant and 41 benign) who were treated between January 2014 and April 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. DKI (with b values of 0-2800 sec/mm(2)) and conventional diffusion-weighted imaging data were acquired. Kurtosis and diffusion coefficients from DKI and apparent diffusion coefficients from diffusion-weighted imaging were measured by two radiologists. Student t test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Jonckheere-Terpstra test, receiver operating characteristic curves, and Spearman correlation were used for statistical analysis.Kurtosis coefficients were significantly higher in the malignant lesions than in the benign lesions (1.05 \u00b1 0.22 vs 0.65 \u00b1 0.11, respectively; P < .0001). Diffusivity and apparent diffusion coefficients in the malignant lesions were significantly lower than those in the benign lesions (1.13 \u00b1 0.27 vs 1.97 \u00b1 0.33 and 1.02 \u00b1 0.18 vs 1.48 \u00b1 0.33, respectively; P < .0001). Significantly higher specificity for differentiation of malignant from benign lesions was shown with the use of kurtosis and diffusivity coefficients than with the use of apparent diffusion coefficients (83% [34 of 41] and 83% [34 of 41] vs 76% [31 of 41], respectively; P < .0001) with equal sensitivity (95% [54 of 57]). In patients with invasive breast cancer, kurtosis was positively correlated with tumor histologic grade (r = 0.75) and expression of the Ki-67 protein (r = 0.55). Diffusivity was negatively correlated with tumor histologic grades (r = -0.44) and Ki-67 expression (r = -0.46).DKI showed higher specificity than did conventional diffusion-weighted imaging for assessment of benign and malignant breast lesions. Patients with grade 3 breast cancer or tumors with high expression of Ki-67 were associated with higher kurtosis and lower diffusivity coefficients; however, this association must be confirmed in prospective studies.",
        "Purpose To evaluate whether microbubbles targeted to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) (CD106) coupled with a magnetic guidance system could improve the efficacy of contrast-enhanced molecular ultrasonography (US) of atherosclerosis in the aorta. Materials and Methods The animal research committee at Southern Medical University approved all experiments. Adherence of magnetic VCAM-1\u2013targeted microbubbles, control inactive magnetic microbubbles, and nonmagnetic VCAM-1\u2013targeted microbubbles to VCAM-1-Fc was determined in vitro by using a flow chamber at variable shear stress (1\u201324 dyne/cm2) under magnetic field guidance. Attachment of microbubbles under magnetic field guidance was determined in vivo with fluorescent microscopy and contrast-enhanced US of the abdominal aorta in wild-type (C57BL/6) or apolipoprotein E (APOE)\u2013deficient mice on a regular or hypercholesterolemic diet. General factorial analysis of variance was used to compare the targeted effect of the microbubbles among different animal groups to identify significant differences. Results Attachment was noted for magnetic and nonmagnetic microbubbles but not for inactive magnetic microbubbles; firm attachment at high shear stress (16\u201320 dyne/cm2) was achieved only with magnetic microbubbles. Fluorescence intensity and video intensity were significantly higher in magnetic microbubbles with magnetic field guidance than in inactive magnetic microbubbles and nonmagnetic microbubbles (P < .05). Video intensity from retained magnetic microbubbles in APOE-deficient mice was significantly greater than that in wild-type mice (mean video intensity for APOE-deficient mice: 28.25 [interquartile range, or IQR, 26.55\u201329.20] with a hypercholesterolemic diet and 16.10 [IQR, 14.15\u201318.75] with a regular diet; mean video intensity for wild-type mice: 9.55 [IQR, 8.85\u201310.5] with a hypercholesterolemic diet and 2.90 [IQR, 1.25\u20133.85] with a regular diet; P < .001). Conclusion Use of a magnetic targeted microbubble system results in greater attachment to endothelial VCAM-1 in atherosclerotic aortas in conditions of high shear stress and improved detection of early inflammatory changes of atherosclerosis. \u00a9 RSNA, 2011 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.11102251/-/DC1",
        "To compare the image quality of water-only images generated from a dual-echo Dixon technique with that of standard fast spin-echo T1-weighted chemical shift fat-suppressed images obtained in patients evaluated for pelvic pain with a 1.5-T magnetic resonance (MR) system.The ethics board granted approval for this retrospective study; patient consent was not required. Twenty-five women underwent both standard axial T1-weighted fast spin-echo chemical shift fat-suppressed imaging and dual-echo Dixon imaging of the pelvis. Two readers independently scored the acquisitions for image quality, fat suppression quality, and artifact. On the basis of signal intensity measurements, the uniformity of fat suppression, the contrast between fat-suppressed and non-fat-suppressed tissue, and the contrast between pathologic lesions and suppressed fat were calculated. Values obtained with the T1-weighted fat-suppressed and dual-echo Dixon techniques were compared by using the Wilcoxon signed rank test.The images generated with the dual-echo Dixon technique were of higher quality, had better fat suppression, and had less artifact (qualitative scores: 4.4, 4.6, and 4.0, respectively) compared with the standard T1-weighted fat-suppressed images (qualitative scores: 3.4, 3.3, and 3.6, respectively; P < .01). Contrast between fat-suppressed and non-fat-suppressed tissue (contrast ratio: 0.86 for dual-echo Dixon technique vs 0.42 for T1-weighted fat-suppressed technique, P < .001) and between pathologic lesions and suppressed fat (contrast ratio: 0.88 for dual-echo Dixon technique vs 0.57 for T1-weighted fat-suppressed technique, P =.012) was significantly improved with the dual-echo Dixon technique. Twelve pathologic lesions were identified with dual-echo Dixon imaging versus eight that were identified with T1-weighted fat-suppressed imaging.Compared with standard T1-weighted fat-suppressed imaging, dual-echo Dixon imaging facilitates improved image quality of fat-suppressed images of the pelvis, enabling better delineation of pathologic lesions.",
        "To report the results of sweep imaging with Fourier transformation (SWIFT) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for diagnostic breast imaging.Informed consent was obtained from all participants under one of two institutional review board-approved, HIPAA-compliant protocols. Twelve female patients (age range, 19-54 years; mean age, 41.2 years) and eight normal control subjects (age range, 22-56 years; mean age, 43.2 years) enrolled and completed the study from January 28, 2011, to March 5, 2013. Patients had previous lesions that were Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System 4 and 5 based on mammography and/or ultrasonographic imaging. Contrast-enhanced SWIFT imaging was completed by using a 4-T research MR imaging system. Noncontrast studies were completed in the normal control subjects. One of two sized single-breast SWIFT-compatible transceiver coils was used for nine patients and five controls. Three patients and five control subjects used a SWIFT-compatible dual breast coil. Temporal resolution was 5.9-7.5 seconds. Spatial resolution was 1.00 mm isotropic, with later examinations at 0.67 mm isotropic, and dual breast at 1.00 mm or 0.75 mm isotropic resolution.Two nonblinded breast radiologists reported SWIFT image findings of normal breast tissue, benign fibroadenomas (six of six lesions), and malignant lesions (10 of 12 lesions) concordant with other imaging modalities and pathologic reports. Two lesions in two patients were not visualized because of coil field of view. The images yielded by SWIFT showed the presence and extent of known breast lesions.The SWIFT technique could become an important addition to breast imaging modalities because it provides high spatial resolution at all points during the dynamic contrast-enhanced examination.",
        "Purpose To compare multiparametric diagnostic performance with diffusion-weighted, dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast material\u2013enhanced perfusion-weighted, and susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for differentiating primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) and atypical glioblastoma. Materials and Methods This retrospective study was institutional review board\u2013approved and informed consent was waived. Pretreatment MR imaging was performed in 314 patients with glioblastoma, and a subset of 28 patients with glioblastoma of atypical appearance (solid enhancement with no visible necrosis) was selected. Parameters of diffusion-weighted (apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC]), susceptibility-weighted (intratumoral susceptibility signals [ITSS]), and dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced perfusion-weighted (relative cerebral blood volume [rCBV]) imaging were evaluated in these 28 patients with glioblastoma and 19 immunocompetent patients with PCNSL. A two-sample t test and \u03c72 test were used to compare parameters.The diagnostic performance for differentiating PCNSL from glioblastoma was evaluated by using logistic regression analyses with leave-one-out cross validation. Results Minimum, maximum, and mean ADCs and maximum and mean rCBVs were significantly lower in patients with PCNSL than in those with glioblastoma (P < .01, respectively), whereas mean ADCs and mean rCBVs allowed the best diagnostic performance. Presence of ITSS was significantly lower in patients with PCNSL (32% [six of 19]) than in those with glioblastoma (82% [23 of 28]) (P < .01). Multiparametric assessment of mean ADC, mean rCBV, and presence of ITSS significantly increased the probability for differentiating PCNSL and atypical glioblastoma compared with the evaluation of one or two imaging parameters (P < .01), thereby correctly predicting histologic results in 95% (18 of 19) of patients with PCNSL and 96% (27 of 28) of patients with atypical glioblastoma. Conclusion Combined evaluation of mean ADC, mean rCBV, and presence of ITSS allowed reliable differentiation of PCNSL and atypical glioblastoma in most patients, and these results support an integration of advanced MR imaging techniques for the routine diagnostic workup of patients with these tumors. \u00a9 RSNA, 2014",
        "To evaluate the accuracy of spleen stiffness (SS) and liver stiffness (LS) measured by using acoustic radiation force impulse imaging in the diagnosis of portal hypertension in patients with liver cirrhosis, with the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) as a reference standard.Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained for this prospective single-center study. From February 2012 to August 2013, 60 patients with liver cirrhosis (mean age, 70.8 years; age range, 34-88 years; 34 men, 26 women) with HVPG, LS, and SS measurements and gastrointestinal endoscopy and laboratory data were included if they met the following criteria: no recent episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding, no history of splenectomy, no history of partial splenic embolization, no history of \u03b2-blocker therapy, and absence of portal thrombosis. The efficacy of the parameters for the evaluation of portal hypertension was analyzed by using the Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.The correlation coefficient between SS and HVPG (r = 0.876) was significantly better than that between LS and HVPG (r = 0.609, P < .0001). The areas under the ROC curve of SS for the identification of clinically important portal hypertension (HVPG \u2265 10 mm Hg), severe portal hypertension (HVPG \u2265 12 mm Hg), esophageal varices (EVs), and high-risk EVs were significantly higher (0.943, 0.963, 0.937, and 0.955, respectively) than those of LS, spleen diameter, platelet count, and platelet count to spleen diameter ratio (P < .05 for all). SS could be used to accurately rule out the presence of clinically important portal hypertension, severe portal hypertension, EVs, and high-risk EVs (negative likelihood ratios, 0.051, 0.056, 0.054, and 0.074, respectively).SS is reliable and has better diagnostic performance than LS for identifying portal hypertension in liver cirrhosis.",
        "Purpose To estimate the prevalence of incidental thyroid cancer (ITC) among patients undergoing thyroid surgery and to apply the Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound (SRU) guidelines to ITC. Materials and Methods This HIPAA-compliant study was approved by the institutional review board, with waiver of the need to obtain informed consent. A retrospective review of data in patients who underwent thyroid surgery between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2012, was performed. Imaging studies and reports were reviewed for ITCs that were first detected at either ultrasonography (US) or a different imaging modality and that included US as part of the work-up. ITCs were categorized by using the SRU guidelines to determine the characteristics of SRU criteria\u2013positive and SRU criteria\u2013negative malignancies. Patient demographic data, tumor histologic findings, tumor size, and tumor stage were compared for the SRU criteria\u2013positive and SRU criteria\u2013negative cancers by using the unpaired t test and the \u03c72 test. Results Among 2090 patients who underwent thyroid surgery, 680 had thyroid cancer; of these patients, 101 (15%) had imaging-detected ITC. The SRU recommendations were applied to the findings in 90 of the 101 patients who had undergone US with images or had reports available for review. Sixteen (18%) of the 90 patients had SRU criteria\u2013negative tumors, which represented 2% (16 of 680) of all thyroid cancers. SRU criteria\u2013negative tumors were smaller than SRU criteria\u2013positive tumors (mean, 1.1 cm [range, 0.9\u20131.4 cm] vs mean, 2.5 cm [range, 1.0\u20137.6 cm]; P < .001) and were more likely to be stage I (15 [94%] of 16 vs 47 [64%] of 74; P = .02). Conclusion Imaging-detected ITCs are uncommon. Two percent (16 of 680) of malignancies would not undergo fine-needle aspiration biopsy or surgery if the SRU guidelines were used for work-up of incidental thyroid nodules. SRU criteria\u2013negative tumors are lower in stage than SRU criteria\u2013positive tumors. \u00a9 RSNA, 2014",
        "Purpose To determine if high lung shunt fraction (LSF) is an independent prognostic indicator of poor survival in patients who undergo yttrium 90 radioembolization for unresectable liver-dominant metastatic colorectal cancer. Materials and Methods Retrospective data were analyzed from 606 patients (62% men; mean age, 62 years) who underwent radioembolization to treat liver metastases from colorectal adenocarcinoma between July 2002 and December 2011 at 11 U.S. centers. Institutional review board exemptions were granted prior to the collection of data at each site. Overall survival was estimated by using Kaplan-Meier survival and univariate Cox proportional hazards models to examine the effect of LSF on survival and to compare this to other potential prognostic indicators. Multivariate analysis was also performed to determine whether LSF is an independent risk factor for poor survival. Results LSF higher than 10% was predictive of significantly decreased survival (median, 6.9 months vs 10.0 months; hazard ratio, 1.60; P < .001) and demonstrated a mild but significant correlation to serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels and tumor-to-liver volume ratio (Pearson correlation coefficients, 0.105 and 0.113, respectively; P < .05). A progressive decrease in survival was observed as LSF increased from less than 5% to more than 20% (P < .05). LSF did not correlate with the presence of extrahepatic metastases or prior administration of bevacizumab. Conclusion Increased LSF is an independent prognostic indicator of worse survival in patients undergoing radioembolization for liver-dominant metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma. High LSF correlates poorly to other potential markers of tumor size, such as tumor-to-liver volume ratio or serum carcinoembryonic antigen level, and does not correlate to the presence of extrahepatic metastases. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "INTRODUCTION: Infertility is a major health problem in Nigeria, with a prevalence of 15%6 it accounts for almost two- thirds of visits to the gynecologist and the number of people with this condition is on the increase. Different invasive scientific methods such as biopsies, serum hormonal assay, endometrial secretion analysis and hysterosalpingogram had been used to study the problem of infertility in respect to the ovary and the endometrium. Ultrasound examination on the other hand is a non invasive procedure which make use of non ionizing energy for the purpose of imaging. METHODOLOGY: Two groups of infertile patients that met the set criteria\u2019s were involved in the study over a period of one year, from December 2009 to November 2010. Group A consisted of 100 infertile women whose cause of infertility is outside hypothalamic pituitary ovarian axis and were spontaneously menstruating. While group B consisted of 100 infertile women that are on ovarian stimulating drug. The women were scanned on day 10 of their menstrual cycle (i.e. before ovulation), with transabdominal technique immediately preceding transvaginal technique in a single scanning session.Image quality was assessed by the ability of each sonographic technique to resolve the endometrium into a trilamilar echo pattern as expected during the pre-ovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle and by the definition of the ovarian follicular margin which was graded as well defined or poorly defined.RESULTS: Endometrial thickness (ET), dominant follicular size, endometrial and follicular image quality of 200 infertile patients age ranging from 21 to 42years (mean 33.9years) were analysed Most patients were in the 26-35years age range (56.5%) and the least in the extremes of the age ranges.CONCLUSION: There is similarity in the use of transabdominal and transvaginal sonographic technique in the measurement of ovarian follicular size and endometrial thickness in infertile women but image resolution of transvaginal technique is superior to that of transabdominal sonographic technique.",
        "Purpose To determine the proportion of untreated Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) version 2014 category 2, 3, and 4 observations that progress, remain stable, or decrease in category and to compare the cumulative incidence of progression in category. Materials and Methods In this retrospective, longitudinal, single-center, HIPAA-compliant, institutional review board\u2013approved study, 157 patients (86 men and 71 women; mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 59.0 years \u00b1 9.7) underwent two or more multiphasic computed tomographic (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging examinations for hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance, with the first examination in 2011 or 2012. One radiologist reviewed baseline and follow-up CT and MR images (mean follow-up, 614 days). LI-RADS categories issued in the clinical reports by using version 1.0 or version 2013 were converted to version 2014 retrospectively; category modifications were verified with another radiologist. For index category LR-2, LR-3, and LR-4 observations, the proportions that progressed, remained stable, or decreased in category were calculated. Cumulative incidence curves for progression were compared according to baseline LI-RADS category (by using log-rank tests). Results All 63 index LR-2 observations remained stable or decreased in category. Among 166 index LR-3 observations, seven (4%) progressed to LR-5, and eight (5%) progressed to LR-4. Among 52 index LR-4 observations, 20 (38%) progressed to a malignant category. The cumulative incidence of progression to a malignant category was higher for index LR-4 observations than for index LR-3 or LR-2 observations (each P < .001) but was not different between LR-3 and LR-2 observations (P = .155). The cumulative incidence of progression to at least category LR-4 was trend-level higher for index LR-3 observations than for LR-2 observations (P = .0502). Conclusion Observations classified according to LI-RADS version 2014 categories are associated with different imaging outcomes. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To apply quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) in the basal ganglia of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and relate the findings to R2* mapping with regard to the sensitivity for clinical and morphologic measures of disease severity. Materials and Methods The local ethics committee approved this study, and all subjects gave written informed consent. Sixty-eight patients (26 with clinically isolated syndrome, 42 with relapsing-remitting MS) and 23 control subjects underwent 3-T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Susceptibility and R2* maps were reconstructed from the same three-dimensional multiecho spoiled gradient-echo sequence. Mean susceptibilities and R2* rates were measured in the basal ganglia and were compared between different phenotypes of the disease (clinically isolated syndrome, MS) and the control subjects by using analysis of variance, and regressing analysis was used to identify independent predictors. Results Compared with control subjects, patients with MS and clinically isolated syndrome had increased (more paramagnetic) magnetic susceptibilities in the basal ganglia. R2* mapping proved less sensitive than QSM regarding group differences. The strongest predictor of magnetic susceptibility was age. Susceptibilities were higher with increasing neurologic deficits (r = 0.34, P < .01) and lower with normalized volumes of gray matter (r = -0.35, P < .005) and the cortex (r = -0.35, P < .005). Conclusion QSM provides superior sensitivity over R2* mapping in the detection of MS-related tissue changes in the basal ganglia. With QSM but not with R2* mapping, changes were already observed in patients with clinically isolated syndrome, which suggests that QSM can serve as a sensitive measure at the earliest stage of the disease. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "To evaluate the technical quality and the diagnostic performance of a protocol with use of low volumes of contrast medium (25 mL) at 64-detector spiral computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis and management of adult, nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).This study was performed outside the United States and was approved by the institutional review board. Intracranial CT angiography was performed in 73 consecutive patients with nontraumatic SAH diagnosed at nonenhanced CT. Image quality was evaluated by two observers using two criteria: degree of arterial enhancement and venous contamination. The two independent readers evaluated diagnostic performance (lesion detection and correct therapeutic decision-making process) by using rotational angiographic findings as the standard of reference. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated for patients who underwent CT angiography and three-dimensional rotational angiography. The intraclass correlation coefficient was calculated to assess interobserver concordance concerning aneurysm measurements and therapeutic management.All aneurysms were detected, either ruptured or unruptured. Arterial opacification was excellent in 62 cases (85%), and venous contamination was absent or minor in 61 cases (84%). In 95% of cases, CT angiographic findings allowed optimal therapeutic management. The intraclass correlation coefficient ranged between 0.93 and 0.95, indicating excellent interobserver agreement.With only 25 mL of iodinated contrast medium focused on the arterial phase, 64-detector CT angiography allowed satisfactory diagnostic and therapeutic management of nontraumatic SAH.",
        "To assess whether a structural disconnection between the cerebellum and the cerebral hemispheres contributes to cerebellar and brainstem symptoms in multiple sclerosis (MS).This study was approved by the local ethics committee, and written informed consent was obtained from each participant. Brain T2 lesion load, cerebellar white matter and gray matter volumes, and tract-specific measures of the middle and superior cerebellar peduncles were derived from 172 patients with MS and 46 control subjects. Predictors of clinical impairment, which was determined at ambulation and with cerebellar and brainstem functional system scores, were identified by using random forest analysis.Of the 172 patients, 112 (65%) had middle cerebellar peduncle T2 lesions and 74 (43%) had superior cerebellar peduncle T2 lesions. T2 lesions in the middle and superior cerebellar peduncles were more common in clinically impaired patients than in unimpaired patients (P = .05 to <.0001). Most conventional magnetic resonance imaging metrics were more abnormal in impaired patients than in unimpaired patients (P = .03 to <.0001). Except for axial diffusivity, diffusivity abnormalities of the middle and superior cerebellar peduncles were more severe in clinically impaired patients than in unimpaired patients (P = .04 to <.0001). A minimal overlap was found between diffusivity abnormalities and T2 lesions. Compared with volumetric measures of T2 lesions or cerebellar atrophy, diffusivity measures of middle or superior cerebellar peduncle damage enabled better differentiation between clinically impaired and unimpaired patients (C statistics: 61%-70%).The assessment of middle and superior cerebellar peduncle damage contributes to the explanation of cerebellar and/or brainstem symptoms and ambulatory impairment in MS.",
        "To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Pipeline Embolization Device (PED; ev3/Covidien, Irvine, Calif) in the treatment of complex intracranial aneurysms.The Pipeline for Uncoilable or Failed Aneurysms is a multicenter, prospective, interventional, single-arm trial of PED for the treatment of uncoilable or failed aneurysms of the internal carotid artery. Institutional review board approval of the HIPAA-compliant study protocol was obtained from each center. After providing informed consent, 108 patients with recently unruptured large and giant wide-necked aneurysms were enrolled in the study. The primary effectiveness endpoint was angiographic evaluation that demonstrated complete aneurysm occlusion and absence of major stenosis at 180 days. The primary safety endpoint was occurrence of major ipsilateral stroke or neurologic death at 180 days.PED placement was technically successful in 107 of 108 patients (99.1%). Mean aneurysm size was 18.2 mm; 22 aneurysms (20.4%) were giant (>25 mm). Of the 106 aneurysms, 78 met the study's primary effectiveness endpoint (73.6%; 95% posterior probability interval: 64.4%-81.0%). Six of the 107 patients in the safety cohort experienced a major ipsilateral stroke or neurologic death (5.6%; 95% posterior probability interval: 2.6%-11.7%).PED offers a reasonably safe and effective treatment of large or giant intracranial internal carotid artery aneurysms, demonstrated by high rates of complete aneurysm occlusion and low rates of adverse neurologic events; even in aneurysms failing previous alternative treatments.",
        "To develop a relevant pathophysiologic model of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated dementia by studying regional variations in metabolite levels measured with magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopic imaging and their relationship to immunologic measures and cognitive dysfunction.This was a HIPAA-compliant, institutional review board-approved study involving written informed consent. Distributions of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), and creatine (Cr) concentrations in 94 subjects (20 seronegative controls and 74 HIV-positive subjects; 34 of the HIV-positive subjects having HIV-associated dementia; 63 men, 31 women; mean age, 40 years) were determined with proton (hydrogen 1 [(1)H]) MR spectroscopic imaging. HIV-positive subjects underwent neuropsychological testing and blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Factor analysis was utilized to determine associations between metabolites across regions. Analysis of variance and t tests were used to isolate differences between cohorts.A \"Cho factor\" differentiated seronegative controls from HIV-infected cohorts, indicating elevated Cho levels across deep gray and white matter regions of HIV-positive individuals. An \"NAA factor\" differentiated those with dementia from those without and correlated best with psychomotor and executive function tests. A \"Cr factor\" indicated Cr elevations correlated with CSF monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 levels. NAA and Cr factor scores were strongly weighted to metabolite changes in white matter regions.These results highlight the importance of white matter involvement in HIV-associated dementia and support the current pathogenesis model of glial cell proliferation in HIV infection, denoted by regional Cho elevations, and neuronal dysfunction and/or death, denoted by NAA decreases, associated with dementia. Factor analysis of MR spectroscopic imaging data is a useful method for determining regional metabolic variations in HIV infection and its neuropsychological correlates.",
        "To compare the influence of triggering methods for diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) parameters in the liver, as well as regional variability and measurement repeatability.In this institutional review board-approved prospective study, 12 healthy volunteers (six women, six men; mean age, 30 years) underwent 1.5-T DWI of the liver by using nine b values twice with free breathing (FB) without triggering (mean acquisition time \u00b1 standard deviation, 3.7 minutes \u00b1 0), respiratory triggering (RT) (mean acquisition time, 6.8 minutes \u00b1 1.4), and echocardiography triggering (ET) (mean acquisition time, 8.3 minutes \u00b1 2.0) after providing written informed consent. ADC and IVIM parameters, including pure diffusion coefficient (D), perfusion fraction (f), and perfusion-related diffusion coefficient (D*), were measured by using 15 regions of interest (ROIs). Regional variability of ADC and IVIM parameters and measurement repeatability were evaluated by using the coefficient of variation (CV) across ROIs and within-subject CV, respectively.ET DWI (range of CV across ROIs, 6.69%-20.0%) resulted in significantly decreased regional variability of ADC, D, and f, compared with FB DWI (13.86%-35.8%) and RT DWI (15.15%-35.91%, P \u2264. 049). ET DWI showed better repeatability of ADC measurement (within-subject CV range, 3.17%-4.12% for ET DWI; 4.15%-4.74% for FB DWI; and 2.33%-6.96% for RT DWI), D (4.05%-5.34% for ET DWI, 4.11%-12.51% for FB DWI, and 3.19%-16.17% for RT DWI), and f (7.6%-9.86% for ET DWI, 13.83%-16.81% for FB DWI, and 10.05%-12.10% for RT DWI), compared with FB DWI and RT DWI, with significant differences in within-subject CV for D in the left hepatic lobe compared with RT DWI (P = .023) and for f compared with FB DWI (P \u2264 .032). For all three imaging techniques, D* showed the worst repeatability (within-subject CV, 57.05%-156.61%) among ADC and IVIM parameters.ET DWI is more effective for decreasing regional variability of ADC and IVIM parameters than FB DWI or RT DWI; it may improve measurement repeatability by reducing cardiac motion-induced measurement error.",
        "Purpose To determine whether venous wall thickness and hoop (circumferential) stress, as determined with high-frequency ultrasonography (US), can predict cannulation readiness in arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs). Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained for this prospective study. To determine the US appearance of the venous wall, an AVF specimen was excised and scanned in a bath of degassed lactated Ringer solution with a 55-MHz probe. The appearance of the wall at high-frequency US was correlated with histologic findings. High-frequency (40\u201355-MHz) US was used to image the near-field AVF venous wall of 14 men (mean age, 59 years \u00b1 11 [standard deviation]) and six women (mean age, 55 years \u00b1 14) with newly created AVFs within 1 week of cannulation between January 2008 and December 2009. Measurements of the intima-media thickness (IMT) were generated by three independent observers who were blinded to outcomes. Intraclass correlation analysis was performed. Cannulation readiness was defined as no extravasation during the first dialysis treatment. Results By using high-frequency US, the IMT was defined as the sum of a thin echogenic blood-intima interface and a uniform hypoechoic media. The mean IMT of the no extravasation group (0.16 mm \u00b1 0.03) was greater than that of the extravasation group (0.10 mm \u00b1 0.02) (P < .001). A minimum threshold IMT of 0.13 mm (P < .001) was associated with successful cannulation. The mean hoop stress of the no extravasation group (246 kPa \u00b1 57) was lower than that of the extravasation group (530 kPa \u00b1 199) (P < .001). A maximum hoop stress threshold of 248 kPa was associated with successful cannulation (P = .009). Conclusion Venous IMT and hoop stress assessed with high-frequency US can predict cannulation readiness in AVFs that are clinically deemed mature. \u00a9 RSNA, 2011",
        "To assess whether architectural alterations exist in the white matter of patients with syndromic and complex craniosynostosis.The medical ethics committee approved this study. Written informed consent was obtained from parents or guardians before imaging. A prospective study was performed in children with syndromic and complex craniosynostosis aged 6-14 years. Forty-five patients were included: four had Apert syndrome, 14 had Crouzon-Pfeiffer syndrome, eight had Muenke syndrome, 11 had Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, and eight had complex craniosynostosis. In addition, seven control subjects were evaluated. For diffusion-tensor imaging, an echo-planar sequence was used with a diffusion gradient (b = 1000 sec/mm(2)) applied in 25 noncollinear directions. Regions of interest (ROIs) were placed in the following white matter structures: pontine crossing tract, corticospinal tracts, medial cerebral peduncles, uncinate fasciculus (measured bilaterally), anterior commissure, frontal and occipital white matter (measured bilaterally), fornix, corpus callosum (measured in the genu and splenium), and corpus cingulum (measured bilaterally). Eigenvalues were measured in all ROIs and fractional anisotropy (FA) was calculated.Across all measured ROIs, FA values were generally lower in all patients combined than in the control subjects (P < .001). There were no significant differences among subgroups of patients.Diffusion-tensor imaging measurements of white matter tracts reveal significant white matter integrity differences between children with craniosynostosis and healthy control subjects. This could imply that the developmental delays seen in these patients could be caused by the presence of a primary disorder of the white matter microarchitecture.",
        "Purpose To prospectively compare traditional filtered back projection (FBP) and iterative image reconstruction for the evaluation of heavily calcified arteries with coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography. Materials and Methods The study had institutional review board approval and was HIPAA compliant. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Fifty-five consecutive patients (35 men, 20 women; mean age, 58 years \u00b1 12 [standard deviation]) with Agatston scores of at least 400 underwent coronary CT angiography and cardiac catheterization. Image data were reconstructed with both FBP and iterative reconstruction techniques with corresponding cardiac algorithms. Image noise and subjective image quality were compared. To objectively assess the effect of FBP and iterative reconstruction on blooming artifacts, volumes of circumscribed calcifications were measured with dedicated volume analysis software. FBP and iterative reconstruction series were independently evaluated for coronary artery stenosis greater than 50%, and their diagnostic accuracy was compared, with cardiac catheterization as the reference standard. Statistical analyses included paired t tests, Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance, and a modified McNemar test. Results Image noise measured significantly lower (P = .011\u2013.035) with iterative reconstruction instead of FBP. Image quality was rated significantly higher (P = .031 and .042) with iterative reconstruction series than with FBP. Calcification volumes measured significantly lower (P = .019 and .026) with iterative reconstruction (44.3 mm3 \u00b1 64.7 and 46.2 mm3 \u00b1 68.8) than with FBP (54.5 mm3 \u00b1 69.5 and 56.3 mm3 \u00b1 72.5). Iterative reconstruction significantly improved some measures of per-segment diagnostic accuracy of coronary CT angiography for the detection of significant stenosis compared with FBP (accuracy: 95.9% vs 91.8%, P = .0001; specificity: 95.8% vs 91.2%, P = .0001; positive predictive value: 76.9% vs 61.1%, P = .0001). Conclusion Iterative reconstruction reduces image noise and blooming artifacts from calcifications, leading to improved diagnostic accuracy of coronary CT angiography in patients with heavily calcified coronary arteries. \u00a9 RSNA, 2011",
        "Purpose To determine if the obliteration of a cervical space, the paraspinal fat pad (PFP), can be used as an indicator at computed tomography (CT) of an injury of cervical spine posterior ligamentous complex (PLC). Materials and Methods This retrospective study was approved by the institutional board review; written informed consent was obtained from healthy subjects and was waived for patients. First, PFP appearance was evaluated in an anatomic specimen and in 10 healthy subjects on spine CT scans by three radiologists (readers 1, 2, and 3) working in consensus. Then, in 85 patients with suspicion of cervical spine trauma following high-velocity trauma, readers 2 and 3 reviewed in consensus the cervical spine CT (reference for fracture and luxation) and 1.5-T magnetic resonance images (T1, T2, and short inversion time inversion-recovery sequences; reference for ligament and disk injuries and contusion or occult fracture) for traumatic injuries. CT appearance of PFP was independently analyzed by readers 1 and 2, and interobserver agreement (weighted kappa) was calculated. Relationships between PFP changes and injuries and descriptive analysis were calculated by using logistic regression and Fisher test, respectively. Results The PFP could be identified as a well-circumscribed fatty area between cervical spine and posterior muscles. Interobserver agreement was 0.76. An abnormal PFP was associated with PLC (P < .001) and arch (P = .006) injuries but not with body (P = .056), longitudinal ligaments (P = .412), or disk (P = .665) injuries. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for PLC injuries were 55% (11 of 20), 97% (38 of 39), 92% (11 of 12), and 81% (38 of 47), respectively. Conclusion PFP changes on CT scans are significantly associated with injuries of PLC in patients with spine cervical trauma. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To use magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and MR arthrography to characterize the normal anatomy of the tibiofibular syndesmotic ligaments with standard and oblique imaging planes in cadavers.Ten cadaveric ankle specimens were obtained and used in accordance with institutional and HIPAA guidelines, and informed consent for research was obtained from relatives of the deceased. MR imaging was performed before and after intraarticular administration of contrast material. Proton-density-weighted MR images were correlated with anatomic slices.The anterior inferior tibiofibular ligament (AITFL) had a variable number of bands in all specimens. A separate distal band was identified in all specimens, revealing a more horizontal course than other components of the AITFL and attaching more medially to the anterior margin of the tibial plafond. The posterior inferior tibiofibular ligament (PITFL) and inferior transverse ligament were best seen in coronal oblique planes. The posterior intermalleolar ligament was observed in all specimens and had a variable appearance that ranged from a thin strand to a thick cord. The interosseous ligament (IOL) coursed obliquely to attach proximally to the tibia and insert distally in the fibula. This ligament was fenestrated with separate anterior and posterior fibers. The anterior fibers were more proximal, and the posterior fibers were more distal, attaching to the fibula in close proximity to the PITFL. Coronal images best depicted the course of the IOL.Oblique imaging planes parallel to the long axis of the ligament better display the normal anatomy of the tibiofibular syndesmotic ligaments when compared with standard imaging planes.

        "Purpose To determine the prevalence of interstitial lung abnormalities (ILAs) at initial computed tomography (CT) examination and the rate of progression of ILAs on 2-year follow-up CT images in a National Lung Screening Trial population studied at a single site. Materials and Methods The study was approved by the institutional review board and informed consent was obtained from all participants. Image review for this study was HIPAA compliant. We reviewed the CT images of 884 cigarette smokers who underwent low-dose CT at a single site in the National Lung Screening Trial. CT findings were categorized as having no evidence of ILA, equivocal for ILA, or ILA. We categorized the type of ILA as nonfibrotic (ground-glass opacity, consolidation, mosaic attenuation), or fibrotic (ground glass with reticular pattern, reticular pattern, honeycombing). We evaluated the temporal change of the CT findings (no change, improvement, or progression) of ILA at 2-year follow-up. A \u03c72 with Fisher exact test or unpaired t test was used to determine whether smoking parameters were associated with progression of ILA at 2-year follow-up CT. Results The prevalence of ILA was 9.7% (86 of 884 participants; 95% confidence interval: 7.9%, 11.9%), with a further 11.5% (102 of 884 participants) who had findings equivocal for ILA. The pattern was fibrotic in 19 (2.1%), nonfibrotic in 52 (5.9%), and mixed fibrotic and nonfibrotic in 15 (1.7%) of the 86 participants with ILA. The percentage of current smokers (P = .001) and mean number of cigarette pack-years (P = .001) were significantly higher in those with ILA than those without. At 2-year follow-up of those with ILA (n = 79), findings of nonfibrotic ILA improved in 49% of cases and progressed in 11%. Fibrotic ILA improved in 0% and progressed in 37% of cases. Conclusion ILA is common in cigarette smokers. Nonfibrotic ILA improved in about 50% of cases, and fibrotic ILA progressed in about 37%. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "To assess diagnostic sensitivity of radial T1-weighted gradient-echo (radial volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination [VIBE]) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, positron emission tomography (PET), and combined simultaneous PET and MR imaging with an integrated PET/MR system in the detection of lung nodules, with combined PET and computed tomography (CT) as a reference.In this institutional review board-approved HIPAA-compliant prospective study, 32 patients with tumors who underwent clinically warranted fluorine 18 ((18)F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT followed by PET/MR imaging were included. In all patients, the thorax station was examined with free-breathing radial VIBE MR imaging and simultaneously acquired PET data. Presence and size of nodules and FDG avidity were assessed on PET/CT, radial VIBE, PET, and PET/MR images. Percentage of nodules detected on radial VIBE and PET images was compared with that on PET/MR images by using generalized estimating equations. Maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) in pulmonary nodules with a diameter of at least 1 cm was compared between PET/CT and PET/MR imaging with Pearson rank correlation.A total of 69 nodules, including 45 FDG-avid nodules, were detected with PET/CT. The sensitivity of PET/MR imaging was 70.3% for all nodules, 95.6% for FDG-avid nodules, and 88.6% for nodules 0.5 cm in diameter or larger. PET/MR imaging had higher sensitivity than PET for all nodules (70.3% vs 61.6%, P = .002) and higher sensitivity than MR imaging for FDG-avid nodules (95.6% vs 80.0%, P = .008). There was a significantly strong correlation between SUVmax of pulmonary nodules obtained with PET/CT and that obtained with PET/MR imaging (r = 0.96, P < .001).Radial VIBE and PET data acquired simultaneously with PET/MR imaging have high sensitivity in the detection of FDG-avid nodules and nodules 0.5 cm in diameter or larger, with low sensitivity for small non-FDG-avid nodules.",
        "INTRODUCTION: In the last two decades sonography has become the most important imaging modality for the study of the spleen. Different studies were conducted in different parts of the world so as to determine the normal reference values of splenic dimension using ultrasound scan in healthy adults and the values obtained are diverse, thus prompting more work that tends to establish normal values for different regions based on geographic and racial differences.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHOD: A prospective study of normal spleen dimensions using ultrasound in 400 Nigerian adults at Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital was conducted. Sonographic measurement of splenic dimensions was done with the patient in supine and right lateral decubitus position. Height and weight were measured using standard anthropometric technique. The data was analysed using computer based SPSS 11.0 software for windows.\r\nRESULTS: There were 212 males and 188 females, their age ranged between 20 and 70 years. The mean age of the subjects was 33.0years (\u00b112.0), mean height was 1.64m (\u00b10.1) and mean weight was 61.4kg (\u00b111.0). The mean splenic length width and depth for the subjects studied were 101.6mm (\u00b113.7), 46.8mm (\u00b18.2), and 86.8mm (\u00b112.7) respectively.\r\nCONCLUSION: The mean spleen dimensions obtained in this study were similar to those\r\nobtained in other regions of Nigeria but slightly lower than those reported from studies among\r\nCaucasians confirming the need for normal values for each region. There was no statistically significant correlation of the splenic dimensions with age in either sex. There was positive correlation between subjects height and weight with splenic length (P<0.001 and P<0.001), depth (P<0.01 and P<0.001) and width (P<0.01 and P<0.001).",
        "Purpose To compare hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development after radiofrequency (RF) ablation, partial surgical hepatectomy, and a sham operation and to inhibit HCC recurrence after RF ablation in a mouse model of spontaneously forming HCC in the setting of chronic inflammation (ie, the MDR2 knockout model). Materials and Methods Animal experiments were performed according to an approved animal care committee protocol. The authors compared the survival of MDR2 knockout mice (an inflammation-induced HCC model) that underwent RF ablation, 35% partial hepatectomy (ie, left lobectomy), or a sham operation (controls) by using Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis. Tumor load and tumor frequency in mice that underwent sham operation were further compared with those of mice treated with RF ablation at 1 month after therapy by using a two-tailed Student t test. Liver slices from mice treated with RF ablation were stained for \u03b1\u2212smooth muscle actin and Ki-67 to establish the role of liver regeneration in the tumorigenic effect of RF ablation. Finally, tumor load and tumor incidence were evaluated in mice treated with a c-met inhibitor after RF ablation by using the Mann-Whitney U test. Results Ablation of 3.5% \u00b1 0.02 of the MDR2 knockout mice liver induced increased tumor load (P = .007) and reduced survival (P = .03) in comparison to that of controls, with no significant difference to the 10-fold volume removal of partial hepatectomy. Seven days after RF treatment, the border zone of the coagulation zone was surrounded by \u03b1\u2212smooth muscle actin\u2013positive activated myofibroblasts. A significant elevation of hepatocyte proliferation was also seen 7 days after RF ablation in the distant liver (ablated lobe: P = .003; untreated lobe: P = .02). A c-met inhibitor significantly attenuated HCC development in MDR2 knockout mice treated with RF ablation (P = .001). Conclusion Liver regeneration induced by RF ablation facilitates c-met/hepatocyte growth factor axis\u2013dependent HCC tumor formation after treatment in the MDR2 knockout model. Blockage of the c-met/hepatocyte growth factor axis attenuates HCC recurrence, raising the potential for therapeutic intervention to reverse this potentially deleterious tumorigenic effect. \u00a9 RSNA, 2015",
        "To determine the accuracy of texture analysis to differentiate fat-poor angiomyolipoma (fp-AML) from renal cell carcinoma (RCC) on unenhanced computed tomography (CT) images.In this institutional review board-approved retrospective case-control study, patients with AML and RCC were identified from the pathology database: there were 16 patients with fp-AML (no visible fat at unenhanced CT) and 84 patients with RCC. Axial unenhanced CT images were contoured manually by two independent analysts. Texture analysis was performed for each lesion, and reproducibility was assessed. Texture features related to the gray-level histogram, gray-level co-occurrence, and run-length matrix statistics were evaluated. The most discriminative features were used to generate support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Diagnostic accuracy of textural features was assessed and 10-fold cross validation was performed. Unenhanced CT images for each patient were independently reviewed by two blinded radiologists who subjectively graded lesion heterogeneity on a five-point scale. Differences in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) between subjective heterogeneity ratings and textural features were evaluated by using the DeLong method.There was lower lesion homogeneity and higher lesion entropy in RCCs (P \u2264 .01). A model incorporating several texture features resulted in an AUC of 0.89 \u00b1 0.04. The average SVM accuracy of textural features ranged from 83% to 91% (after 10-fold cross validation). An optimal subjective heterogeneity rating of 2 or higher was identified as a predictor of RCC for both readers, with no significant difference in AUC between readers (P = .06). Each of the three textural-based classifiers was more accurate than either radiologists' subjective heterogeneity ratings for the models incorporating a subset of the top three textural features (difference in AUC between textural features and subjective visual heterogeneity, 0.25; 95% confidence interval: 0.02, 0.47; P = .03).CT texture analysis can be used to accurately differentiate fp-AML from RCC on unenhanced CT images.",
        "To evaluate image quality of low-voltage chest computed tomographic (CT) angiography with raw data-based iterative reconstruction (sonogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction) in comparison with image quality of standard-dose standard-voltage filtered back projection (FBP) CT.This prospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and the informed consent requirement was waived. Eighty consecutive patients who were referred for follow-up chest CT angiography underwent reduced-dose CT (hereafter, T2 examination) under technical conditions similar to those of the initial examination (hereafter, T1 examination), except the voltage selection was reduced by 20 kV with adaptation of the tube current to ensure a 50% reduction in CT dose index, and regular FBP was replaced by iterative reconstruction with sonogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction. The two techniques were compared by using paired tests (Student t test, Wilcoxon test, or McNemar test, according to the nature of variables).When compared with standard-dose T1 studies, reduced-dose T2 images showed: (a) significantly less objective noise at the level of the trachea on mediastinal and lung parenchymal images (P < .001) and no significant difference in objective noise at the level of the aorta on mediastinal images (P = .507); (b) significantly higher signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise (P < .001) ratios; (c) similar visual perception of noise on mediastinal (P = .132) and lung (P = .366) images, mainly rated as moderate; and (d) similar overall subjective image quality (P = .405).Raw data-based iterative reconstruction yielded equivalent subjective and improved objective image quality of low-voltage half-dose CT angiograms compared with standard-dose FBP CT images for an average dose-length product of less than 80 mGy \u00b7 cm in this population.http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.12120414/-/DC1.",
        "To develop and validate a fast cardiac magnetic resonance imaging T1 mapping technique with high spatial resolution based on a radial inversion-recovery (IR) spoiled gradient-echo acquisition.Approval for the study was granted by the local institutional review board, and all subjects gave written informed consent. An electrocardiographically triggered radial single-shot IR (TRASSI) sequence was developed in conjunction with a custom-written fitting algorithm. The proposed imaging technique was validated in phantom measurements and then used for cardiac T1 mapping in 62 subjects with or without cardiac disease. The study population included 51 healthy subjects, three patients with arrhythmia, and eight patients with myocardial infarction. The potential heart rate dependency of the TRASSI method was tested by using linear regression analysis. Statistically significant differences between the sexes and various section orientations were analyzed with a Student t test for independent groups and a repeated-measures analysis of variance for dependent groups.High-spatial-resolution T1 maps (1.17 \u00d7 1.17 mm) without motion artifacts and without heart rate dependency (slope = -0.0303, R(2) = 0.0000887, P = .899) were acquired with an acquisition time of less than 6 seconds in all subjects. The mean T1 of healthy left ventricular myocardium across all examined subjects was 1031 msec \u00b1 33 (standard deviation). Testing for reproducibility in three individuals with 34 repetitive measurements revealed a mean standard deviation of 4.1 msec (0.412%). Subacute and chronic myocardial infarction could be detected in all eight patients. T1 disturbances due to arrhythmia proved to be minimal in three patients (standard deviation, <1.2%).Fast and accurate cardiac T1 mapping is feasible within a single-shot IR experiment.",
        "To evaluate the effectiveness of a staged ultrasonography (US) and computed tomography (CT) imaging protocol for the accurate diagnosis of suspected appendicitis in children and the opportunity for reducing the number of CT examinations and associated radiation exposure.This retrospective study was compliant with HIPAA, and a waiver of informed consent was approved by the institutional review board. This study is a review of all imaging studies obtained in children suspected of having appendicitis between 2003 and 2008 at a suburban pediatric emergency department. A multidisciplinary staged US and CT imaging protocol for the diagnosis of appendicitis was implemented in 2003. In the staged protocol, US was performed first in patients suspected of having appendicitis; follow-up CT was recommended when US findings were equivocal. Of 1228 pediatric patients who presented to the emergency department for suspected appendicitis, 631 (287 boys, 344 girls; age range, 2 months to 18 years; median age, 10 years) were compliant with the imaging pathway. The sensitivity, specificity, negative appendectomy rate (number of appendectomies with normal pathologic findings divided by the number of surgeries performed for suspected appendicitis), missed appendicitis rate, and number of CT examinations avoided by using the staged protocol were analyzed.The sensitivity and specificity of the staged protocol were 98.6% and 90.6%, respectively. The negative appendectomy rate was 8.1% (19 of 235 patients), and the missed appendicitis rate was less than 0.5% (one of 631 patients). CT was avoided in 333 of the 631 patients (53%) in whom the protocol was followed and in whom the US findings were definitive.A staged US and CT imaging protocol in which US is performed first in children suspected of having acute appendicitis is highly accurate and offers the opportunity to substantially reduce radiation.",
        "To compare the low-contrast detectability and image quality of computed tomography (CT) at different radiation dose levels reconstructed with iterative reconstruction (IR) and filtered back projection (FBP).A custom liver phantom with 12 simulated hypoattenuating tumors (diameters of 5, 10, 15, and 20 mm; tumor-to-liver contrast values of -10, -20, and -40 HU) was designed. The phantom was scanned with a standard abdominal CT protocol with a volume CT dose index of 21.6 mGy (equivalent 100% dose) and four low-dose protocols (20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% of the standard protocol dose). CT data sets were reconstructed with IR and FBP. Image noise was measured, and the tumors' contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were calculated. Tumor detection was independently assessed by three radiologists who were blinded to the CT technique used. A total of 840 simulated tumors were presented to the radiologists. Statistical analyses included analysis of variance.IR yielded an image noise reduction of 43.9%-63.9% and a CNR increase of 74.1%-180% compared with FBP at the same dose level (P < .001). The overall sensitivity for tumor detection was 64.7%-85.3% for IR and 66.3%-85.7% for FBP at the 20%-100% doses, respectively. There was no significant difference in the sensitivity for tumor detection between IR and FBP at the same dose level (P = .99). The sensitivity of the protocol at the 20% dose with FBP and IR was significantly lower than that of the protocol at the 100% dose with FBP and IR (P = .019).As the radiation dose at CT decreases, the IR algorithm does not preserve the low-contrast detectability.http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.13122349/-/DC1.",
        "This report is to complement the original Fleischner Society recommendations for incidentally detected solid nodules by proposing a set of recommendations specifically aimed at subsolid nodules. The development of a standardized approach to the interpretation and management of subsolid nodules remains critically important given that peripheral adenocarcinomas represent the most common type of lung cancer, with evidence of increasing frequency. Following an initial consideration of appropriate terminology to describe subsolid nodules and a brief review of the new classification system for peripheral lung adenocarcinomas sponsored by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC), American Thoracic Society (ATS), and European Respiratory Society (ERS), six specific recommendations were made, three with regard to solitary subsolid nodules and three with regard to multiple subsolid nodules. Each recommendation is followed first by the rationales underlying the recommendation and then by specific pertinent remarks. Finally, issues for which future research is needed are discussed. The recommendations are the result of careful review of the literature now available regarding subsolid nodules. Given the complexity of these lesions, the current recommendations are more varied than the original Fleischner Society guidelines for solid nodules. It cannot be overemphasized that these guidelines must be interpreted in light of an individual's clinical history. Given the frequency with which subsolid nodules are encountered in daily clinical practice, and notwithstanding continuing controversy on many of these issues, it is anticipated that further refinements and modifications to these recommendations will be forthcoming as information continues to emerge from ongoing research.",
        "Purpose To determine the diagnostic performance of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) parameters and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) to assess response to combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy (CRT) in patients with rectal cancer by using histogram analysis derived from whole-tumor volumes and single-section regions of interest (ROIs). Materials and Methods The institutional review board approved this retrospective study of 31 patients with rectal cancer who underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging before and after CRT, including diffusion-weighted imaging with 34 b values prior to surgery. Patient consent was not required. ADC, perfusion-related diffusion fraction (f), slow diffusion coefficient (D), and fast diffusion coefficient (D*) were calculated on MR images acquired before and after CRT by using biexponential fitting. ADC and IVIM histogram metrics and median values were obtained by using whole-tumor volume and single-section ROI analyses. All ADC and IVIM parameters obtained before and after CRT were compared with histopathologic findings by using t tests with Holm-Sidak correction. Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated to evaluate the diagnostic performance of IVIM parameters derived from whole-tumor volume and single-section ROIs for prediction of histopathologic response. Results Extreme values aside, results of histogram analysis of ADC and IVIM were equivalent to median values for tumor response assessment (P > .06). Prior to CRT, none of the median ADC and IVIM diffusion metrics correlated with subsequent tumor response (P > .36). Median D and ADC values derived from either whole-volume or single-section analysis increased significantly after CRT (P \u2264 .01) and were significantly higher in good versus poor responders (P \u2264 .02). Median IVIM f and D* values did not significantly change after CRT and were not associated with tumor response to CRT (P > .36). Interobserver agreement was excellent for whole-tumor volume analysis (range, 0.91-0.95) but was only moderate for single-section ROI analysis (range, 0.50-0.63). Conclusion Median D and ADC values obtained after CRT were useful for discrimination between good and poor responders. Histogram metrics did not add to the median values for assessment of tumor response. Volumetric analysis demonstrated better interobserver reproducibility when compared with single-section ROI analysis. (\u00a9) RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To evaluate conventional ultrasonography (US), US elasticity imaging (EI), and acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging in thyroid nodule malignancy prediction.This prospective study was institutional review board approved; informed consent was obtained. Study included 375 patients (mean age, 51 years; range, 18-75 years) with 441 pathologically proven thyroid nodules. In 281 women (mean age, 50 years; range, 18-75 years) and 94 men (mean age, 53 years; range, 18-74 years), conventional US, EI, Virtual Touch tissue imaging (VTi; Siemens, Mountain View, Calif), and Virtual Touch tissue quantification (VTq; Siemens) of ARFI imaging were performed for each nodule. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess 17 independent variables for malignancy prediction. Diagnostic performance was evaluated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.There were 325 benign and 116 malignant nodules. Marked hypoechogenicity (odds ratio [OR]: 83.88; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 17.81, 394.99) was the strongest independent predictor for thyroid malignancy, followed by shape taller than wide (OR: 8.69; 95% CI: 2.87, 26.31), VTi (OR: 6.54; 95% CI: 3.61, 11.88), moderate hypoechogenicity (OR: 3.98; 95% CI: 1.13, 14.05), poorly defined margin (OR: 3.27; 95% CI: 1.22, 8.77), female sex (OR: 2.55; 95% CI: 1.33, 4.91), coarse background of surrounding thyroid tissue (OR: 2.01; 95% CI: 1.12, 3.62), and VTq (OR: 1.78; 95% CI: 1.28, 2.47) (all P < .05). EI was not significantly associated with thyroid malignancy (P = .855). Area under the ROC curve (Az) for VTq and VTi was higher than that with other significant independent variables. Az, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.91 (95% CI: 0.87, 0.94) and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.82, 0.90), 80% and 71.6%, and 93.8% and 83.4%, respectively, for VTi and VTq. VTq of at least 2.87 m/sec and VTi of at least grade IV were the best cutoff values for malignant thyroid nodules.ARFI imaging is promising for malignant thyroid nodule prediction, with higher diagnostic performance than conventional US or EI. ARFI can be used to supplement conventional US to diagnose thyroid nodules in patients referred for surgery.",
        "To determine the performance of positron emission mammography (PEM), as compared with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, including the effect on surgical management, in ipsilateral breasts with cancer.Four hundred seventy-two women with newly diagnosed breast cancer who were offered breast-conserving surgery consented from September 2006 to November 2008 to participate in a multicenter institutional review board-approved, HIPAA-compliant protocol. Participants underwent contrast material-enhanced MR imaging and fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose PEM in randomized order; resultant images were interpreted independently. Added biopsies and changes in surgical procedure for the ipsilateral breast were correlated with histopathologic findings. Performance characteristics were compared by using the McNemar test and generalized estimating equations.Three hundred eighty-eight women (median age, 58 years; age range, 26-93 years; median estimated tumor size, 1.5 cm) completed the study. Additional cancers were found in 82 (21%) women (82 ipsilateral breasts; median tumor size, 0.7 cm). Twenty-eight (34%) of the 82 breasts were identified with both PEM and MR imaging; 21 (26%) breasts, with MR imaging only; 14 (17%) breasts, with PEM only; and seven (8.5%) breasts, with mammography and ultrasonography. Twelve (15%) cases of additional cancer were missed at all imaging examinations. Integration of PEM and MR imaging increased cancer detection-to 61 (74%) of 82 breasts versus 49 (60%) of 82 breasts identified with MR imaging alone (P < .001). Of 306 breasts without additional cancer, 279 (91.2%) were correctly assessed with PEM compared with 264 (86.3%) that were correctly assessed with MR imaging (P = .03). The positive predictive value of biopsy prompted by PEM findings (47 [66%] of 71 cases) was higher than that of biopsy prompted by MR findings (61 [53%] of 116 cases) (P = .016). Of 116 additional cancers, 61 (53%) were depicted by MR imaging and 47 (41%) were depicted by PEM (P = .043). Fifty-six (14%) of the 388 women required mastectomy: 40 (71%) of these women were identified with MR imaging, and 20 (36%) were identified with PEM (P < .001). Eleven (2.8%) women underwent unnecessary mastectomy, which was prompted by only MR findings in five women, by only PEM findings in one, and by PEM and MR findings in five. Thirty-three (8.5%) women required wider excision: 24 (73%) of these women were identified with MR imaging, and 22 (67%) were identified with PEM.PEM and MR imaging had comparable breast-level sensitivity, although MR imaging had greater lesion-level sensitivity and more accurately depicted the need for mastectomy. PEM had greater specificity at the breast and lesion levels. Eighty-nine (23%) participants required more extensive surgery: 61 (69%) of these women were identified with MR imaging, and 41 (46%) were identified with PEM (P = .003). Fourteen (3.6%) women had tumors seen only at PEM.",
        "Purpose To analyze the correlation between signal intensity in the hepatobiliary phase of gadoxetic acid\u2013enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and the expression of hepatocyte transporters with histopathologic features in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Materials and Methods Institutional ethics committee approval and informed consent were obtained. Forty surgically resected HCCs were classified as hypointense (n = 32) or iso- or hyperintense (n = 8) on the basis of findings in the hepatobiliary phase of gadoxetic acid\u2013enhanced MR imaging. The following were compared between hypointense and iso- or hyperintense HCCs: the time\u2013signal intensity curves at gadoxetic acid\u2013enhanced MR imaging, the expression levels of seven transporters (four organic anion\u2013transporting polypeptides [OATPs] and three multidrug-resistant proteins [MRPs]) at polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (for 22 nodules), results of immunostaining of OATP8, and histologic features. Statistical analysis (unpaired t test, Mann-Whitney test, \u03c72 test, and Fisher exact test) was performed for each result. Results On the time\u2013signal intensity curves, hypointense HCCs showed a decreasing pattern, whereas iso- or hyperintense HCCs showed an increasing pattern after the dynamic phase. PCR revealed that expression of OATP8 (an uptake transporter) in hypointense HCCs was lower and that in iso- or hyperintense HCCs was higher than in background liver (P < .001). The expression level of MRP3 (a sinusoidal export transporter) showed a similar trend to that of OATP8 (P < .001). Immunostaining revealed that OATP8 expression was weak in hypointense HCCs, whereas it was sustained in iso- or hyperintense HCCs (P < .001). At histologic examination, a pseudoglandular proliferation pattern with bile plugs was more commonly observed in iso- or hyperintense HCCs than in hypointense HCCs (P = .01 for proliferation patterns and P = .006 for bile plugs). Conclusion The enhancement ratio of HCCs in the hepatobiliary phase of gadoxetic acid\u2013enhanced MR imaging positively correlated with expression levels of OATP8 and MRP3, indicating that gadoxetic acid is taken up by OATP8 and excreted by MRP3. \u00a9 RSNA, 2010 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.10092214/-/DC1",
        "A 33-year-old pregnant woman (gravida 11, para 8) presented with increasing severe abdominal pain during the first trimester of pregnancy and increasing abdominal distention out of proportion to her prior pregnancies. Ultrasonography (US) without Doppler performed at another hospital had revealed a pelvic mass; therefore, this patient had been referred to our institution for further evaluation. Unenhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was then performed at 8 weeks of gestation. The main portion of the gravid uterus and the ovaries was not seen on these images, but the parts that were seen appeared normal. Diagnostic laparoscopic biopsy was performed during the first trimester, but complete removal of the mass was deferred because of fears the pregnancy would be lost. The patient was closely observed throughout the pregnancy with serial US until the 37th week of gestation, at which time the patient underwent Caesarian section. At the time of Caesarian section, the mass was noted to extend from the spleen downward deep into the pelvis. A biopsy was performed at the time of Caesarian section. Definitive removal of the mass was deferred at the time of Caesarian section to minimize postpartum blood loss and to further delineate the mass with imaging for future surgery. Intravenous contrast material-enhanced (120 mL of Omnipaque 350; Nycomed Amersham, Princeton, NJ) computed tomography (CT) was performed 3 days after Caesarian section. The cystic component measured approximately 15 HU. Repeat MR imaging 1.5 months after Caesarian section was then performed. No loss of signal intensity in the mass was seen on fat-saturated images. There was no evidence of local or distant metastatic disease. The mass abutted and displaced the uterus and the ovaries but did not distort either of these organs. Vascular anatomy was not useful in determining the origin of the mass. The comprehensive metabolic panel and complete blood count were normal throughout and after the pregnancy.",
        "Purpose To evaluate the value of computed tomographic (CT) myelography in the detection of root damage and differentiation of root avulsions from neurotmesis in a large cohort of patients with an obstetric brachial plexus lesion (OBPL). Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval was obtained. Informed consent was waived by the medical ethics committee. One hundred eighteen patients with OBPL born in the cephalic position and six patients born in the breech position were selected for surgery by two neurosurgeons in a multidisciplinary team. Functional loss of the C5 through T1 innervated muscles was noted. All patients underwent preoperative CT myelography at an average age of 19 weeks. CT myelographic examination results were reviewed by two radiologists, who were blinded to the clinical findings, for the presence of root avulsions and pseudocysts. Interobserver agreement was assessed by calculating \u03ba values. Results CT myelographic results showed root avulsions in at least one level in 66 (56%) of 118 patients born in the cephalic position and in six (100%) of six patients born in the breech position. Levels C7 and C8 showed the most root avulsions, even if not expected from clinical examination results. A large number of root avulsions showed pseudocysts (73 [68%] of 107 levels in patients born in the cephalic position and 11 [73%] of 15 levels in patients born in the breech position). Conclusion CT myelographic results showed root avulsions in more than half of patients with OBPL. Root avulsions were even detected at levels that were not expected at clinical examination. Because root avulsions require specific reconstructive techniques, CT myelography is recommended for every preoperative patient with OBPL. \u00a9 RSNA, 2011",
        "To compare the recently proposed Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) scale that incorporates fixed criteria and a standard Likert scale based on overall impression in prostate cancer localization using multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.This retrospective study was HIPAA compliant and institutional review board approved. Seventy patients who underwent 3-T pelvic MR imaging, including T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and dynamic contrast material-enhanced imaging, with a pelvic phased-array coil before radical prostatectomy were included. Three radiologists, each with 6 years of experience, independently scored 18 regions (12 peripheral zone [PZ], six transition zone [TZ]) using PI-RADS (range, scores 3-15) and Likert (range, scores 1-5) scales. Logistic regression for correlated data was used to compare scales for detection of tumors larger than 3 mm in maximal diameter at prostatectomy.Maximal accuracy was achieved with score thresholds of 8 and higher and of 3 and higher for PI-RADS and Likert scales, respectively. At these thresholds, in the PZ, similar accuracy was achieved with the PI-RADS scale and the Likert scale for radiologist 1 (89.0% vs 88.2%, P = .223) and radiologist 3 (88.5% vs 88.2%, P = .739) and greater accuracy was achieved with the PI-RADS scale than the Likert scale for radiologist 2 (89.6% vs 87.1%, P = .008). In the TZ, accuracy was lower with the PI-RADS scale than with the Likert scale for radiologist 1 (70.0% vs 87.1%, P < .001), radiologist 2 (87.6% vs 92.6%, P = .002), and radiologist 3 (82.9% vs 91.2%, P < .001). For tumors with Gleason score of at least 7, sensitivity was higher with the PI-RADS scale than with the Likert scale for radiologist 1 (88.6% vs 82.6%, P = .032), and sensitivity was similar for radiologist 2 (78.0% vs 76.5, P = .467) and radiologist 3 (77.3% vs 81.1%, P = .125).Radiologists performed well with both PI-RADS and Likert scales for tumor localization, although, in the TZ, performance was better with the Likert scale than the PI-RADS scale.http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.13122233/-/DC1.",
        "To determine the frequency of critical radiology results in 9.3 million radiology reports from our health system, to identify those containing documentation of communication by using automated text-classification algorithms, and to assess the impact of a policy requiring documentation of critical results communication.This HIPAA-compliant retrospective study received institutional review board approval. Text-mining algorithms that were previously validated to have mean accuracies of more than 90% for identifying certain critical results and documentation of communications were applied to a database of 9.3 million radiology reports. The frequency of critical results and documentation of communication were then determined from 1990 to 2011.There was an increase in documentation of communication for all critical results from 1990 to 2011. In 1990, 19.0% of reports with critical values had evidence of documentation of communication compared with 72.4% of reports in 2010. The linear trend for increasing documentation of communications began in 1997 and continued until 2011 (P < .001). From 1990 to 2011, documentation of communication was highest in acute scrotal torsion (70.6%) and ectopic pregnancy (65.4%) and lowest in unexplained free-intraperitoneal air (29.5%) and malpositioned tubes (30.4%). In 2010-2011, radiologists were least likely to document communication of results for malpositioned endotracheal and enteric tubes (2010, 58.56%; 2011, 57.50%) and unexplained free-intraperitoneal air (2010, 59.57%; 2011, 75.51%). They were most likely to document communication of results for ectopic pregnancy (2010, 94.12%; 2011, 93.48%) and acute appendicitis (2010, 86.87%; 2011, 84.31%).There was an increase in documentation of communication of critical results, which demonstrated a rising linear trend that began in 1997 and continued until 2011. The increasing trend began well before policy implementation, indicating that other factors such as heightened awareness among radiologists likely had a role.",
        "To characterize intracranial plaque inflammation in vivo by using three-dimensional (3D) high-spatial-resolution contrast material-enhanced black-blood (BB) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and to investigate the relationship between intracranial plaque inflammation and cerebrovascular ischemic events.The study was approved by the institutional review board and was HIPAA compliant. Twenty-seven patients (19 men; mean age, 56.8 years \u00b1 12.4 [standard deviation]) with cerebrovascular ischemic events (acute stroke, n = 20; subacute stroke, n = 2; chronic stroke, n = 3; transient ischemic attack, n = 2) underwent 3D time-of-flight MR angiography and contrast-enhanced BB 3-T MR imaging for intracranial atherosclerotic disease. Each identified plaque was classified as either culprit (the only or most stenotic lesion upstream from a stroke), probably culprit (not the most stenotic lesion upstream from a stroke), or nonculprit (not within the vascular territory of a stroke). Plaque contrast enhancement was categorized on BB MR images (grade 0, enhancement less than or equal to that of normal arterial walls seen elsewhere; grade 1, enhancement greater than grade 0 but less than that of the pituitary infundibulum; grade 2, enhancement greater than or equal to that of the pituitary infundibulum), and degree of contrast enhancement was calculated. Associations of the likelihood of being a culprit lesion with both plaque contrast enhancement and plaque thickness were estimated with ordinal logistic regression.Seventy-eight plaques were identified in 20 patients with acute stroke (21 [27%] culprit, 12 [15%] probably culprit, and 45 [58%] nonculprit plaques). In these patients, grade 2 contrast enhancement was associated with culprit plaques (odds ratio 34.6; 95% confidence interval: 4.5, 266.5 compared with grade 0) when adjusted for plaque thickness. Grade 0 was observed in only nonculprit plaques. Culprit plaques had a higher degree of contrast enhancement than did nonculprit plaques (25.9% \u00b1 13.4 vs 13.6% \u00b1 12.3, P = .003).Contrast enhancement of intracranial atherosclerotic plaque is associated with its likelihood to have caused a recent ischemic event and may serve as a marker of its stability, thereby providing important insight into stroke risk.",
        "To determine retrospectively the clinical effectiveness of an unenhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging protocol for evaluation of equivocal appendicitis in children.Institutional review board approval was obtained. Pediatric patients (\u226418 years old) underwent unenhanced MR imaging and contrast material-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the appendix between December 2013 and November 2014 and December 2012 and November 2013, respectively, within 24 hours after an abdominal ultrasonographic examination with results equivocal for appendicitis. Pertinent MR imaging and CT reports were reviewed for visibility of the appendix, presence of appendicitis and appendiceal perforation, and establishment of an alternative diagnosis. Surgical reports, pathologic reports, and 30-day follow-up medical records were used as reference standards. Diagnostic performance with MR imaging and CT was calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for diagnosis of appendicitis and appendiceal perforation. The Fisher exact test was used to compare proportions; the Student t test was used to compare means.Diagnostic performance with MR imaging was comparable to that with CT for equivocal pediatric appendicitis. For MR imaging (n = 103), sensitivity was 94.4% (95% CI: 72.7%, 99.9%) and specificity was 100% (95% CI: 95.8%, 100%); for CT [n = 58], sensitivity was 100% (95% CI: 71.5%, 100%), specificity was 97.9% (95% CI: 88.7%, 100%). Diagnostic performance with MR imaging and CT also was comparable for detection of appendiceal perforation, with MR imaging (n = 103) sensitivity of 90.0% (95% CI: 55.5%, 99.8%) and specificity of 85.7% (95% CI: 42.1%, 99.6%) and CT (n = 58) sensitivity of 75.0% (95% CI: 19.4%, 99.4%) and specificity of 85.7% (95% CI: 42.1%, 99.6%). The proportion of examinations with identifiable alternative diagnoses was similar at MR imaging to that at CT (19 of 103 [18.4%] vs eight of 58 [13.8%], respectively; P = .52). The proportion of appendixes seen at MR imaging and at CT also was similar (77 of 103 [74.8%] vs 50 of 58 [86.2%], respectively; P = .11).Unenhanced MR imaging is sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of equivocal appendicitis in nonsedated pediatric patients.",
        "To prospectively compare the reproducibility of normal liver apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements by using different respiratory motion compensation techniques with multiple breath-hold (MBH), free-breathing (FB), respiratory-triggered (RT), and navigator-triggered (NT) diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging and to compare the ADCs at different liver anatomic locations.The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained from each participant. Thirty-nine volunteers underwent liver DW imaging twice. Imaging was performed with a 1.5-T MR imager with MBH, FB, RT, and NT techniques (b = 0, 100, and 500 sec/mm(2)). Three representative sections--superior, central, and inferior--were selected on left and right liver lobes, respectively. On each selected section, three regions of interest were drawn, and ADCs were measured. Analysis of variance was used to assess ADCs among the four techniques and various anatomic locations. Reproducibility of ADCs was assessed with the Bland-Altman method.ADCs obtained with MBH (range: right lobe, [1.641-1.662] \u00d7 10(-3)mm(2)/sec; left lobe, [2.034-2.054] \u00d710(-3)mm(2)/sec) were higher than those obtained with FB (right, [1.349-1.391] \u00d710(-3)mm(2)/sec; left, [1.630-1.700] \u00d710(-3)mm(2)/sec), RT (right, [1.439-1.455] \u00d710(-3)mm(2)/sec; left, [1.720-1.755] \u00d710(-3)mm(2)/sec), or NT (right, [1.387-1.400] \u00d710(-3)mm(2)/sec; left, [1.661-1.736] \u00d710(-3)mm(2)/sec) techniques (P < .001); however, no significant difference was observed between ADCs obtained with FB, RT, and NT techniques (P = .130 to P >.99). ADCs showed a trend to decrease moving from left to right. Reproducibility in the left liver lobe was inferior to that in the right, and the central middle segment in the right lobe had the most reproducible ADC. Statistical differences in ADCs were observed in the left-right direction in the right lobe (P < .001), but they were not observed in the superior-inferior direction (P = .144-.450). However, in the left liver lobe, statistical differences existed in both directions (P = .001 to P = .016 in the left-right direction, P < .001 in the superior-inferior direction).Both anatomic location and DW imaging technique influence liver ADC measurements and their reproducibility. FB DW imaging is recommended for liver DW imaging because of its good reproducibility and shorter acquisition time compared with that of MBH, RT, and NT techniques.",
        "To assess interpretation performance and radiation dose when two-dimensional synthesized mammography (SM) images versus standard full-field digital mammography (FFDM) images are used alone or in combination with digital breast tomosynthesis images.A fully crossed, mode-balanced multicase (n = 123), multireader (n = 8), retrospective observer performance study was performed by using deidentified images acquired between 2008 and 2011 with institutional review board approved, HIPAA-compliant protocols, during which each patient signed informed consent. The cohort included 36 cases of biopsy-proven cancer, 35 cases of biopsy-proven benign lesions, and 52 normal or benign cases (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System [BI-RADS] score of 1 or 2) with negative 1-year follow-up results. Accuracy of sequentially reported probability of malignancy ratings and seven-category forced BI-RADS ratings was evaluated by using areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) in the random-reader analysis.Probability of malignancy-based mean AUCs for SM and FFDM images alone was 0.894 and 0.889, respectively (difference, -0.005; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.062, 0.054; P = .85). Mean AUC for SM with tomosynthesis and FFDM with tomosynthesis was 0.916 and 0.939, respectively (difference, 0.023; 95% CI: -0.011, 0.057; P = .19). In terms of the reader-specific AUCs, five readers performed better with SM alone versus FFDM alone, and all eight readers performed better with combined FFDM and tomosynthesis (absolute differences from 0.003 to 0.052). Similar results were obtained by using a nonparametric analysis of forced BI-RADS ratings.SM alone or in combination with tomosynthesis is comparable in performance to FFDM alone or in combination with tomosynthesis and may eliminate the need for FFDM as part of a routine clinical study.",
        "To assess the utility of axial and coronal reformatted multidetector computed tomographic (CT) images in the evaluation of the invasion of posterior hepatic plexuses by extrahepatic bile duct cancer.This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and informed consent was waived. Forty-three patients (22 men, 21 women; age range, 40-80 years; mean age, 65 years) with surgically resected cancer involving the extrahepatic bile duct between December 2004 and September 2010 were included. Posterior hepatic plexus 1 runs from the superior and middle bile duct to the right celiac ganglion, and posterior hepatic plexus 2 runs between the lower bile duct and right celiac ganglion behind the portal vein. Invasion of the posterior hepatic plexuses was elucidated by using pathologic and postoperative multidetector CT findings. Three radiologists independently evaluated the preoperative axial and coronal reformatted images with a separate viewing session for the invasion of posterior hepatic plexuses that was detected on the basis of the presence of increased attenuation of fat tissue along the nerve routes. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to compare the diagnostic performance of the two image interpretations.Invasion of posterior hepatic plexus 1 and of posterior hepatic plexus 2 was recognized in 10 (23%) and nine (21%) of 43 patients, respectively. The diagnostic performance of coronal reformatted image interpretation was significantly greater than that for axial image interpretation (mean area under the curve, 0.99 vs 0.89, P = .04; mean accuracy, 95% vs 82%, P = .003). In all reviewers, one false-positive diagnosis of the invasion of posterior hepatic plexus occurred on axial and/or coronal image display types because of fibrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration along these plexus routes.Coronal reformatted images can be useful for accurate diagnosis of the invasion of posterior hepatic plexuses and may facilitate surgical decision making in regard to the resection of celiac ganglion.",
        "Purpose To study the effects of the surrounding electrical microenvironment and local tissue parameters on the electrical parameters and outcome of irreversible electroporation (IRE) ablation in porcine muscle, kidney, and liver tissue. Materials and Methods Animal Care and Use Committee approval was obtained, and National Institutes of Health guidelines were followed. IRE ablation (n = 90) was applied in muscle (n = 44), kidney (n = 28), and liver (n = 18) tissue in 18 pigs. Two electrodes with tip exposure of 1.5\u20132 cm were used at varying voltages (1500\u20133000 V), pulse repetitions (n = 70\u2013100), pulse length (70\u2013100 \u00b5sec), and electrode spacing (1.5\u20132 cm). In muscle tissue, electrodes were placed exactly parallel, in plane, or perpendicular to paraspinal muscle fibers; in kidney tissue, in the cortex or adjacent to the renal medulla; and in liver tissue, with and without metallic or plastic plates placed 1\u20132 cm from electrodes. Ablation zones were determined at gross pathologic (90\u2013120 minutes after IRE) and immunohistopathologic examination (6 hours after) for apoptosis and heat-shock protein markers. Multivariate analysis of variance with multiple comparisons and/or paired t tests and regression analysis were used for analysis. Results Mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) ablation zones in muscle were 6.2 cm \u00b1 0.3 \u00d7 4.2 cm \u00b1 0.3 for parallel electrodes and 4.2 cm \u00b1 0.8 \u00d7 3.0 cm \u00b1 0.5 for in-plane application. Perpendicular orientation resulted in a cross-shaped zone. Orientation significantly affected IRE current applied (28.5\u201331.7A for parallel, 29.5\u201339.7A for perpendicular; P = .003). For kidney cortex, ovoid zones of 1.5 cm \u00b1 0.1 \u00d7 0.5 cm \u00b1 0.0 to 2.5 cm \u00b1 0.1 \u00d7 1.3 cm \u00b1 0.1 were seen. Placement of electrodes less than 5 mm from the medullary pyramids resulted in treatment effect arcing into the collecting system. For liver tissue, symmetric 2.7 cm \u00b1 0.2 \u00d7 1.4 cm \u00b1 0.3 coagulation areas were seen without the metallic plate but asymmetric coagulation was seen with the metallic plate. Conclusion IRE treatment zones are sensitive to varying electrical conductivity in tissues. Electrode location, orientation, and heterogeneities in local environment must be considered in planning ablation treatment. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To compare structured versus nonstructured reporting of multiphasic computed tomography (CT) for staging of pancreatic cancer and the effects of both types of reporting on subjective assessment of resectability.This institutional review board-approved, HIPAA-compliant retrospective study with waiver of informed consent included all patients who were referred for presurgical multiphasic CT of the pancreas between December 2006 and April 2011 at one institution before and after implementation (April 2008) of a structured reporting template. The template was created specifically for reporting multiphasic CT results to stage pancreatic cancer in patients and contained specific information relevant to surgical and oncologic planning. Multiphasic CT reports were assessed for the presence of 12 key features required for staging and surgical planning, including location, size, enhancement, node status, and vascular involvement. Three pancreatic surgeons evaluated the reports to assess resectability, surgical planning, and ease of extracting information before and after reviewing the multiphasic CT images blinded to the patient identifiers. The Student t test and \u03c7(2) test were used for statistical analysis.Forty-eight (40%) structured and 72 (60%) nonstructured multiphasic CT reports were reviewed. Nonstructured reports contained a mean \u00b1 standard deviation of 7.3 key features \u00b1 2.1 (range, 1-11) and structured reports contained 10.6 \u00b1 0.9 (range, 9-12) features (P < .001). Information for surgical planning was deemed easily accessible in 94%, 60%, and 98% of structured and 47%, 54%, and 32% of nonstructured reports by the three surgeons, respectively (P < .001, .79, < .001). Surgeons had sufficient information for surgical planning in 96%, 69%, and 98% of structured and 31%, 43%, and 25% of nonstructured reports (P < .001, .009, and < .001). When surgeons reviewed reports in combination with multiphasic CT images, they were more likely to convert an answer of \"unsure\" regarding resectability to a definitive answer (ie, resectable or unresectable) when the reports were structured than when they were nonstructured.Structured reporting of pancreatic multiphasic CT provided superior evaluation of pancreatic cancer and facilitated surgical planning. Surgeons were more confident regarding decisions about tumor resectability when they reviewed structured reports before review of multiphasic CT images.",
        "Purpose To explore the extent of signal hyperintensity in the brain on unenhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images with increasing gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) doses in patients who received 35 or more linear GBCA administrations. Materials and Methods In this institutional review board-approved HIPAA-compliant retrospective study, picture archiving and communication systems of two tertiary referral hospitals were searched to identify patients who received 35 or more linear GBCA administrations. Unenhanced T1-weighted images of the brain in patients after six, 12, and 24 GBCA administrations and after the final GBCA administration were independently reviewed by three radiologists to identify sites where T1 signal intensity was increasing. Areas identified by all three observers as increasing in T1 signal intensity when compared with baseline images were further analyzed with a quantitative region of interest analysis measuring the rate of signal increase per injection and the total change after 24 linear GBCA administrations relative to reference tissues that did not show T1 shortening. Results Qualitative analysis of 13 patients with 39-59 linear GBCA administrations showed visually detectable T1 shortening in the dentate nucleus (n = 13), globus pallidus (n = 13), substantia nigra (n = 13), posterior thalamus (n = 12), red nucleus (n = 10), colliculi (n = 10), superior cerebellar peduncle (n = 7), caudate nucleus (n = 4), whole thalamus (n = 3), and putamen (n = 2). Quantitative analysis enable confirmation of signal intensity increases on unenhanced T1-weighted images relative to reference tissues in the dentate nucleus (0.53% signal intensity increase per injection, P < .001), globus pallidus (0.23% increase, P = .009), posterior thalamus (0.26% increase, P < .001), substantia nigra (0.25% increase, P = .01), red nucleus (0.25% increase, P = .01), cerebellar peduncle (0.19% increase, P = .001), and colliculi (0.21% increase, P = .02). Conclusion Increased signal intensity on unenhanced T1-weighted images was seen in the posterior thalamus, substantia nigra, red nucleus, cerebellar peduncle, colliculi, dentate nucleus, and globus pallidus. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016.",
        "To assess the diagnostic accuracy of diffusion kurtosis magnetic resonance imaging parameters in grading gliomas.The institutional review board approved this prospective study, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Diffusion parameters-mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), mean kurtosis, and radial and axial kurtosis-were compared in the solid parts of 17 high-grade gliomas and 11 low-grade gliomas (P<.05 significance level, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test, Bonferroni correction). MD, FA, mean kurtosis, radial kurtosis, and axial kurtosis in solid tumors were also normalized to the corresponding values in contralateral normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) and the contralateral posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC) after age correction and were compared among tumor grades.Mean, radial, and axial kurtosis were significantly higher in high-grade gliomas than in low-grade gliomas (P = .02, P = .015, and P = .01, respectively). FA and MD did not significantly differ between glioma grades. All values, except for axial kurtosis, that were normalized to the values in the contralateral NAWM were significantly different between high-grade and low-grade gliomas (mean kurtosis, P = .02; radial kurtosis, P = .03; FA, P = .025; and MD, P = .03). When values were normalized to those in the contralateral PLIC, none of the considered parameters showed significant differences between high-grade and low-grade gliomas. The highest sensitivity and specificity for discriminating between high-grade and low-grade gliomas were found for mean kurtosis (71% and 82%, respectively) and mean kurtosis normalized to the value in the contralateral NAWM (100% and 73%, respectively). Optimal thresholds for mean kurtosis and mean kurtosis normalized to the value in the contralateral NAWM for differentiating high-grade from low-grade gliomas were 0.52 and 0.51, respectively.There were significant differences in kurtosis parameters between high-grade and low-grade gliomas; hence, better separation was achieved with these parameters than with conventional diffusion imaging parameters.",
        "Purpose To determine the postoperative incidence of adenomatous neoplasia in the colon proximal to an occlusive colorectal cancer where preoperative computed tomographic (CT) colonography findings were normal. Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval, with a waiver of informed consent, was obtained. This observational study included patients with occlusive colorectal cancer who underwent preoperative CT colonography between April 2007 and March 2010 that revealed normal findings (ie, no lesions \u2265 6 mm) in the proximal colon and who underwent postoperative colonoscopy. The primary outcome was postoperative colonoscopic discovery of clinically relevant lesions (ie, nondiminutive [\u22656 mm] adenomas, advanced adenomas, or cancers) in the proximal colon. The cumulative incidence of clinically relevant lesions in preoperatively normal proximal colon over the postsurgical follow-up time was analyzed by using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results The final cohort included 204 patients (102 men and 102 women; mean age, 57.3 years \u00b1 11.3 [standard deviation]). At a total of 435 postoperative colonoscopies performed over a median follow-up of 29 months (range, 1\u201374 months), clinically relevant lesions were detected in the proximal colon in 30 patients: Nonadvanced adenomas were detected in 23 patients, and advanced adenomas were detected in seven patients. The cumulative incidence of clinically relevant adenomatous lesions in the preoperatively normal proximal colon 12 and 18 months after preoperative CT colonography was 8.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.9%, 12.2%) and 9.6% (95% CI: 5%, 14%), respectively. Clinically relevant adenomatous lesions found in the proximal colon within 18 months of preoperative CT colonography were nonadvanced adenomas in 10 of 15 patients. Conclusion When the portion of the colon proximal to an occlusive cancer is devoid of nondiminutive lesions at preoperative CT colonography, colonoscopy of the proximal colon following cancer resection rarely finds clinically relevant lesions and is unlikely to reveal any lesions requiring immediate removal until routine 1-year postsurgical follow-up. \u00a9 RSNA, 2014 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To determine utility of multiparametric imaging performed at 3 T for detection of prostate cancer by using T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, MR spectroscopy, and dynamic contrast material-enhanced MR imaging, with whole-mount pathologic findings as reference standard.This prospectively designed, HIPAA-compliant, single-institution study was approved by the local institutional review board. Seventy consecutive patients (mean age, 60.4 years; mean prostate-specific antigen level, 5.47 ng/mL [5.47 microg/L]; range, 1-19.9 ng/mL [1-19.9 microg/L]) were included; informed consent was obtained from each patient. All patients had biopsy-proved prostate cancer, with a median Gleason score of 7 (range, 6-9). Images were obtained by using a combination of six-channel cardiac and endorectal coils. MR imaging and pathologic findings were evaluated independently and blinded and then correlated with histopathologic findings by using side-by-side comparison. Analyses were conducted with a raw stringent approach and an alternative neighboring method, which accounted for surgical deformation, shrinkage, and nonuniform slicing factors in pathologic specimens. Generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were used to estimate the predictive value of region-specific, pathologically determined cancer for all three modalities. This approach accounts for the correlation among multiple regions in the same individual.For T2-weighted MR imaging, sensitivity and specificity values obtained with stringent approach were 0.42 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.36, 0.47) and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.86), and for the alternative neighboring approach, sensitivity and specificity values were 0.73 (95% CI: 0.67, 0.78) and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.93), respectively. The combined diagnostic accuracy of T2-weighted MR imaging, dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging, and MR spectroscopy for peripheral zone tumors was examined by calculating their predictive value with different combinations of techniques; T2-weighted MR imaging, dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging, and MR spectroscopy provided significant independent and additive predictive value when GEEs were used (P < .001, P = .02, P = .002, respectively).Multiparametric MR imaging (T2-weighted MR imaging, MR spectroscopy, dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging) of the prostate at 3 T enables tumor detection, with reasonable sensitivity and specificity values.",
        "To compare the diagnostic yields of a radiologist and trained technologists in the detection of advanced neoplasia within a population-based computed tomographic (CT) colonography screening program.Ethical approval was obtained from the Dutch Health Council, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Nine hundred eighty-two participants (507 men, 475 women) underwent low-dose CT colonography after noncathartic bowel preparation (iodine tagging) between July 13, 2009, and January 21, 2011. Each scan was evaluated by one of three experienced radiologists (\u2265800 examinations) by using primary two-dimensional (2D) reading followed by secondary computer-aided detection (CAD) and by two of four trained technologists (\u2265200 examinations, with colonoscopic verification) by using primary 2D reading followed by three-dimensional analysis and CAD. Immediate colonoscopy was recommended for participants with lesions measuring at least 10 mm, and surveillance was recommended for participants with lesions measuring 6-9 mm. Consensus between technologists was achieved in case of discordant recommendations. Detection of advanced neoplasia (classified by a pathologist) was defined as a true-positive (TP) finding. Relative TP and false-positive (FP) fractions were calculated along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Overall, 96 of the 982 participants were referred for colonoscopy and 104 were scheduled for surveillance. Sixty of 84 participants (71%) referred for colonoscopy by the radiologist had advanced neoplasia, compared with 55 of 64 participants (86%) referred by two technologists. Both the radiologist and technologists detected all colorectal cancers (n = 5). The relative TP fraction (for technologists vs radiologist) for advanced neoplasia was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.78, 1.07), and the relative FP fraction was 0.38 (95% CI: 0.21, 0.67).Two technologists serving as a primary reader of CT colonographic images can achieve a comparable sensitivity to that of a radiologist for the detection of advanced neoplasia, with far fewer FP referrals for colonoscopy.",
        "BACKGROUND: Doppler ultrasound has emerged as the procedure of choice for monitoring the feto-placental circulation. Non-invasive, requiring no ionising radiation and with no known biohazard effects to both mother and foetus; In pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH); where a decreased placental perfusion causes intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), it can identify fetuses at risk for adverse outcome.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this research was to study the umbilical artery with Doppler ultrasound in pregnant women with PIH; and relate the umbilical artery Doppler findings to obstetric outcome.METHODS: A prospective study which involved the determination of the umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry values Systolic/Diastolic ratio (S/D), Pulsatility Index (PI), Resistivity Index (RI), its waveforms patterns in singleton foetuses of 140 pregnancy women between 24-36weeks\u2019 of gestation. The duration of the study which was carried out in the Department of Radiodiagnosis, LUTH was one year and a half.RESULTS: Data was analysed with SPSS version 18. The presence of adverse foetal and neonatal outcomes was found to be associated with worsening umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry indices. A relationship was demonstrated between abnormal Doppler ultrasonography and the occurrence of abnormal perinatal outcomes. PI was the most accurate in the prediction of intrauterine demise with an area under the curve (AUC) of 82.5% (sensitivity of 90.0% sand specificity of 66.2%).CONCLUSION: Ultrasonography is a useful tool in predicting at risk foetuses in PIH, enabling early intervention which in more technologically advanced environment has significantly reduced maternal and foetal morbidity and mortality Therefore, its use should be encouraged in our environment.KEYWORDS: PIH; IUGR; Umbilical Artery Doppler, AUC.",
        "Purpose To evaluate clinical and immediate postoperative ultrasonographic (US) risk factors associated with vascular thrombosis of pediatric en bloc kidney grafts. Materials and Methods This institutional review board-approved HIPAA-compliant retrospective study consisted of 195 recipients of pediatric en bloc kidney grafts throughout a 10-year period. The average recipient and donor age was 45 years (range, 7-74 years) and 9 months (range, 0-84 months), respectively. Clinical factors and immediate postoperative US findings were assessed. Categorical variables were evaluated by using the Fisher exact test and linear models with generalized estimating equations. Results Seventeen patients (23 kidneys) experienced thrombotic events. In six patients (eight kidneys), thrombosis occurred intraoperatively. The remaining 11 patients (15 kidneys) received a diagnosis of thrombosis on postoperative days 1-13. Recipients more than 40 years old had a higher incidence of arterial thrombosis than did younger recipients (eight of 62 vs three of 133, respectively; P < .01). Recipients were more likely to develop thrombosis with donor weight less than 5 kg (10 of 52 vs seven of 140 with donor weight of \u2265 5 kg; P < .01), with intraoperative perfusional concern (10 of 21 vs seven of 174 without; P < .01), or with right-sided allograft placement (10 of 64 vs seven of 131 left sided; P = .03). At US of the 15 postoperative thrombotic events, the incidence of thrombosis was greater when donor arterial velocity was less than 100 cm/sec (seven of 56 vs four of 126 with velocity \u2265 100 cm/sec; P = .04). An intrarenal arterial resistive index of less than 0.6 was associated with higher incidence of arterial thrombosis (nine of 123 vs zero of 217, respectively; P = .01). A resistive index greater than 0.8 was associated with a higher incidence of venous thrombosis (four of 13 vs one of 217, respectively; P = .04). Conclusion Clinical factors and immediate US findings can help stratify patients receiving pediatric en bloc kidneys into risk categories for vascular thrombosis that, if proven in prospective studies, could affect immediate postoperative treatment.

        "Purpose To retrospectively investigate whether the background parenchymal features around a tumor at preoperative dynamic contrast material\u2013enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging are associated with ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR)\u2013free survival in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) after breast conservation surgery. Materials and Methods The institutional review board approved this study, and the requirement for informed consent was waived. Between 2004 and 2009, 215 consecutive women with pure DCIS who had undergone preoperative dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging and curative breast conservation surgery were identified. Clinical-pathologic features (age, menopausal status, presentation of clinical findings, biopsy method, tumor size, nuclear grade, hormonal receptor status, margin status, and adjuvant therapy) and MR imaging features (lesion size, background parenchymal enhancement grade, fibroglandular density, parenchymal signal enhancement ratio [SER] around the tumor, lesion type, and lesion kinetics) were analyzed. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine the association between MR imaging variables and IBTR-free survival after controlling for clinical-pathologic variables. Reproducibility of SER measurements was evaluated by using the intraclass correlation coefficient. Results There were 15 of 215 (7.0%) IBTR cases (nine DCIS cases and six invasive cases) at a median of 36 months (range, 11\u201361 months). Multivariate analysis showed that higher parenchymal SER (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.028, P < .001 for reader 1; HR = 1.652, P < .001 for reader 2) and larger histologic tumor size (HR = 1.360, P = .009 for reader 1; HR = 1.402, P = .006 for reader 2) were independent factors associated with worse IBTR-free survival. The intraclass correlation coefficient of SER measurements between two readers was 0.852 (95% confidence interval: 0.811, 0.885). Conclusion Higher parenchymal SER around the tumor at preoperative dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging and larger histologic tumor size were independent factors associated with worse IBTR-free survival in patients with DCIS after breast conservation surgery. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "To describe the use of an imaging selection tool, multiphase computed tomographic (CT) angiography, in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and to demonstrate its interrater reliability and ability to help determine clinical outcome.The local ethics board approved this study. Data are from the pilot phase of PRoveIT, a prospective observational study analyzing utility of multimodal imaging in the triage of patients with AIS. Patients underwent baseline unenhanced CT, single-phase CT angiography of the head and neck, multiphase CT angiography, and perfusion CT. Multiphase CT angiography generates time-resolved images of pial arteries. Pial arterial filling was scored on a six-point ordinal scale, and interrater reliability was tested. Clinical outcomes included a 50% or greater decrease in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) over 24 hours and 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-2. The ability to predict clinical outcomes was compared between single-phase CT angiography, multiphase CT angiography, and perfusion CT by using receiver operating curve analysis, Akaike information criterion (AIC), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC).A total of 147 patients were included. Interrater reliability for multiphase CT angiography is excellent (n = 30, \u03ba = 0.81, P < .001). At receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the ability to predict clinical outcome is modest (C statistic = 0.56, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.52, 0.63 for \u226550% decrease in NIHSS over 24 hours; C statistic = 0.6, 95% CI: 0.53, 0.68 for 90-day mRS score of 0-2) but better than that of models using single-phase CT angiography and perfusion CT (P < .05 overall). With AIC and BIC, models that use multiphase CT angiography are better than models that use single-phase CT angiography and perfusion CT for a decrease of 50% or more in NIHSS over 24 hours (AIC = 166, BIC = 171.7; values were lowest for multiphase CT angiography) and a 90-day mRS score of 0-2 (AIC = 132.1, BIC = 137.4; values were lowest for multiphase CT angiography).Multiphase CT angiography is a reliable tool for imaging selection in patients with AIS.",
        "To retrospectively evaluate the diagnostic performance of multiparametric endorectal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, including T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted (DW), and dynamic contrast material-enhanced (DCE) MR techniques, for the diagnosis of seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) and to determine the incremental value of DW MR and DCE MR images.This retrospective HIPAA-compliant study was approved by the institutional review board, with a waiver of informed consent. The study included 131 patients (mean age, 68 years; range, 43-75 years) who underwent endorectal MR imaging before radical prostatectomy between January 2007 and April 2010. Two radiologists (A: experienced, B: less experienced) estimated the likelihood of SVI by using a five-point ordinal scale in three image-viewing settings: T2-weighted images alone; T2-weighted and DW MR images; and T2-weighted, DW MR, and DCE MR images. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated. Confidence intervals estimated with bootstrapping and the McNemar test or Fisher exact test were used to compare sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value.Of the 131 patients, 23 (17.6%) had SVI identified after surgery. Review of T2-weighted MR images alone resulted in high specificity (93.1% and 93.6%, for radiologists A and B, respectively) and high negative predictive value (94.8% and 94.0%) but moderate sensitivity (59% and 52%) and positive predictive value (52% and 50%). Review of T2-weighted and DW MR images significantly improved specificity (96.6% [P = .02] and 98.3% [P = .003]) and positive predictive value (70% [P < .05] and 79% [P < .05]) without significantly improving AUC. Additional review of DCE MR images did not yield further incremental improvement.Additional review of DW MR images improves specificity and positive predictive value in SVI detection compared with reviewing T2-weighted images alone. Addition of DCE MR images to this combination, however, does not provide incremental value for diagnosis of SVI.",
        "To estimate the long-term (29-year) effect of mammographic screening on breast cancer mortality in terms of both relative and absolute effects.This study was carried out under the auspices of the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare. The board determined that, because randomization was at a community level and was to invitation to screening, informed verbal consent could be given by the participants when they attended the screening examination. A total of 133 065 women aged 40-74 years residing in two Swedish counties were randomized into a group invited to mammographic screening and a control group receiving usual care. Case status and cause of death were determined by the local trial end point committees and, independently, by an external committee. Mortality analysis was performed by using negative binomial regression.There was a highly significant reduction in breast cancer mortality in women invited to screening according to both local end point committee data (relative risk [RR] = 0.69; 95% confidence interval: 0.56, 0.84; P < .0001) and consensus data (RR = 0.73; 95% confidence interval: 0.59, 0.89; P = .002). At 29 years of follow-up, the number of women needed to undergo screening for 7 years to prevent one breast cancer death was 414 according to local data and 519 according to consensus data. Most prevented breast cancer deaths would have occurred (in the absence of screening) after the first 10 years of follow-up.Invitation to mammographic screening results in a highly significant decrease in breast cancer-specific mortality. Evaluation of the full impact of screening, in particular estimates of absolute benefit and number needed to screen, requires follow-up times exceeding 20 years because the observed number of breast cancer deaths prevented increases with increasing time of follow-up.",
        "To estimate the risk of nerve injuries and assess outcomes after sodium tetradecyl sulfate (STS) sclerotherapy of venous malformations (VMs) in children.Sclerotherapy is the treatment of choice for most VMs, but all sclerotherapy agents are associated with the risk of complications. Neuropathy is considered a rare but potentially serious complication of venous sclerotherapy. The institutional review board waived ethical approval for this retrospective review, in which 647 sclerotherapy procedures were performed in 204 patients (104 female and 100 male patients; mean age, 9 years 6 months [range, 6 months to 17 years 11 months]) as treatment for symptomatic VMs. Technical and clinical success of the treatment was evaluated. Complications were reviewed with a particular focus on nerve injury. Informed consent, specifying the risk of neuropathy, as well as pain, swelling, infection, risks of anesthesia, skin injury, nonresolution or worsening of symptoms, and possible need for further or multiple procedures, was obtained for all patients. Standard sclerotherapy techniques were used. Technical details of all procedures were recorded prospectively. Follow-up included immediate postprocedural assessment and outpatient clinic review. All nerve injuries were recorded. Patients were monitored and treated according to clinical need. Confidence intervals were calculated by using the Wilson method, without correction for continuity.Treatment was technically successful in 197 of 204 patients (96.6%), and clinical success was achieved in 174 of 204 (85.3%). Thirty-seven of the 647 procedures (5.7%) resulted in a complication, including 11 cases of excessive swelling, nine cases of skin injury, two patients with infection, and two with pain. Motor and/or sensory nerve injuries occurred after seven procedures (1.1%). Five of the seven children had undergone at least one previous sclerotherapy procedure. Neuropathy resolved spontaneously in four patients and partially recovered in three, of whom two underwent surgery. Surgery included debridement of necrotic tissue, carpal tunnel decompression, and external neurolysis.Nerve injury is an unusual but not rare complication of STS sclerotherapy. A degree of recovery, which may be complete, can be expected in most patients.",
        "To identify predictors of clinically important abnormal findings in computed tomography (CT) images of the head among emergency department (ED) patients without a history of trauma.Approval was obtained from the institutional research ethics board, and informed consent from patients was not required. This study was a retrospective review of consecutive unenhanced head CT examinations in patients aged 18 years or older who did not have trauma or known intracranial pathologic processes in ED from January 2004 through June 2006. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of clinically important abnormal CT findings in the derivation cohort (CT examinations from January 1, 2004, through August 15, 2005), and the reproducibility of findings in a validation cohort (all subsequent CT scans through to June 30, 2006) was assessed. The strength of association of each variable was expressed with clinically important abnormal CT findings as adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).Of 29 469 consecutive head CT images performed at a single institution between January 1, 2004, and June 30, 2006, 3967 were eligible for this study. Of the CT images in these patients, 548 (13.8%) revealed clinically important abnormalities. Six independent clinical predictors of important abnormal findings on head CT were identified: age (adjusted OR per 10-year increase: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.28), focal neurologic deficit (adjusted OR: 5.39; 95% CI: 3.90, 7.47), altered mental status (adjusted OR: 2.32; 95% CI: 1.66, 3.25), history of malignancy (adjusted OR: 4.11; 95% CI: 2.28, 7.42), nausea and/or vomiting (adjusted OR: 2.22; 95% CI: 1.14, 4.33), and derangements in coagulation profile (adjusted OR: 1.91; 95% CI: 1.07, 3.41).This study identified several potential clinical predictors of abnormal head CT findings in ED patients who did not sustain trauma. Prospective validation of a clinical prediction rule in this population is warranted.",
        "To identify nationwide trends and factors associated with the use of computed tomography (CT) in the emergency department (ED).This study was exempt from institutional review board approval. Data from the 1995-2007 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey were used to evaluate the numbers and percentages of ED visits associated with CT. A mean of 30 044 visits were sampled each year. Data were also subcategorized according to multiple patient and hospital characteristics. The Rao-Scott \u03c7(2) test was performed to determine whether CT use was similar across subpopulations. Data were evaluated according to exponential and logistic growth models.From 1995 to 2007, the number of ED visits that included a CT examination increased from 2.7 million to 16.2 million, constituting a 5.9-fold increase and a compound annual growth rate of 16.0%. The percentage of visits associated with CT increased from 2.8% to 13.9%, constituting a 4.9-fold increase and a compound annual growth rate of 14.2%. The exponential growth model provided the best fit for the trend in CT use. CT use was greater in older patients, white patients, patients admitted to the hospital, and patients at facilities in metropolitan regions. By the end of the study period, the top chief complaints among those who underwent CT were abdominal pain, headache, and chest pain. The percentage of patient visits associated with CT for all evaluated chief complaints increased-most substantially among those who underwent CT for flank, abdominal, or chest pain.Use of CT has increased at a higher rate in the ED than in other settings. The overall use of CT had not begun to taper by 2007.",
        "To investigate the differences in the extracranial venous system in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and healthy control (HC) subjects by using magnetic resonance (MR) venography.This HIPAA-compliant, prospective study was approved by the local institutional review board, and all participants gave informed consent. Fifty-seven patients, 41 (72%) with relapsing-remitting MS and 16 (28%) with secondary-progressive MS, and 21 HC subjects were imaged with a 3-T MR unit by using two-dimensional (2D) time-of-flight (TOF) and three-dimensional (3D) time-resolved imaging of contrast kinetics (TRICKS) sequences. In addition, six MS patients and six HC subjects underwent two sequential MR venographic examinations during 1 week to test image-reimage reproducibility. The morphologic features of internal jugular vein flow were classified as absent, pinpoint, flattened, crescentic, or ellipsoidal flow. Only absent and pinpoint flow were considered abnormal. The flow of the vertebral veins was classified as absent or present. The prominence of collateral neck veins and venous asymmetries between the left and right sides were assessed. Differences among groups were tested with a two-tailed Mann-Whitney two-sample rank-sum test.No significant differences in morphologic features of flow in the internal jugular veins and vertebral veins were found between MS patients and HC subjects in any of the examined MR venographic parameters. No differences in asymmetry or prominence were found between MS patients and HC subjects. There was modest agreement (\u03ba = 0.67) between 2D TOF and 3D TRICKS sequences. Image-reimage reproducibility showed modest agreement (\u03ba = 0.66) for 2D TOF and low agreement for 3D TRICKS (\u03ba = 0.33).No significant differences in the extracranial venous systems between MS patients and HC subjects were detected by using MR venography. Standardized guidelines are needed to define parameters for the presence of venous anomalies.",
        "Purpose To determine whether flow velocity can be measured by using projection data from computed tomographic (CT) scans obtained during contrast material injection in a phantom model. Materials and Methods The authors constructed a 12.7-mm-diameter single-channel flow phantom with constant water flow velocity settings of 25.3, 43.9, and 70.5 cm/sec. For each flow velocity, serial axial scans were obtained with 16-section multidetector CT while a 10-mL bolus of contrast material was injected upstream of the imaging plane. For each bolus injection, the CT projection data from the scan with the sharpest increase in magnitude of detected contrast material was used for flow velocity measurements. Flow velocity was calculated as the ratio of distance between CT detector rows and the corresponding time lag in the contrast enhancement curves and was correlated with the reference velocities. Five separate contrast material injections and CT measurements were made for each flow velocity setting. Results The correlation coefficient between the CT measurements of flow velocity and the reference measurements was 0.98 (P < .05). The mean CT measurements of flow velocity were 34.2, 53.9, and 80.8 cm/sec for slow, moderate, and fast velocity settings, respectively, overestimating the corresponding actual flow velocities by 26%, 18%, and 13% and showing precision values (coefficients of variation) of 5.2%, 3.7%, and 6.6%. Conclusion Flow velocity can be measured from row-to-row multidetector CT projectional data obtained during a single gantry revolution as a bolus of contrast material flows through a vascular phantom. With further development, this novel technique could potentially provide physiologic information to complement the anatomic CT angiographic findings of vascular disease. \u00a9 RSNA, 2011",
        "Purpose To evaluate the incremental value of using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in addition to T2-weighted imaging for the detection of prostate cancer in the transition zone and the assessment of tumor aggressiveness. Materials and Methods This retrospective HIPAA-compliant institutional review board\u2013approved study included 156 consecutive patients (median age, 59.2 years) who underwent MR imaging before radical prostatectomy. Two readers who were blinded to patient data independently recorded their levels of suspicion on a five-point scale of the presence of transition zone tumors on the basis of T2-weighted imaging alone and then, 4 weeks later, diffusion-weighted imaging and T2-weighted imaging together. Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) were measured in transition zone cancers and glandular and stromal benign prostatic hyperplasia. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were used to evaluate detection accuracy, and generalized linear models were used to test ADC differences between benign and malignant prostate regions. Whole-mount step-section histopathologic examination was the reference standard. Results In overall tumor detection, addition of diffusion-weighted imaging to T2-weighted imaging improved the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for readers 1 and 2 from 0.60 and 0.60 to 0.75 and 0.71, respectively, at the patient level (P = .004 for reader 1 and P = .027 for reader 2) and from 0.64 and 0.63 to 0.73 and 0.68, respectively, at the sextant level (P = .001 for reader 1 and P = .100 for reader 2). Least squares mean ADCs (\u00d7 10\u22123 mm2/sec) in glandular and stromal benign prostatic hyperplasia were 1.44 and 1.09, respectively. Mean ADCs were inversely associated with tumor Gleason scores (1.10, 0.98, 0.87, and 0.75 for Gleason scores of 3 + 3, 3 + 4, 4 + 3, and \u2265 4 + 4, respectively). Conclusion Use of diffusion-weighted imaging in addition to T2-weighted imaging improved detection of prostate cancer in the transition zone, and tumor ADCs were inversely associated with tumor Gleason scores in the transition zone. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "To identify computed tomographic (CT) coronary indexes independently associated with a fractional flow reserve (FFR) of 0.8 or less, to derive a score that combines CT indexes most predictive of an FFR of 0.8 or less, and to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the score in predicting an FFR of 0.8 or less.This retrospective study had institutional review board approval and waiver of the need to obtain informed consent. Consecutive patients who underwent CT coronary angiography and FFR assessment with one or more discrete lesion(s) of intermediate (30%-70%) severity at CT were included. Quantitative CT measurements were performed by using dedicated software. The CT indexes evaluated included the following: plaque burden, minimal luminal area and diameter, stenosis diameter, area of stenosis, lesion length, remodeling index, plaque morphology, calcification severity, and the Alberta Provincial Project for Outcome Assessment in Coronary Heart Disease (APPROACH) score, which approximates the size of the myocardium subtended by a lesion. By using covariates independently associated with an FFR of 0.8 or less, a score was determined on the basis of modified Akaike information criteria, and the C statistics of individual and combined indexes were compared.Eighty-five patients (mean age, 64.2 years; range, 48-88 years; 65.9% men; 124 lesions; 38 lesions with an FFR \u2264 0.8) were included. Area of stenosis, lesion length, and APPROACH score were the strongest predictors of an FFR of 0.8 or less and were used to derive the ASLA score. The optimism-adjusted Harrell C statistic for the combined score was 0.82, which was superior to that for area of stenosis (0.74), lesion length (0.75), and the APPROACH score (0.71) (P < .001 for trend). The corresponding incremental discrimination improvement indexes were 0.17, 0.11, and 0.19, respectively (P < .001 for all), suggesting that the score improves reclassification compared with any one angiographic index. The average time required for score derivation was 102.6 seconds.The ASLA score, which accounts for CT-derived area of stenosis, lesion length, and APPROACH score, may conveniently improve the prediction, beyond individual indexes, of functionally significant intermediate coronary lesions.",
        "To retrospectively review diagnostic mammography in women diagnosed with breast cancer who previously had mantle field radiation therapy for Hodgkin disease in England and Wales over a period of 30 years.From a national cohort study of 5002 women treated with supradiaphragmatic radiation therapy when they were younger than 36 years (mean, 22.1 years) during 1956-2003, 392 patients developed breast cancer. With ethics committee approval and informed consent, mammograms were obtained that showed 230 tumors in 222 (56.6%) patients from 95 hospitals, and the size and appearance of each carcinoma was recorded by two breast radiologists. Comparison was made with a historical report of more than 1000 general-population breast cancers by using Pearson \u03c7(2) test.Thirty-eight tumors were occult on mammograms. Mean tumor maximum diameter was 12.3 mm (n = 81) on oblique view. The quadrant distribution of the tumors was significantly different (P < .001) from the historic controls, and chest radiation therapy patients had a greater proportion of tumors in the upper outer (66.9% [107 of 160] vs 48.7% [385 of 784]) and, to a lesser extent, lower inner (10.6% [17 of 160] vs 7.8% [61 of 784]) quadrants. The dominant radiologic feature was of an irregular mass (56.8% [109 of 192]) followed by microcalcifications (25.0% [48 of 192]).This study suggests that in patients who previously underwent mantle radiation therapy for Hodgkin disease, breast cancers are more commonly seen within the upper outer quadrants than are cancers in the general population. Poorly defined masses were the most common appearance.",
        "Purpose To assess the ability of noninvasive vascular elastography (NIVE) to help characterize endoleaks and thrombus organization in a canine model of abdominal aortic aneurysm after endovascular aneurysm repair with stent-grafts, in comparison with computed tomography (CT) and pathologic examination findings. Materials and Methods All protocols were approved by the Animal Care Committee in accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council of Animal Care. Stent-grafts were implanted in a group of 18 dogs with aneurysms created in the abdominal aorta. Type I endoleak was created in four aneurysms; type II endoleak, in 13 aneurysms; and no endoleak, in one aneurysm. Doppler ultrasonography and NIVE examinations were performed at baseline and at 1-week, 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up. Angiography, CT, and macroscopic tissue examination were performed at sacrifice. Strain values were computed by using the Lagrangian speckle model estimator. Areas of endoleak, solid organized thrombus, and fresh thrombus were identified and segmented by comparing the results of CT and macroscopic tissue examination. Strain values were compared by using the Wilcoxon rank-sum and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results All stent-grafts were successfully deployed, and endoleaks were clearly depicted in the last follow-up elastography examinations. Maximal axial strains over consecutive heart cycles in endoleak, organized thrombus, and fresh thrombus areas were 0.78% \u00b1 0.22, 0.23% \u00b1 0.02, 0.10% \u00b1 0.04, respectively. Strain values were significantly different between endoleak and organized or fresh thrombus areas (P < .000) and between organized and fresh thrombus areas (P < .0002). No correlation was found between strain values and type of endoleak, sac pressure, endoleak size, and aneurysm size. Conclusion NIVE may be able to help characterize endoleak and thrombus organization, regardless of the size, pressure, and type of endoleak. \u00a9 RSNA, 2015",
        "Purpose To examine time trends in radiologists\u2019 interpretive performance at screening mammography between 1996 and 2004. Materials and Methods All study procedures were institutional review board approved and HIPAA compliant. Data were collected on subsequent screening mammograms obtained from 1996 to 2004 in women aged 40\u201379 years who were followed up for 1 year for breast cancer. Recall rate, sensitivity, and specificity were examined annually. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) and random-effects models were used to test for linear trend. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), tumor histologic findings, and size of the largest dimension or diameter of the tumor were also examined. Results Data on 2 542 049 subsequent screening mammograms and 12 498 cancers diagnosed in the follow-up period were included in this study. Recall rate increased from 6.7% to 8.6%, sensitivity increased from 71.4% to 83.8%, and specificity decreased from 93.6% to 91.7%. In GEE models, adjusted odds ratios per calendar year were 1.04 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02, 1.05) for recall rate, 1.09 (95% CI: 1.07. 1.12) for sensitivity, and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.95, 0.98) for specificity (P < .001 for all). Random-effects model results were similar. The AUC increased over time: 0.869 (95% CI: 0.861, 0.877) for 1996\u20131998, 0.884 (95% CI: 0.879, 0.890) for 1999\u20132001, and 0.891 (95% CI: 0.885, 0.896) for 2002\u20132004 (P < .001). Tumor histologic findings and size remained constant. Conclusion Recall rate and sensitivity for screening mammograms increased, whereas specificity decreased from 1996 to 2004 among women with a prior mammogram. This trend remained after accounting for risk factors. The net effect was an improvement in overall discrimination, a measure of the probability that a mammogram with cancer in the follow-up period has a higher Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System assessment category than does a mammogram without cancer in the follow-up period. \u00a9 RSNA, 2010",
        "Purpose To investigate the impact of radiation dose on breast density estimation in digital mammography. Materials and Methods With institutional review board approval and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliance under waiver of consent, a cohort of women from the American College of Radiology Imaging Network Pennsylvania 4006 trial was retrospectively analyzed. All patients underwent breast screening with a combination of dose protocols, including standard full-field digital mammography, low-dose digital mammography, and digital breast tomosynthesis. A total of 5832 images from 486 women were analyzed with previously validated, fully automated software for quantitative estimation of density. Clinical Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) density assessment results were also available from the trial reports. The influence of image acquisition radiation dose on quantitative breast density estimation was investigated with analysis of variance and linear regression. Pairwise comparisons of density estimations at different dose levels were performed with Student t test. Agreement of estimation was evaluated with quartile-weighted Cohen kappa values and Bland-Altman limits of agreement. Results Radiation dose of image acquisition did not significantly affect quantitative density measurements (analysis of variance, P = .37 to P = .75), with percent density demonstrating a high overall correlation between protocols (r = 0.88-0.95; weighted \u03ba = 0.83-0.90). However, differences in breast percent density (1.04% and 3.84%, P < .05) were observed within high BI-RADS density categories, although they were significantly correlated across the different acquisition dose levels (r = 0.76-0.92, P < .05). Conclusion Precision and reproducibility of automated breast density measurements with digital mammography are not substantially affected by variations in radiation dose; thus, the use of low-dose techniques for the purpose of density estimation may be feasible.

        "BACKGROUND\r\nHydrocephalus is a condition in which excess fluid accumulates in the brain resulting in dilatation of the ventricles. The prognosis of hydrocephalus depends on the cause and severity of the condition. Computed tomography (CT) is one of the imaging modalities used for diagnosis and evaluation of treatment options as well as for follow up and monitoring of the patients.\r\nAIM AND OBJECTIVES\r\nThis study is aimed at documenting CT findings of hydrocephalus in children at Usmanu Danfodiyo University Teaching Hospital (UDUTH) Sokoto. Specific objectives were to determine the common causes of hydrocephalus, compare the incidence of congenital and acquired hydrocephalus and determine the degree of cerebral mantle thickness in different forms of hydrocephalus in children.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was a four year (January 2009 \u2013 December 2013) retrospective study of 100 consecutive children with clinical and/or Computarized Tomographic (CT) diagnosis of hydrocephalus who had CT scan at the Radiology Department of UDUTH Sokoto, North Western Nigeria.\r\nData and the images were retrieved from the departmental archives andpatient\u2019s case folders. These data regarding the demographics of patients, clinical history and examination, cranial CT findings and radiological measurements namely cerebral mantle thickness, frontal horn distance and internal skull diameter were entered into the proforma. Data was analyzed using SPSS statistical software package version 20. Analysis of quantitative and qualitative data was made using frequency, mean and standard deviation followed by inferential statistics using Chi square and independent t test to determine associations in categorical and continuous variables respectively.RESULTS\r\nThe age range of patients was from 5 days to 14 years. The male/female ratio was 1.6:1. Congenital hydrocephalus accounted for 54% while acquired hydrocephalus occured in 46%. Non communicating hydrocephalus was the predominant form of hydrocephalus accounting for 59% while communicating hydrocephalus occured in 41% of patients. Aqueductal stenosis (32%) was the commonest cause of hydrocephalus followed by post meningitic hydrocephalus (22%) and intracranial tumours (16%) respectively. The mean cerebral mantle thickness was 17.5mm and 16.6mm for the right and left side respectively with10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore thinning recorded in non communicating hydrocephalus than communicating hydrocephalus.CONCLUSIONThis study shows that congenital hydrocephalus is the predominant type in the study population. Aqueductal stenosis was the commonest cause of hydrocephalus.",
        "To investigate the ability of contrast material-enhanced ultrasonography (US) to help diagnose obstruction of middle hepatic venous (MHV) tributaries soon after living-donor liver transplantation with modified right lobe grafts.The institutional review board approved the study and waived requirement for informed consent. Sixty-five consecutive patients (48 men, 17 women; mean age, 52.8 years; range, 33-69 years) who underwent living-donor liver transplantation with modified right lobe grafts between February and May 2009 were included. All patients underwent contrast-enhanced US and Doppler US on postoperative day 1 and underwent computed tomography (CT) within 7 days after US. At contrast-enhanced US, parenchymal enhancement patterns in the territory of each MHV tributary during arterial and portal venous phases were evaluated. With use of most frequent enhancement patterns in patients with obstruction at MHV tributaries as a criterion, diagnostic performance of contrast-enhanced US was compared with that of Doppler US for diagnosis of obstruction at MHV tributaries; CT was the reference standard. Generalized estimating equations were used to adjust for data clustering.Of 148 MHV tributaries in 65 patients, 36 (24.3%) in 31 patients were diagnosed as obstructed at CT. With arterial high echogenicity or portal low echogenicity used as a criterion for hepatic venous obstruction, contrast-enhanced US had sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 91% (33 of 36), 97% (109 of 112), and 95% (142 of 148), respectively, whereas Doppler US had values of 83% (30 of 36), 86% (97 of 112), and 85% (127 of 148), respectively. Contrast-enhanced US was significantly more specific and accurate than Doppler US for diagnosis of obstruction at MHV tributaries (P=.024 and .01, respectively). Arterial high echogenicity was noted only in the hepatic venous obstruction group.Contrast-enhanced US can help accurately assess hepatic venous obstruction at MHV tributaries after living-donor liver transplantation with a modified right lobe graft. Contrast-enhanced US was significantly more specific than Doppler US, with arterial hyperenhancement in the affected area being specific to hepatic venous obstruction.",
        "To assess the reproducibility and the distribution of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) and diffusion-tensor (DT) imaging parameters in healthy renal cortex and medulla at baseline and after hydration or furosemide challenges.Using an institutional review board-approved HIPAA-compliant protocol with written informed consent, IVIM and DT imaging were performed at 3 T in 10 volunteers before and after water loading or furosemide administration. IVIM (apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC], tissue diffusivity [D(t)], perfusion fraction [f(p)], pseudodiffusivity [D(p)]) and DT (mean diffusivity [MD], fractional anisotropy [FA], eigenvalues [\u03bb(i)]) imaging parameters and urine output from serial bladder volumes were calculated. (a)Reproducibility was quantified with coefficient of variation, intraclass correlation coefficient, and Bland-Altman limits of agreement; (b) contrast and challenge response were quantified with analysis of variance; and (c) Pearson correlations were quantified with urine output.Good reproducibility was found for ADC, D(t), MD, FA, and \u03bb(i) (average coefficient of variation, 3.7% [cortex] and 5.0% [medulla]), and moderate reproducibility was found for D(p), f(p), and f(p) \u00b7 D(p) (average coefficient of variation, 18.7% [cortex] and 25.9% [medulla]). Baseline cortical diffusivities significantly exceeded medullary values except D(p), for which medullary values significantly exceeded cortical values, and \u03bb(1,) which showed no contrast. ADC, D(t), MD, and \u03bb(i) increased significantly for both challenges. Medullary diffusivity increases were dominated by transverse diffusion (1.72 \u00b1 0.09 [baseline] to 1.79 \u00b1 0.10 [hydration] \u03bcm(2)/msec, P = .0059; or 1.86 \u00b1 0.07 [furosemide] \u03bcm(2)/msec, P = .0094). Urine output correlated with cortical ADC with furosemide (r = 0.7, P = .034) and with medullary \u03bb(1) (r = 0.83, P = .0418), \u03bb(2) (r = 0.85, P = .0301), and MD (r = 0.82, P = .045) with hydration.Diffusion MR metrics are sensitive to flow changes in kidney induced by diuretic challenges. The results of this study suggest that vascular flow, tubular dilation, water reabsorption, and intratubular flow all play important roles in diffusion-weighted imaging contrast.",
        "To prospectively assess the diagnostic performance of diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the detection of pelvic lymph node metastases in patients with prostate and/or bladder cancer staged as N0 with preoperative cross-sectional imaging.This study was approved by an independent ethics committee. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Patients with no enlarged lymph nodes on preoperative cross-sectional images who were scheduled for radical resection of the primary tumor and extended pelvic lymph node dissection were enrolled. All patients were examined with a 3-T MR unit, and examinations included conventional and DW MR imaging of the entire pelvis. Image analysis was performed by three independent readers blinded to any clinical information. Metastases were diagnosed on the basis of high signal intensity on high b value DW MR images and morphologic features (shape, border). Histopathologic examination served as the standard of reference. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated, and bias-corrected 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained with the bootstrap method. The Fleiss and Cohen \u03ba and median test were applied for statistical analyses.A total of 4846 lymph nodes were resected in 120 patients. Eighty-eight lymph node metastases were found in 33 of 120 patients (27.5%). Short-axis diameter of these metastases was less than or equal to 3 mm in 68, more than 3 mm to 5 mm in 13, more than 5 mm to 8 mm in five; and more than 8 mm in two. On a per-patient level, the three readers correctly detected metastases in 26 (79%; 95% CI: 64%, 91%), 21 (64%; 95% CI: 45%, 79%), and 25 (76%; 95% CI: 60%, 90%) of the 33 patients with metastases, with respective specificities of 85% (95% CI: 78%, 92%), 79% (95% CI: 70%, 88%), and 84% (95% CI: 76%, 92%). Analyzed according to hemipelvis, lymph node metastases were detected with histopathologic examination in 44 of 240 pelvic sides (18%); the three readers correctly detected these on DW MR images in 26 (59%; 95% CI: 45%, 73%), 19 (43%; 95% CI: 27%, 57%), and 28 (64%; 95% CI: 47%, 78%) of the 44 cases.DW MR imaging enables noninvasive detection of small lymph node metastases in normal-sized nodes in a substantial percentage of patients with prostate and bladder cancer diagnosed as N0 with conventional cross-sectional imaging techniques.",
        "To identify the prognostic value and staging categories of masticator space involvement in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) as determined with anatomic criteria (\"anatomic masticator space involvement\") to determine whether it is necessary for the masticator space described with criteria of the American Joint Committee on Cancer to exclude the medial and lateral pterygoid muscles.This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and the requirement to obtain informed consent was waived. NPC was diagnosed in 924 patients with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and medical records and imaging studies were retrospectively analyzed. The overall survival, local relapse-free survival, and distant metastasis-free survival of these patients were analyzed by using the Kaplan-Meier method; differences were compared by using the log-rank test.The frequency of anatomic masticator space involvement was 19.7% (182 of 924 patients). With use of multivariate analysis, anatomic masticator space involvement was identified as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (P = .02). In addition, anatomic masticator space involvement was associated with a marginally significant decrease in local relapse-free survival (P = .05); however, it had no effect on distant metastasis-free survival. There were no statistically significant differences between different degrees of anatomic masticator space involvement with regard to overall survival and local relapse-free survival in NPC (P = .34 and P = .54, respectively) or between T3 or T4 disease and anatomic masticator space involvement with regard to overall survival and local relapse-free survival (P = .63 and P = .44, respectively).Anatomic masticator space involvement affects the overall survival and local relapse-free survival of patients with NPC. When masticator space involvement includes the medial and lateral pterygoid muscles, the disease should be classified as stage T4.",
        "To predict cardiovascular disease (CVD) in a clinical care population by using prevalent subclinical ancillary aortic findings detected on chest computed tomographic (CT) images.The study was approved by the medical ethics committee of the primary participating facility and the institutional review boards of all other participating centers. From a total of 6975 patients who underwent diagnostic contrast material-enhanced chest CT for noncardiovascular indications, a representative sample population of 817 patients plus 347 patients who experienced a cardiovascular event during a mean follow-up period of 17 months were assigned visual scores for ancillary aortic abnormalities--on a scale of 0-8 for calcifications, a scale of 0-4 for plaques, a scale of 0-4 for irregularities, and a scale of 0-1 for elongation. Four Cox proportional hazard models incorporating different sum scores for the aortic abnormalities plus age, sex, and chest CT indication were compared for discrimination and calibration. The prediction model that performed best was chosen and externally validated.Each aortic abnormality was highly predictive, and all models performed well (c index range, 0.70-0.72; goodness-of-fit P value range, .45-.76). The prediction model incorporating the sum score for aortic calcifications was chosen owing to its good performance (c index, 0.72; goodness-of-fit P = .47) and its applicability to nonenhanced CT scanning. Validation of this model in an external data set also revealed good performance (c index, 0.71; goodness-of-fit P = .25; sensitivity, 46%; specificity, 76%).A derived prediction model incorporating ancillary aortic findings detected on routine diagnostic CT images complements established risk scores and may help to identify patients at high risk for CVD. Timely application of preventative measures may ultimately reduce the number or severity of CVD events.",
        "Purpose To retrospectively identify the relationship between epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status, predominant histologic subtype, and computed tomographic (CT) characteristics in surgically resected lung adenocarcinomas in a cohort of Asian patients. materials and Methods This study was approved by the institutional review board, with waiver of informed consent. Preoperative chest CT findings were retrospectively evaluated in 385 surgically resected lung adenocarcinomas. A total of 30 CT descriptors were assessed. EGFR mutations at exons 18\u201321 were determined by using the amplification refractory mutation system. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent factors of harboring EGFR mutation status. The final model was selected by using the backward elimination method, and two areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) were compared with the nonparametric approach of DeLong, DeLong, and Clarke-Pearson. Results EGFR mutations were found in 168 (43.6%) of 385 patients. Mutations were found more frequently in (a) female patients (P < .001); (b)those who had never smoked (P < .001); (c)those with lepidic predominant adenocarcinomas (P = .001) or intermediate pathologic grade (P < .001); (e) smaller tumors (P < .001); (f)tumors with spiculation (P = .019), ground-glass opacity (GGO) or mixed GGO (P < .001), air bronchogram (P = .006), bubblelike lucency (P < .001), vascular convergence (P = .024), thickened adjacent bronchovascular bundles (P = .027), or pleural retraction (P < .001); and (g) tumors without pleural attachment (P = .004), a well-defined margin (P = .010), marked heterogeneous enhancement (P = .001), severe peripheral emphysema (P = .002), severe peripheral fibrosis (P = .013), or lymphadenopathy (P = .028). The most important and significantly independent prognostic factors of harboring EGFR-activating mutation for the model with both clinical variables and CT features were those who had never smoked and those with smaller tumors, bubblelike lucency, homogeneous enhancement, or pleural retraction when adjusting for histologic subtype, pathologic grade, or thickened adjacent bronchovascular bundles. ROC curve analysis showed that use of clinical variables combined with CT features (area under the ROC curve = 0.778) was superior to use of clinical variables alone (area under the ROC curve = 0.690). Conclusion CT imaging features of lung adenocarcinomas in combination with clinical variables can be used to prognosticate EGFR mutation status better than use of clinical variables alone. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To assess the feasibility of hybrid imaging of the heart with fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) on an integrated 3-T positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance (MR) imaging system.The present study was approved by the local institutional review board. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients before imaging. Twenty consecutive patients with myocardial infarction (n = 20) underwent cardiac PET/MR imaging examination. Ten patients underwent additional cardiac PET/computed tomography (CT) before PET/MR. Two-dimensional half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin-echo sequences, balanced steady-state free precession cine sequences, two-dimensional turbo inversion-recovery magnitude T2-weighted sequences, and late gadolinium-enhanced (LGE) segmented two-dimensional inversion-recovery turbo fast low-angle shot sequences were performed. According to the 17-segment model, PET tracer uptake, wall motion, and late gadolinium enhancement were visually assessed for each segment on a binary scale, and categorical intermethod agreement was calculated by using the Cohen \u03ba. The maximum standardized uptake value was measured in corresponding myocardial locations on PET/CT and PET/MR images.Agreement was substantial over all patients and segments between PET and LGE images (\u03ba = 0.76) and between PET and cine images (\u03ba = 0.78). In 306 segments, 97 (32%) were rated as infarcted on PET images, compared with 93 (30%) rated as infarcted on LGE images and with 90 (29%) rated as infarcted on cine images. In a subgroup of patients (n = 10) with an additional PET/CT scan, no significant difference in myocardial tracer uptake between PET/CT and PET/MR images was found (paired t test, P = .95).Cardiac PET/MR imaging with FDG is feasible and may add complementary information in patients with ischemic heart disease.",
        "To measure the activity of individual raphe nuclei with fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and carbon 11 ((11)C) 3-amino-4-(2-dimethylaminomethylphenylthio) benzonitrile (DASB) imaging using a brain positron emission tomography(PET)/magnetic resonance (MR) imaging fusion system.The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Gil Medical Center, and all volunteers provided written informed consent. FDG PET, (11)C-DASB PET, and T2*-weighted MR images from seven healthy volunteers were acquired by using a PET/MR imaging fusion system. The standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) of FDG (FDG-SUVR) and nondisplaceable binding potential (BPnd) of (11)C-DASB (DASB-BPnd) were determined for each raphe nucleus. A Pearson correlation analysis was performed to show the correlation between FDG-SUVR and DASB-BPnd for the raphe nuclei.Each raphe nucleus could be distinguished in both FDG (identifiability ratio, 0.86; \u03ba = 0.77) and (11)C-DASB (identifiability ratio, 0.89; \u03ba = 0.72) images. The mean values of DASB-BPnd for each raphe nucleus from dorsal to caudal direction were 6.08 (raphe nucleus 1), 5.93 (raphe nucleus 2), 3.86 (raphe nucleus 3), 3.18 (raphe nucleus 4), and 2.74 (raphe nucleus 5); the mean FDG-SUVR values were 1.00 (raphe nucleus 1), 1.00 (raphe nucleus 2), 0.87 (raphe nucleus 3), 0.94 (raphe nucleus 4), and 0.90 (raphe nucleus 5). FDG-SUVR and DASB-BPnd for the raphe nuclei were significantly correlated (r = 0.506, P = .002).Serotonergic activity, both glucose metabolism and transporter binding potential of raphe nuclei, were measured with a brain-dedicated PET/MR imaging system and showed a significant correlation.",
        "To use large-scale network (LSN) analysis to classify subjects with Alzheimer disease (AD), those with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and cognitively normal (CN) subjects.The study was conducted with institutional review board approval and was in compliance with HIPAA regulations. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was used to acquire the voxelwise time series in 55 subjects with clinically diagnosed AD (n = 20), aMCI (n =15), and normal cognitive function (n = 20). The brains were divided into 116 regions of interest (ROIs). The Pearson product moment correlation coefficients of pairwise ROIs were used to classify these subjects. Error estimation of the classifications was performed with the leave-one-out cross-validation method. Linear regression analysis was performed to analyze the relationship between changes in network connectivity strengths and behavioral scores.The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) yielded 87% classification power, 85% sensitivity, and 80% specificity between the AD group and the non-AD group (subjects with aMCI and CN subjects) in the first-step classification. For differentiation between subjects with aMCI and CN subjects, AUC was 95%; sensitivity, 93%; and specificity, 90%. The decreased network indexes were significantly correlated with the Mini-Mental State Examination score in all tested subjects. Similarly, changes in network indexes significantly correlated with Rey Auditory Verbal Leaning Test delayed recall scores in subjects with aMCI and CN subjects.LSN analysis revealed that interconnectivity patterns of brain regions can be used to classify subjects with AD, those with aMCI, and CN subjects. In addition, the altered connectivity networks were significantly correlated with the results of cognitive tests.",
        "To investigate the imaging features of hypovascular hypointense nodules on hepatobiliary phase gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) images in patients with cirrhosis that may be associated with progression to hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).The institutional review board approved this retrospective study and waived informed patient consent. This study included 135 patients with a diagnosis of hepatitis B-induced liver cirrhosis and 214 hypovascular hypointense nodules on hepatobiliary phase gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR images. MR images were analyzed with respect to nodule size, degree of hypointensity at hepatobiliary phase (four grades), presence of fat, and signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted (DW) images. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to identify variables that are associated with developing hypervascular HCC.On follow-up MR images, 139 nodules (65.0%) had no evidence of HCC (mean follow-up, 522 days) (group 1), but 75 (35.0%) became hypervascular HCC (mean follow-up, 388 days) (group 2). Univariable Cox analysis revealed that the degree of hypointensity on hepatobiliary phase images (P=.044 and .001) and hyperintensity on T2-weighted and DW images (P=.001 and .0001) was significantly related to the development of hypervascular HCC. According to the multivariable Cox analysis, no other variable significantly adjusted the model once hyperintensity at initial DW imaging was already included as an associated variable, (hazard ratio, 7.44; 95% confidence interval: 4.28, 12.94; P=.0001).Hyperintensity on DW images in hypovascular hypointense nodules on hepatobiliary phase gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR images in patients with cirrhosis is strongly associated with progression to hypervascular HCC.",
        "Photoacoustic imaging imparts the ability to distinguish materials according to their differences in optical absorption (ie, their colors) with the high spatial and temporal resolution of ultrasonography (US). Experiments in rats demonstrate the advantages this approach would have in the clinically important application of percutaneous sentinel node biopsy. The incorporation of the technique in a conventional US imaging system gives promise of rapid translation to clinical use.",
        "To evaluate the feasibility of using an internally cooled directional electrode (ICDE) to create sufficient directional ablation in the desired area and to investigate whether use of the ICDE reduces thermal injury to the adjacent organs.The animal care and use committee approved this animal study. In ex vivo studies of bovine livers and colons, temperature was measured in both ablation and nonablation directions with the ICDE, temperature at the liver-colon interface and the presence of burns on the colon were evaluated with each ICDE and internally cooled conventional electrode (ICCE), and the ablation area with the use of three ICDEs in the switching multichannel mode was evaluated. In an in vivo study of 10 pigs, 11 ablations were performed by using three ICDEs in the switching multichannel mode. In addition, the difference in thermal injury to the gallbladder and stomach was compared between use of the ICDE and the ICCE. Mann-Whitney test and the Fisher exact test were used for statistical analysis.In the ex vivo study, the hepatic temperature in the nonablation direction was lower than 50\u00b0C; temperature higher than 47\u00b0C was maintained for less than 3 minutes, even 0.5 cm away from the ICDE; and the temperature at the liver-colon interface did not increase above 50\u00b0C. In the switching multichannel mode, a fused coagulation zone was created. In the in vivo study, confluent ablation was created in the inner circle of three ICDEs with a mean interelectrode distance of less than 2.6 cm. Use of the ICDE did not create a moderate-to-severe gallbladder wall injury in any of the pigs, but use of the ICCE caused injury in three of the five pigs (P > .05). The ICDE caused moderate-to-severe gastric wall injury at one of eight ablations, and the ICCE caused injury at eight of nine ablations (P < .05).Use of an ICDE can create a sufficient ablation in the desired direction and can decrease thermal injury to the adjacent organs.",
        "To determine if quantitative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging techniques (sodium MR imaging, glycosaminoglycan [GAG] chemical exchange saturation transfer [CEST], and T2* mapping) could be used as potential markers for biochemical changes in the Achilles tendon induced by ciprofloxacin intake.The ethics committee of the Medical University of Vienna approved the protocol (number 1225/2012), and all patients gave written informed consent. Fourteen ankles from seven men (mean age, 32 years \u00b1 12 [standard deviation]) were included in the study. All patients underwent 7-T MR imaging examinations of the Achilles tendon at baseline and 10 days and 5 months after ciprofloxacin intake. Sodium signal and T2* maps were acquired with the variable echo-time sequence and the GAG CEST values were acquired with a three-dimensional radiofrequency spoiled gradient-recalled-echo sequence.The mean sodium signal was significantly decreased by 25% in the whole tendon (from baseline to 10 days after ciprofloxacin intake, 130 arbitrary units [au] \u00b1 8 to 98 au \u00b1 5, respectively; P = .023) and returned to baseline after 5 months (116 au \u00b1 10), as observed also at the tendon insertion (baseline, 10 days after ciprofloxacin intake, and 5 months after ciprofloxacin intake, 134 au \u00b1 8, 105 au \u00b1 5, and 119 au \u00b1 9, respectively; P = .034). The mean GAG CEST value in the whole tendon was parallel to the sodium signal with a decrease from baseline to 10 days after ciprofloxacin intake, 4.74% \u00b1 0.75 to 4.50% \u00b1 0.23, respectively (P = .028) and an increase at 5 months after ciprofloxacin intake to 4.88% \u00b1 1.02.In conclusion, this study demonstrates a ciprofloxacin-induced reversible reduction of the normalized sodium MR imaging signal and the GAG CEST effect in the Achilles tendon of healthy volunteers. Changes in sodium MR imaging and GAG CEST in men may reflect a decrease of GAG content in the Achilles tendon after ciprofloxacin intake.",
        "Purpose To evaluate the impact of accountable care organizations (ACOs) on use of screening mammography in the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP), the largest value-based reimbursement program in U.S.Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval was waived, as the study used publicly available unidentifiable data. Medicare data were retrospectively obtained for participating ACOs from 2012 to 2014. Baseline information and the ACO-20 measure (percentage of women aged 40-69 years who underwent screening mammography within 24 months) were obtained. Negative binomial regression models were used to evaluate baseline and longitudinal mammography use, with stratified analyses performed for year of entry into the ACO, number of beneficiaries, and geographic region. Results A total of 333 ACOs with 5 329 831 Medicare beneficiaries (mean size, 16 006 beneficiaries) participated in the MSSP. Screening use varied across ACOs (median, 63.0%; range, 8.8%-90.3%), with differences found across regions (use was highest in the Midwest [66.6%] and lowest in the South [58.2%], P = .038). A total of 208 ACOs reported longitudinal outcomes, with mean change in screening mammography use of +2.6% (range, -33.2% to +42.2%), with 128 (61.6%) ACOs reporting improvements (incidence rate ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval: 1.02, 1.07) (P = .002). No longitudinal differences in use were seen across regions (P = .078), year of entry (P = .902), number of beneficiaries (P = .814), or total composite quality score (P = .324), nor was there a difference between ACOs that saved money and those that did not (P = .391). Conclusion ACOs in the MSSP have produced small significant improvements in screening mammography use. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016.",
        "To determine whether high-dose irreversible electroporation (IRE) ablation induces thermal effects in normal liver tissue.Animal care and use committee approval was obtained prior to the experiments. IRE ablation (n = 78) was performed by a single four-person team in vivo in 22 porcine livers by applying electric current to two 1.3-cm-diameter circular flat-plate electrodes spaced 1 cm apart. Cardiac-gated IRE pulses (n = 40-360) were systematically applied at varying voltages (1500-2900 V). End temperatures at the ablation zone center were measured and were correlated with ablation time, energy parameters, and resultant treatment effect as determined at gross pathologic and histopathologic examination. Temperatures were then monitored at the center and periphery of four ablations created by using a four-electrode IRE array (3000 V, 90 pulses per electrode pair). Data were analyzed by using multivariate analysis of variance with multiple comparisons and/or paired t tests and regression analysis, as appropriate.Temperature rose above the 34\u00b0C baseline after IRE in all flat-plate experiments and correlated linearly (R(2) = 0.39) with IRE \"energy dose\" (product of voltage and number of pulses) and more tightly in univariate analysis with both voltage and number of pulses. Thus, mean temperatures as high as 86\u00b0C \u00b1 3 (standard deviation) were seen for 2500 V and 270 pulses. Ablations of 90 pulses or more at 2500 V produced temperatures of 50\u00b0C or greater and classic gross and histopathologic findings of thermal coagulation (pyknotic nuclei and streaming cytoplasm). For lower IRE doses (ie, 2100 V, 90 pulses), temperatures remained below 45\u00b0C, and only IRE-associated pathologic findings (ie, swollen sinusoids, dehydrated cells, and hemorrhagic infiltrate) were seen. For the four-electrode arrays, temperatures measured 54.2\u00b0C \u00b1 6.1 at the electrode surfaces and 38.6\u00b0C \u00b1 3.2 at the ablation zone margin.In some conditions of high intensity, IRE can produce sufficient heating to induce \"white zone\" thermal coagulation. While this can be useful in some settings to increase tumor destruction, further characterization of the thermal profile created with clinical electrodes and energy parameters is therefore needed to better understand the best ways to avoid unintended damage when ablating near thermally sensitive critical structures.",

        "Purpose To assess the diagnostic performance of gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the evaluation of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Materials and Methods This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board. The requirement to obtain informed consent was waived. A total of 366 patients with HCC who underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging between January 2007 and May 2013, including 134 with malignant PVT, 49 with benign PVT, and 183 without PVT matched for age and sex, comprised our study population. PVTs were complete in 125 patients and partial in 58 and were located in a major portal vein (n = 159) or segmental portal vein (n = 24). Two radiologists independently reviewed the MR images and assessed the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in the detection and characterization of PVT according to location (major vs segmental) and type (complete vs partial). The Fisher exact or \u03c7(2) test was used to evaluate sensitivity difference between the subsets. Results Gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging showed good sensitivity (reviewer 1, 84% [154 of 183 patients]; reviewer 2, 70% [129 of 183 patients]) and high specificity (reviewer 1, 89% [163 of 183 patients]; reviewer 2, 96% [176 of 183 patients]) in the detection of PVT. Diagnostic accuracy for differentiating malignant PVT from benign PVT was high (reviewer 1, 92% [141 of 154 patients]; reviewer 2, 95% [122 of 129 patients]). However, there was slightly lower sensitivity for detecting segmental PVT compared with that of major PVT in the malignant PVT group (reviewer 1, 95% [104 of 110 patients] vs 88% [21 of 24 patients]; reviewer 2, 82% [90 of 110 patients] vs 79% [19 of 24 patients]; P = .203 and .775 for reviewers 1 and 2, respectively). Conclusion Gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging provided good diagnostic performance in the detection of PVT and the differentiation of malignant from benign PVT in patients with HCC. However, caution is needed when evaluating potential candidates for curative treatment because of the low sensitivity for segmental PVT in the malignant PVT group.

        "Purpose To study chest computed tomography (CT) in tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant adenocarcinoma. Materials and Methods This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board. Informed consent was waived. One hundred thirty consecutive patients with stage IV adenocarcinoma and EGFR mutations at a single tertiary center from November 2004 to April 2010 were enrolled retrospectively. CT images were analyzed with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor guidelines. Target lesions were classified by size, type, axial location, and metastasis. Patients were followed after TKI therapy, and treatment response was classified as partial response, stable disease, or progressive disease. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to correlate baseline CT features and EGFR mutations with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival. Results All patients underwent TKI therapy after identifying exon mutations in the EGFR gene, comprising exon 19 deletion (19del) (n = 77), L858R (n = 43), and exon 18 (n = 10). Outcomes were partial response (n = 103), stable disease (n = 22), and progressive disease (n = 5). In univariate analysis, PFS was significantly longer with small lesions (hazard ratio [HR], 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01, 1.03; P < .01), nodular main lesions (HR, 0.55; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.88; P = .01), or peripheral lesions (HR, 0.62; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.93; P = .02). In univariate analysis, PFS was significantly longer with smaller lesions (HR, 1.02; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.03; P < .01), nodular main lesions (HR, 0.55; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.88; P = .01), peripheral lesions (HR, 0.62; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.93; P = .02), 19del (HR, 0.33; 95% CI: 0.14, 0.77; P = .01), or L858R (HR, 0.39; 95% CI: 0.16, 0.97; P = .04). In multivariate analysis, PFS was significantly longer with 19del (HR, 0.30; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.84; P = .02) and shorter with scattered metastases (HR, 2.25; 95% CI: 1.44, 5.51; P < .01).

        "To retrospectively determine the relationship between apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) obtained with 3.0-T diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and Gleason grades in peripheral zone prostate cancer.The requirement to obtain institutional review board approval was waived. Fifty-one patients with prostate cancer underwent MR imaging before prostatectomy, including DW MR imaging with b values of 0, 50, 500, and 800 sec/mm(2). In prostatectomy specimens, separate slice-by-slice determinations of Gleason grade groups were performed according to primary, secondary, and tertiary Gleason grades. In addition, tumors were classified into qualitative grade groups (low-, intermediate-, or high-grade tumors). ADC maps were aligned to step-sections and regions of interest annotated for each tumor slice. The median ADC of tumors was related to qualitative grade groups with linear mixed-model regression analysis. The accuracy of the median ADC in the most aggressive tumor component in the differentiation of low- from combined intermediate- and high-grade tumors was summarized by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (A(z)).In 51 prostatectomy specimens, 62 different tumors and 251 step-section tumor lesions were identified. The median ADC in the tumors showed a negative relationship with Gleason grade group, and differences among the three qualitative grade groups were statistically significant (P < .001). Overall, with an increase of one qualitative grade group, the median ADC (\u00b1standard deviation) decreased 0.18 \u00d7 10(-3) mm(2)/sec \u00b1 0.02. Low-, intermediate-, and high-grade tumors had a median ADC of 1.30 \u00d7 10(-3) mm(2)/sec \u00b1 0.30, 1.07 \u00d7 10(-3) mm(2)/sec \u00b1 0.30, and 0.94 \u00d7 10(-3) mm(2)/sec \u00b1 0.30, respectively. ROC analysis showed a discriminatory performance of A(z) = 0.90 in discerning low-grade from combined intermediate- and high-grade lesions.ADCs at 3.0 T showed an inverse relationship to Gleason grades in peripheral zone prostate cancer. A high discriminatory performance was achieved in the differentiation of low-, intermediate-, and high-grade cancer.",
        "To evaluate the effectiveness of an electronic messaging system for accurately communicating important, but not emergent, abnormal radiology results to referring physicians.The Institutional Review Board deemed this proposal a quality improvement project that did not require formal approval. The electronic messaging system permits radiologists to submit online requests to communicate important, but not emergent, abnormal findings and recommended follow-up to two communications facilitators, who contact referring health care providers by e-mail or telephone. Of 10,510 electronic communications during a 3-year period, a representative sample of 500 communications were selected for detailed analysis. To eliminate bias associated with increased experience with the system, every 20th communication during the 3 years that the messaging system had been functional was examined. Parameters studied included the rate of successful communications with referring physicians, the frequency of these being accomplished within the goal of 48 hours from the time of radiologist submission, and the results of an e-mail survey of physicians to assess their satisfaction with the system.The radiologic abnormality was successfully communicated to the referring physician in every communication. Overall, a mean of 82.2% \u00b1 3.3 (standard deviation) of communications were accomplished within the goal of 48 hours, with this goal being met in 93.7% \u00b1 2.3 of communications submitted Monday through 3 pm on Thursday. Satisfaction among referring physicians was high (79.0% \u00b1 3.8 satisfied; 5.0% \u00b1 2.0 dissatisfied), especially among those with the most experience with the system.The electronic messaging system communicated important, but not emergent, abnormal radiology results to referring physicians in a timely, accurate, and relatively inexpensive manner.http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.10101015/-/DC1.",
        "Purpose To evaluate the feasibility of percutaneous isolated pancreas perfusion (PIPP) by using a pig model. Materials and Methods All experiments were approved by the institutional Animal Experiment Ethics Committee. Fifteen pigs were assigned to five groups, and PIPP was performed. Angiographic and dye injection studies were performed to confirm the patency of the PIPP system (group 1). Blood that contained cisplatin (1.5 mg per kilogram of body weight) in an extracorporeal circuit was circulated through the pancreas at three infusion rates (40, 60, and 80 mL/min) to determine the optimal infusion rate in terms of safety and pharmacologic effectiveness (groups 2, 3, and 4, respectively). Chronological laboratory data and histologic findings were assessed in group 5, which received the optimal infusion rate. Maximum platinum concentration (Cmax) and area under the platinum concentration\u2013time curve were compared by using the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests. Results Angiography and dye injection confirmed the patency of the PIPP system. Histopathologic examinations showed no abnormalities in the pancreas or other organs at a 40 mL/min infusion rate of cisplatin. However, edematous changes in the pancreas were observed at higher infusion rates. The pharmacologic effectiveness did not differ significantly among groups; therefore, the optimal infusion rate of 40 mL/min was selected. The median pancreatic-to-systemic exposure ratios were 71.8 for Cmax and 54.8 for the area under the curve. All laboratory data remained normal or returned to pretreatment levels within 1 week. Conclusion PIPP at a 40 mL/min infusion rate appears to be safe and feasible for perfusion of the pancreas. \u00a9 RSNA, 2015",
        "Purpose To determine whether spinal cord atrophy differs among disease subtypes in multiple sclerosis (MS) and whether it offers diagnostic and clinical correlative information beyond that provided by other magnetic resonance (MR) imaging markers. Materials and Methods The institutional review board approved the study; all subjects gave written informed consent. Upper cervical cord cross-sectional area (UCCA), brain and spinal cord lesion loads, and brain atrophy were measured in 440 patients with MS (311 with relapsing-remitting [RR] MS, 92 with secondary-progressive [SP] MS, and 37 with primary-progressive [PP] MS) studied in two centers. Disability was scored with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), the timed 25-foot walk test (TWT), and the nine-hole peg test. UCCA was compared between groups with the Mann-Whitney U test. Correlations were assessed with the Spearman \u03c1 test. Multivariate associations between UCCA and clinical and other MR imaging parameters, including number of hypointense brain lesions on T1-weighted MR images, presence of diffuse abnormalities, and number of involved segments in the spinal cord, were assessed by using multiple linear regression, adjusted for study center site. Results The UCCA in patients with SP MS (median, 79 mm2; interquartile range, 72.4\u201384.9 mm2) and PP MS (median, 77.3 mm2; interquartile range, 69\u201382.5 mm2) was significantly smaller (P < .001) than that in patients with RR MS (median, 84 mm2; interquartile range, 78.7\u201389.3 mm2). UCCA was inversely correlated with EDSS score, TWT, and nine-hole peg test findings (\u03c1 \u2264 \u22120.29, P < .001 for all comparisons). UCCA, number of hypointense brain lesions on T1-weighted MR images, presence of diffuse abnormalities, and number of involved segments in the spinal cord were found to be significant explanatory factors for clinical disability (R2 = 0.564). The UCCA and the number of hypointense brain lesions on T1-weighted images were the strongest MR imaging parameters for explaining physical disability, as measured with the EDSS. Conclusion Spinal cord abnormalities have a strong effect on clinical disability in MS. MR imaging\u2013derived UCCA was found to be the most significant spinal cord parameter for explaining EDSS score. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "Purpose To compare biopsy performance of two approaches for multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR)-targeted biopsy (TB) with that of extended systematic biopsy (SB) in prostate cancer (PCa) detection. Materials and Methods This institutional review board\u2013approved multicenter prospective study (May 2009 to January 2011) included 95 patients with informed consent who were suspected of having PCa, with a suspicious abnormality (target) at prebiopsy MR. Patients underwent 12-core SB and four-core TB with transrectal ultrasonographic (US) guidance, with two cores aimed visually (cognitive TB [TB-COG]) and two cores aimed using transrectal US\u2013MR fusion software (fusion-guided TB [TB-FUS]). SB and TB positivity for cancer and sampling quality (mean longest core cancer length, Gleason score) were compared. Clinically significant PCa was any 3 mm or greater core cancer length or any greater than 3 Gleason pattern for SB or any cancer length for TB. Statistical analysis included t test, paired \u03c72 test, and \u03ba statistic. Primary end point (core cancer length) was calculated (paired t test). Results Among 95 patients (median age, 65 years; mean prostate-specific antigen level, 10.05 ng/mL [10.05 \u03bcg/L]), positivity rate for PCa was 59% (n = 56) for SB and 69% (n = 66) for TB (P = .033); rate for clinically significant PCa was 52% (n = 49) for SB and 67% (n = 64) for TB (P = .0011). Cancer was diagnosed through TB in 16 patients (17%) with negative SB results. Mean longest core cancer lengths were 4.6 mm for SB and 7.3 mm for TB (P < .0001). In 12 of 51 (24%) MR imaging targets with positive SB and TB results, TB led to Gleason score upgrading. In 79 MR imaging targets, positivity for cancer was 47% (n = 37) with TB-COG and 53% (n = 42) with TB-FUS (P = .16). Neither technique was superior for Gleason score assessment. Conclusion Prebiopsy MR imaging combined with transrectal US\u2013guided TB increases biopsy performance in detecting PCa, especially clinically significant PCa. No significant difference was observed between TB-FUS and TB-COG for TB guidance. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.13121501/-/DC1",
        "Purpose To evaluate the prognostic importance and predictive performance of volume-based parameters of fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in patients with stage I non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Materials and Methods This study had institutional review board approval. All patients gave written informed consent for SBRT as well as for future anonymous use of clinical data. Data in 88 patients with stage I NSCLC (68 patients with T1N0M0 disease and 20 with T2aN0M0 disease) who had undergone FDG PET/CT and then SBRT were retrospectively evaluated. Seventy-seven tumors were histopathologically proved (48 adenocarcinomas, 24 squamous cell carcinomas, and five unspecified non\u2013small cell carcinomas), and the remaining 11 tumors were diagnosed clinically without histopathologic diagnosis. Maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) were analyzed. The MTV of the primary tumor was calculated as all voxels with an SUV of 2.5 or greater within the isocontour line, while TLG was calculated as MTV multiplied by the average SUV, by using fixed thresholds of either 50% (TLG50) or 60% (TLG60) of the maximum intratumoral FDG activity. The prognostic importance of PET parameters and other clinicopathologic variables (age, sex, tumor size, tumor location [peripheral or central], and biologically effective dose) was assessed by using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis of overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) for both univariate and multiple-variable analyses. Results The median follow-up period was 33 months. At 3 years, OS and DFS were 70.0% and 49.7%, respectively. In the univariate analyses, SUVmax (P = .001), MTV (P = .002), TLG50 (P = .001), and TLG60 (P < .001) were found to be significantly associated with DFS. In multiple variable analysis, these parameters were also significantly associated with DFS (P = .011 for SUVmax, P = .010 for MTV, P = .004 for TLG50, and P = .005 for TLG60). Only volumetric parameters (MTV, TLG50, and TLG60) were significant indicators of DFS in patients with tumors larger than 3 cm. Conclusion SUVmax, MTV, and TLG at FDG PET/CT have a prognostic role for patients with NSCLC treated with SBRT. When tumors are larger than 3 cm, only MTV and TLG are predictive of DFS. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To determine feasibility of performing bilateral dual-energy (DE) contrast agent\u2013enhanced (CE) digital mammography and to evaluate its performance compared with conventional digital mammography and breast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in women with known breast cancer. Materials and Methods This study was approved by the institutional review board and was HIPAA compliant. Written informed consent was obtained. Patient accrual began in March 2010 and ended in August 2011. Mean patient age was 49.6 years (range, 25\u201374 years). Feasibility was evaluated in 10 women with newly diagnosed breast cancer who were injected with 1.5 mL per kilogram of body weight of iohexol and imaged between 2.5 and 10 minutes after injection. Once feasibility was confirmed, 52 women with newly diagnosed cancer who had undergone breast MR imaging gave consent to undergo DE CE digital mammography. Positive findings were confirmed with pathologic findings. Results Feasibility was confirmed with no adverse events. Visualization of tumor enhancement was independent of timing after contrast agent injection for up to 10 minutes. MR imaging and DE CE digital mammography both depicted 50 (96%) of 52 index tumors; conventional mammography depicted 42 (81%). Lesions depicted by using DE CE digital mammography ranged from 4 to 67 mm in size (median, 17 mm). DE CE digital mammography depicted 14 (56%) of 25 additional ipsilateral cancers compared with 22 (88%) of 25 for MR imaging. There were two false-positive findings with DE CE digital mammography and 13 false-positive findings with MR imaging. There was one contralateral cancer, which was not evident with either modality. Conclusion Bilateral DE CE digital mammography was feasible and easily accomplished. It was used to detect known primary tumors at a rate comparable to that of MR imaging and higher than that of conventional digital mammography. DE CE digital mammography had a lower sensitivity for detecting additional ipsilateral cancers than did MR imaging, but the specificity was higher. \u00a9 RSNA, 2012",
        "To examine the usefulness of diffusion kurtosis imaging for the diagnosis of Parkinson disease (PD).Examinations were performed with the understanding and written consent of each subject, with local ethics committee approval, and in compliance with national legislation and Declaration of Helsinki guidelines. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 30 patients with idiopathic PD (mean age, 64.5 years \u00b1 3.4 [standard deviation]) and 30 healthy subjects (mean age, 65.0 years \u00b1 5.1). Mean kurtosis, fractional anisotropy, and mean, axial, and radial diffusivity of the basal ganglia were compared between the groups. Disease severity was assessed by using Hoehn and Yahr staging and the motor section of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (mean scores, 2.0 and 33.6, respectively). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to compare the diagnostic accuracies of the indexes of interest. Pearson correlation coefficient analysis was used to correlate imaging findings with disease severity.Mean kurtosis in the putamen was higher in the PD group (0.93 \u00b1 0.15) than in the control group (0.71 \u00b1 0.09) (P < .000416). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.95 for both the ipsilateral putamen and the ipsilateral substantia nigra. The mean kurtosis for the ipsilateral substantia nigra had the best diagnostic performance (mean cutoff, 1.10; sensitivity, 0.92; specificity, 0.87). In contrast, AUCs for the tensor-derived indexes ranged between 0.43 (axial and radial diffusivity in substantia nigra) and 0.65 (fractional anisotropy in substantia nigra).Diffusion kurtosis imaging in the basal ganglia, as compared with conventional diffusion-tensor imaging, can improve the diagnosis of PD.",
        "To combine fluorine 19 ((19)F) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and golden angle radial acquisition and to assess the feasibility of (19)F MR imaging golden angle-based tracking for catheter tracking applications and simultaneous three-dimensional (3D) intestinal tracking of ingested (19)F-labeled capsules in vivo.Approval from the local ethical committee and informed consent from the subject were obtained. In vitro studies were performed to assess (19)F MR imaging golden angle-based tracking reliability with regard to temporal resolution and different tracking strategies (boundary condition-free tracking, composite image-based tracking, and model-based tracking). In vivo performance of the method was investigated in one healthy volunteer on 2 days. On study day 1, a duodenal catheter incorporating five (19)F-labeled capsules was administered nasally, and its 3D movement was tracked inside the stomach and esophagus. On study day 2, three (19)F-labeled capsules were swallowed, and intestinal movement was tracked.Simultaneous in vivo 3D tracking of multiple (19)F-labeled capsules was successfully performed without incorporation of boundary conditions at a temporal resolution of 252 msec. Incorporation of boundary conditions with composite image-based tracking and model-based tracking increased tracking reliability and enabled temporal resolution as high as 108 msec.Use of (19)F MR imaging golden angle-based capsule tracking enables in vivo tracking of (19)F-labeled capsules and catheters at high temporal resolution. The presented method is applicable to physioanatomic studies of the gastrointestinal tract and shows potential for real-time tracking in interventional radiology.",
        "History A 70-year-old woman presented to a peripheral hospital with signs and symptoms of acute chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation. The patient also reported acute on chronic onset of thoracolumbar back pain over a period of 24 hours. She denied any history of recent trauma or intravenous drug use. She did not have any long-term indwelling catheters. The patient's medical history was also complicated by stage 4 renal failure from long-standing type II diabetes, hypertension, iron deficiency anemia, aortic stenosis, and prior bariatric surgery. The patient was not undergoing dialysis for her renal dysfunction, nor was she receiving steroids for COPD. On clinical examination, she was afebrile and tachypneic. Although she was not amenable to a full neurologic examination, she reported subjective leg weakness. There were no localizing signs or evidence of myelopathy. Perianal sensation and rectal tone were preserved. Pulmonary examination revealed wheezes and decreased basilar air entry. The patient's white blood cell count was 6.8 \u00d7 10(9)/L. Her blood chemistry was normal, aside from an elevated blood creatinine level of 158 mmol/L. Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated at 56 mm/h, and her C-reactive protein level was normal at 4.4 mg/L (41.9 nmol/L). Chest radiographs showed mild pulmonary edema with a small right pleural effusion. The patient was transferred to our facility for evaluation of findings on thoracic spine radiographs obtained at a peripheral hospital. Unenhanced thoracic spine magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed first and was followed by computed tomography (CT) to further delineate the findings. The patient's renal status precluded intravenous contrast material administration.",
        "To use baseline computed tomographic (CT) angiography to analyze imaging and clinical end points in an Interventional Management of Stroke III cohort to identify patients who would benefit from endovascular stroke therapy.The primary clinical end point was 90-day dichotomized modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. Secondary end points were 90-day mRS score distribution and 24-hour recanalization. Prespecified subgroup was baseline proximal occlusions (internal carotid, M1, or basilar arteries). Exploratory analyses were subsets with any occlusion and specific sites of occlusion (two-sided \u03b1 = .01).Of 656 subjects, 306 (47%) underwent baseline CT angiography or magnetic resonance angiography. Of 306, 282 (92%) had arterial occlusions. At baseline CT angiography, proximal occlusions (n = 220) demonstrated no difference in primary outcome (41.3% [62 of 150] endovascular vs 38% [27 of 70] intravenous [IV] tissue-plasminogen activator [tPA]; relative risk, 1.07 [99% confidence interval: 0.67, 1.70]; P = .70); however, 24-hour recanalization rate was higher for endovascular treatment (n = 167; 84.3% [97 of 115] endovascular vs 56% [29 of 52] IV tPA; P < .001). Exploratory subgroup analysis for any occlusion at baseline CT angiography did not demonstrate significant differences between endovascular and IV tPA arms for primary outcome (44.7% [85 of 190] vs 38% [35 of 92], P = .29), although ordinal shift analysis of full mRS distribution demonstrated a trend toward more favorable outcome (P = .011). Carotid T- or L-type occlusion (terminal internal carotid artery [ICA] with M1 middle cerebral artery and/or A1 anterior cerebral artery involvement) or tandem (extracranial or intracranial) ICA and M1 occlusion subgroup also showed a trend favoring endovascular treatment over IV tPA alone for primary outcome (26% [12 of 46] vs 4% [one of 23], P = .047).Significant differences were identified between treatment arms for 24-hour recanalization in proximal occlusions; carotid T- or L-type and tandem ICA and M1 occlusions showed greater recanalization and a trend toward better outcome with endovascular treatment. Vascular imaging should be mandated in future endovascular trials to identify such occlusions. Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To compare malignancy risk stratification of thyroid nodules with the 2014 American Thyroid Association (ATA) management guidelines and the Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TIRADS). Materials and Methods This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board. The requirement to obtain informed consent was waived. From November 2013 to July 2014, 1293 thyroid nodules in 1241 patients (mean age, 50.8 years \u00b1 13.5) were included in this study. All nodules measured at least 10 mm. Solidity, hypoechogenicity or marked hypoechogenicity, microlobulated to irregular margin, microcalcifications or mixed calcifications, and nonparallel shape were considered suspicious features at ultrasonography (US). A TIRADS category and the US pattern as determined with ATA guidelines were assigned to each nodule. The correlation between the TIRADS category or ATA pattern and the malignancy rate was evaluated with the Spearman rank test. Results Of the 1293 thyroid nodules, 1059 (81.9%) were benign and 234 (18.1%) were malignant. Forty-four of the 1293 nodules (3.4%) did not meet the criteria for the ATA patterns and were classified as \"not specified.\" The malignancy rates of TIRADS category 3, 4a, 4b, 4c, and 5 nodules were 1.9% (six of 316 nodules), 4.2% (17 of 408 nodules), 12.9% (33 of 256 nodules), 49.8% (130 of 261 nodules), and 92.3% (48 of 52 nodules), respectively, with significant differences between categories (P < .001). Malignancy rates of nodules with very low, low, intermediate, and high suspicion for malignancy with the ATA guidelines and not specified patterns were 2.7% (11 of 407 nodules), 3.1% (10 of 323 nodules), 16.7% (39 of 233 nodules), 58.0% (166 of 286 nodules), and 18.2% (eight of 44 nodules), respectively, with significant differences between patterns (P < .001). There was high correlation between classification with TIRADS (r = 1.000, P < .001) and ATA guidelines (r = 0.900, P = 0.037), without statistically significant differences (P = .873). Conclusion Both TIRADS and the ATA guidelines provide effective malignancy risk stratification for thyroid nodules. Nodules that do not meet the criteria for a specific pattern with the ATA guidelines have a relatively high risk of malignancy (18.2%). \u00a9 RSNA, 2015 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To determine whether repeated exposure of the pediatric brain to a linear gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) is associated with an increase in signal intensity (SI) relative to that in GBCA-naive control subjects at unenhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Materials and Methods This single-center, retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board and compliant with HIPAA. The authors evaluated 46 pediatric patients who had undergone at least three GBCA-enhanced MR examinations (30 patients for two-group analysis and 16 for pre- and post-GBCA exposure comparisons) and 57 age-matched GBCA-naive control subjects. The SI in the globus pallidus, thalamus, dentate nucleus, and pons was measured at unenhanced T1-weighted MR imaging. Globus pallidus-thalamus and dentate nucleus-pons SI ratios were calculated and compared between groups and relative to total cumulative gadolinium dose, age, sex, and number of and mean time between GBCA-enhanced examinations. Analysis included the Wilcoxon signed rank test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, and Spearman correlation coefficient. Results Patients who underwent multiple GBCA-enhanced examinations had increased SI ratios within the dentate nucleus (mean SI ratio \u00b1 standard error of the mean for two-group comparison: 1.007 \u00b1 0.0058 for GBCA-naive group and 1.046 \u00b1 0.0060 for GBCA-exposed group [P < .001]; mean SI ratio for pre- and post-GBCA comparison: 0.995 \u00b1 0.0062 for pre-GBCA group and 1.035 \u00b1 0.0063 for post-GBCA group [P < .001]) but not the globus pallidus (mean SI ratio for two-group comparison: 1.131 \u00b1 0.0070 for GBCA-naive group and 1.014 \u00b1 0.0091 for GBCA-exposed group [P = .21]; mean SI ratio for pre- and post-GBCA comparison: 1.068 \u00b1 0.0094 for pre-GBCA group and 1.093 \u00b1 0.0134 for post-GBCA group [P = .12]). There was a significant correlation between dentate nucleus SI and total cumulative gadolinium dose (r = 0.4; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.03, 0.67; P = .03), but not between dentate nucleus SI and patient age (r = 0.23; 95% CI: -0.15, 0.56; P = .22), sex (mean SI ratio: 1.046 \u00b1 0.0072 for boys and 1.045 \u00b1 0.0110 for girls; P = .88), number of contrast-enhanced examinations (r = 0.13; 95% CI: -0.25, 0.48; P = .49), or time between contrast-enhanced examinations (r = -0.06; 95% CI: -0.42, 0.32; P = .75). Conclusion SI in the pediatric brain increases on unenhanced T1-weighted MR images with repeated exposure to a linear GBCA. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016.",
        "To investigate associations between breast cancer molecular subtype and semiautomatically extracted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging features.Imaging and genomic data from the Cancer Genome Atlas and the Cancer Imaging Archive for 48 patients with breast cancer from four institutions in the United States were used in this institutional review board approval-exempt study. Computer vision algorithms were applied to extract 23 imaging features from lesions indicated by a breast radiologist on MR images. Morphologic, textural, and dynamic features were extracted. Molecular subtype was determined on the basis of genomic analysis. Associations between the imaging features and molecular subtype were evaluated by using logistic regression and likelihood ratio tests. The analysis controlled for the age of the patients, their menopausal status, and the orientation of the MR images (sagittal vs axial).There is an association (P = .0015) between the luminal B subtype and a dynamic contrast material-enhancement feature that quantifies the relationship between lesion enhancement and background parenchymal enhancement. Cancers with a higher ratio of lesion enhancement rate to background parenchymal enhancement rate are more likely to be luminal B subtype.The luminal B subtype of breast cancer is associated with MR imaging features that relate the enhancement dynamics of the tumor and the background parenchyma.",
        "In September 2015, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) published a report titled \"Improving Diagnosis in Health Care,\" in which it was recommended that \"health care organizations should adopt policies and practices that promote a nonpunitive culture that values open discussion and feedback on diagnostic performance.\" It may seem counterintuitive that a report addressing a highly technical skill such as medical diagnosis would be focused on organizational culture. The wisdom becomes clearer, however, when examined in the light of recent advances in the understanding of human error and individual and organizational performance. The current dominant model for radiologist performance improvement is scoring-based peer review, which reflects a traditional quality assurance approach, derived from manufacturing in the mid-1900s. Far from achieving the goals of the IOM, which are celebrating success, recognizing mistakes as an opportunity to learn, and fostering openness and trust, we have found that scoring-based peer review tends to drive radiologists inward, against each other, and against practice leaders. Modern approaches to quality improvement focus on using and enhancing interpersonal professional relationships to achieve and maintain high levels of individual and organizational performance. In this article, the authors review the recommendations set forth by the recent IOM report, discuss the science and theory that underlie several of those recommendations, and assess how well they fit with the current dominant approach to radiology peer review. The authors also offer an alternative approach to peer review: peer feedback, learning, and improvement (or more succinctly, \"peer learning\"), which they believe is better aligned with the principles promoted by the IOM. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016",
        "In anticipation of breast density notification legislation in the state of California, which would require notification of women with heterogeneously and extremely dense breast tissue, a working group of breast imagers and breast cancer risk specialists was formed to provide a common response framework. The California Breast Density Information Group identified key elements and implications of the law, researching scientific evidence needed to develop a robust response. In particular, issues of risk associated with dense breast tissue, masking of cancers by dense tissue on mammograms, and the efficacy, benefits, and harms of supplementary screening tests were studied and consensus reached. National guidelines and peer-reviewed published literature were used to recommend that women with dense breast tissue at screening mammography follow supplemental screening guidelines based on breast cancer risk assessment. The goal of developing educational materials for referring clinicians and patients was reached with the construction of an easily accessible Web site that contains information about breast density, breast cancer risk assessment, and supplementary imaging. This multi-institutional, multidisciplinary approach may be useful for organizations to frame responses as similar legislation is passed across the United States. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To determine the usefulness of whole-body diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to assess the response of bone metastases to treatment in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Materials and Methods A phase II prospective clinical trial of the poly-(adenosine diphosphate\u2013ribose) polymerase inhibitor olaparib in mCRPC included a prospective magnetic resonance (MR) imaging substudy; the study was approved by the institutional research board, and written informed consent was obtained. Whole-body DWI was performed at baseline and after 12 weeks of olaparib administration by using 1.5-T MR imaging. Areas of abnormal signal intensity on DWI images in keeping with bone metastases were delineated to derive total diffusion volume (tDV); five target lesions were also evaluated. Associations of changes in volume of bone metastases and median apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) with response to treatment were assessed by using the Mann-Whitney test and logistic regression; correlation with prostate-specific antigen level and circulating tumor cell count were assessed by using Spearman correlation (r). Results Twenty-one patients were included. All six responders to olaparib showed a decrease in tDV, while no decrease was observed in all nonresponders; this difference between responders and nonresponders was significant (P = .001). Increases in median ADC were associated with increased odds of response (odds ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00, 1.15; P = .04). A positive association was detected between changes in tDV and best percentage change in prostate-specific antigen level and circulating tumor cell count (r = 0.63 [95% CI: 0.27, 0.83] and r = 0.77 [95% CI: 0.51, 0.90], respectively). When assessing five target lesions, decreases in volume were associated with response (odds ratio for volume increase, 0.89; 95% CI: 0.80, 0.99; P = .037). Conclusion This pilot study showed that decreases in volume and increases in median ADC of bone metastases assessed with whole-body DWI can potentially be used as indicators of response to olaparib in mCRPC.

        "To determine the added value of hepatobiliary phase images in gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the evaluation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Institutional review board approved this retrospective study and waived the informed consent. Fifty-nine patients with 84 HCCs underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR examinations that included 20-minute delayed hepatobiliary phase imaging. MR imaging was performed with a 1.5-T system in 19 patients and a 3.0-T system in 40 patients. A total of 113 hepatic nodules were documented for analysis. Three radiologists independently reviewed two sets of MR images: set 1, unenhanced (T1- and T2-weighted) and gadoxetic acid-enhanced dynamic images; set 2, hepatobiliary phase images and unenhanced and gadoxetic acid-enhanced dynamic images. For each observer, the diagnostic accuracy was compared by using the area under the alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic curve (A(z)). Sensitivity and specificity were also calculated and compared between the two sets.For all observers, A(z) values were higher with the addition of the hepatobiliary phase. The observer who had the least experience in abdominal imaging (2 years) demonstrated significant improvement in A(z), from 0.895 in set 1 to 0.951 in set 2 (P = .049). Sensitivity increased with the addition of hepatobiliary phase images but did not reach statistical significance. Nine HCCs (10.7%) in six patients (10.1%) were seen only on hepatobiliary phase images.Hepatobiliary phase images obtained after gadoxetic acid-enhanced dynamic MR imaging may improve diagnosis of HCC and assist in surgical planning.",
        "Purpose To compare lesion detection and image quality of chest computed tomographic (CT) images acquired at various tube current\u2013time products (40\u2013150 mAs) and reconstructed with adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) or filtered back projection (FBP). Materials and Methods In this Institutional Review Board\u2013approved HIPAA-compliant study, CT data from 23 patients (mean age, 63 years \u00b1 7.3 [standard deviation]; 10 men, 13 women) were acquired at varying tube current\u2013time products (40, 75, 110, and 150 mAs) on a 64-row multidetector CT scanner with 10-cm scan length. All patients gave informed consent. Data sets were reconstructed at 30%, 50%, and 70% ASIR-FBP blending. Two thoracic radiologists assessed image noise, visibility of small structures, lesion conspicuity, and diagnostic confidence. Objective noise and CT number were measured in the thoracic aorta. CT dose index volume, dose-length product, weight, and transverse diameter were recorded. Data were analyzed by using analysis of variance and the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results FBP had unacceptable noise at 40 and 75 mAs in 17 and five patients, respectively, whereas ASIR had acceptable noise at 40\u2013150 mAs. Objective noise with 30%, 50%, and 70% ASIR blending (11.8 \u00b1 3.8, 9.6 \u00b1 3.1, and 7.5 \u00b1 2.6, respectively) was lower than that with FBP (15.8 \u00b1 4.8) (P < .0001). No lesions were missed on FBP or ASIR images. Lesion conspicuity was graded as well seen on both FBP and ASIR images (P < .05). Mild pixilated blotchy texture was noticed with 70% blended ASIR images. Conclusion Acceptable image quality can be obtained for chest CT images acquired at 40 mAs by using ASIR without any substantial artifacts affecting diagnostic confidence. \u00a9 RSNA, 2011 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.11101450/-/DC1",
        "To describe imaging findings of early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, dynamic contrast material-enhanced computed tomography (CT), CT during arterial portography (CTAP), and CT during hepatic arteriography (CTHA) and to compare the diagnostic performance of each modality for small (\u2264 2 cm) HCC.The institute ethics committee deemed study approval unnecessary. One hundred eight resected small lesions in 64 patients were diagnosed as a dysplastic nodule (DN) (n = 12), progressed HCC (n = 66), or early HCC (n = 30). All but two patients underwent all imaging examinations. The imaging characteristics of the lesions with each modality were determined. To evaluate the diagnostic performance of the modalities, two radiologists graded the presence of HCC with use of a five-point confidence scale. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (A(z)), sensitivity, and specificity of each modality were compared.The imaging features that are statistically significant for differentiating an early HCC from a DN include fat-containing lesions at dual-echo T1-weighted MR imaging (seen in 16 of the 30 early HCCs and none of the DNs), low attenuation at unenhanced CT (seen in 13 of the 30 early HCCs and none of the DNs), low attenuation at CTAP (seen in 11 of the 30 early HCCs and none of the DNs), and low signal intensity at hepatocyte phase gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging (seen in 29 of the 30 early HCCs and none of the DNs). The diagnostic performance of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging (A(z), 0.98 and 0.99) was significantly greater than that of contrast-enhanced CT (A(z), 0.87) and CTHA-CTAP (A(z), 0.85 and 0.86) owing to its significantly higher sensitivity (P < .001).Gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging is the most useful imaging technique for evaluating small HCC, including early HCC.",

        "Purpose To compare the diagnostic accuracy of fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) in the detection of colon lesions with that of delayed PET/computed tomography (CT) performed after the administration of a laxative-augmented contrast medium. Materials and Methods All patients gave written informed consent according to the guidelines issued by the institutional review board. In a prospective study performed from November 2005 to December 2006, images obtained in 847 patients were reviewed by two physicians in consensus. Colorectal FDG uptake on initial PET images that exceeded background FDG accumulation was graded as minimal, equivocal, or positive. When the initial PET scan revealed a colorectal region of increased uptake, either oral or anal laxative-augmented contrast medium was administered on the basis of the site of colorectal FDG focus and delayed PET/CT was performed. Initial PET findings were reevaluated and revised when necessary. Comparison was performed on a per-patient basis. Findings at histopathologic analysis and clinical follow-up served as the reference standard. The accuracy of PET was compared with that of PET/CT by using the McNemar test. Results Colorectal FDG foci were seen on initial images in 137 patients. Uptake on the initial images was reported as minimal in 14 patients, equivocal in 68, and positive in 55. With use of a laxative-augmented contrast medium and delayed PET/CT, the proportions of equivocal and positive results decreased by 84% (57 of 68 patients) and 58% (18 of 31 patients), respectively. The accuracy of delayed PET/CT in the depiction of colorectal cancer was greater than that of initial PET (93.4% [128 of 137 patients] vs 71.5% [98 of 137 patients], respectively; P < .01). Conclusion Delayed PET/CT with laxative-augmented contrast medium is more accurate than initial PET alone in the detection of colorectal cancer. This approach has promise as a tool for guiding decisions about how to treat patients with colorectal FDG foci. \u00a9 RSNA, 2011 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.11101193/-/DC1",
        "To test the in vivo feasibility of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of ischemia reperfusion injury after syngeneic lung transplantation in mice and to characterize tissue relaxation properties by using very short echo-time (TE) sequences at 4.7 T.The experimental protocol was approved by the institutional animal committee. MR imaging was performed in six C57BL/6 mice 24 hours after the animals underwent syngeneic orthotopic left lung transplantation. A small-animal MR imager was equipped with a linear polarized hydrogen birdcage mouse coil. In addition to conventional T1-weighted spoiled gradient-echo and T2-weighted fast spin-echo sequences, three-dimensional very short TE sequences (50-5000 \u03bcsec) were performed. Color-encoded parametric maps of T2* transverse relaxation times were calculated on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Quantitative T2* values of the parenchyma of the transplanted lungs and relative spin density were compared by using region-of-interest analysis with the two-sided paired Student t test. After MR imaging, transplanted lungs were processed for histologic examination.Transplanted ventilated lungs in all the mice showed similar low signal intensity with the conventional T1- and T2-weighted sequences. The very short TE sequence exhibited signal yield in the lungs that was higher than that of the noise level. Increased spin density (50.8% \u00b1 26.9 [standard deviation], P = .006) and longer T2* relaxation time (1041 \u03bcsec \u00b1 424, P = .016) were found in the transplanted lungs. Best visualization was possible using color-encoded log-transformed parametric T2* maps. Conventional T2-weighted sequences revealed small pleural effusions. Histologic examination demonstrated ischemia reperfusion injury with a predominance of either cell influx or edema.Ischemia reperfusion injury after syngeneic lung transplantation can be visualized and characterized using very short TE sequences showing different MR imaging relaxation properties when compared with normal lung parenchyma.",
        "To retrospectively determine findings at gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in hypervascular pseudolesions that were observed at computed tomography (CT) during hepatic arteriography, with special focus on distinguishing these pseudolesions from hypervascular hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs).The institute ethics committee deemed study approval unnecessary. The study population comprised 80 patients (55 men, 25 women) with chronic liver disease who underwent CT during hepatic arteriography and arterial portography, gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging, and follow-up dynamic contrast material-enhanced CT. The diagnosis of 104 pseudolesions and 123 HCCs was confirmed by means of histopathologic or multimodality evaluation. Two radiologists assessed the MR imaging findings of HCCs and pseudolesions in consensus, including the signal intensities (SIs) of the lesions on T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted (DW), and contrast-enhanced hepatocyte-phase images. The findings of nodular pseudolesions and HCCs were compared with the Fisher exact test. Additionally, the hepatocyte-phase SI ratio (ratio of lesion SI to liver SI) for HCCs and pseudolesions was compared by means of the Mann-Whitney U test.There were 62 wedge-shaped, 32 nodular, and 10 linear pseudolesions. On gadoxetic acid-enhanced hepatocyte-phase MR images, 15% of pseudolesions (16 of 104) were hypointense compared with surrounding liver tissue. The mean hepatocyte-phase SI ratio of HCCs (0.65 +/- 0.14 [standard deviation]) was significantly lower (P < .01) than that of the nodular pseudolesions (0.95 +/- 0.11). The optimal cutoff value of hepatocyte-phase SI ratio for distinguishing between HCC and nodular pseudolesion was 0.84. No nodular pseudolesions were visible on DW images.Gadoxetic acid-enhanced hepatocyte-phase MR imaging and DW imaging could be used to distinguish hypervascular pseudolesions from hypervascular HCCs; a hepatocyte-phase SI ratio below 0.84 and visibility on DW images were findings specific for HCCs rather than pseudolesions.",
        "Purpose To evaluate the effectiveness of small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) in suppressing granulation tissue formation caused by bare metallic stent placement in a rat urethral model. Materials and Methods All experiments were approved by the committee of animal research. In 20 Sprague-Dawley male rats (weight range, 300\u2013350 g), a self-expanding metallic bare stent was inserted in the urethra with fluoroscopic guidance. One group of 10 rats (group A) was treated with MMP-9 siRNA/bioreducible branched polyethylenimine\u2013disulfide cross-linked\u2013indocyanine green (bioreducible BPEI\u2013SS-ICG), while the other group of 10 rats (group B) received control siRNA/bioreducible BPEI\u2013SS-ICG treatment. All rats were sacrificed at 4 weeks. The therapeutic effectiveness of the MMP-9 siRNA/bioreducible BPEI\u2013SS-ICG complex was assessed by comparing the two results of retrograde urethrography, histologic examination, and quantification of MMP-9 by using zymography and Western blot analysis between the two groups. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to evaluate differences. Results Stent placement was successful in all rats without a single case of migration at follow-up. Retrograde urethrography performed 4 weeks after stent placement demonstrated significantly larger luminal diameters of the urethra within the stents in group A compared with those in group B (P = .011). Histologic analysis revealed that the mean percentage of granulation tissue area (P < .001), mean number of epithelial layers (P < .001), and mean thickness of submucosal fibrosis (P < .001) were significantly decreased in group A compared with group B. Meanwhile, the mean density of inflammatory cell infiltration did not significantly differ between the two groups (P = .184).

        "To investigate the potential of spectral computed tomography (CT) (popularly referred to as multicolor CT), used in combination with a gold high-density lipoprotein nanoparticle contrast agent (Au-HDL), for characterization of macrophage burden, calcification, and stenosis of atherosclerotic plaques.The local animal care committee approved all animal experiments. A preclinical spectral CT system in which incident x-rays are divided into six different energy bins was used for multicolor imaging. Au-HDL, an iodine-based contrast agent, and calcium phosphate were imaged in a variety of phantoms. Apolipoprotein E knockout (apo E-KO) mice were used as the model for atherosclerosis. Gold nanoparticles targeted to atherosclerosis (Au-HDL) were intravenously injected at a dose of 500 mg per kilogram of body weight. Iodine-based contrast material was injected 24 hours later, after which the mice were imaged. Wild-type mice were used as controls. Macrophage targeting by Au-HDL was further evaluated by using transmission electron microscopy and confocal microscopy of aorta sections.Multicolor CT enabled differentiation of Au-HDL, iodine-based contrast material, and calcium phosphate in the phantoms. Accumulations of Au-HDL were detected in the aortas of the apo E-KO mice, while the iodine-based contrast agent and the calcium-rich tissue could also be detected and thus facilitated visualization of the vasculature and bones (skeleton), respectively, during a single scanning examination. Microscopy revealed Au-HDL to be primarily localized in the macrophages on the aorta sections; hence, the multicolor CT images provided information about the macrophage burden.Spectral CT used with carefully chosen contrast agents may yield valuable information about atherosclerotic plaque composition.",
        "Purpose To determine the minimum dose of technetium 99m (99mTc) mercaptoacetyltriglycerine (MAG3) needed to perform dynamic renal scintigraphy in the pediatric population without loss of diagnostic quality or accurate quantification of renal function and to investigate whether adaptive noise reduction could help further reduce the minimum dose required. Materials and Methods Approval for this retrospective study was obtained from the institutional review board, with waiver of informed consent. A retrospective review was conducted in 33 pediatric patients consecutively referred for a 99mTc-MAG3 study. In each patient, a 20-minute dynamic study was performed after administration of 7.4 MBq/kg. Binomial subsampling was used to simulate studies performed with 50%, 30%, 20%, and 10% of the administered dose. Four nuclear medicine physicians independently reviewed the original and subsampled images, with and without noise reduction, for image quality. Two observers independently performed a quantitative analysis of renal function. Subjective rater confidence was analyzed by using a logistic regression model, and the quantitative analysis was performed by using the paired Student t test. Results Reducing the administered dose to 30% did not substantially affect image quality, with or without noise reduction. When the dose was reduced to 20%, there was a slight but significant decrease (P = .0074) in image quality, which resolved with noise reduction. Reducing the dose to 10% caused a decrease in image quality (P = .0003) that was not corrected with noise reduction. However, the dose could be reduced to 10% without a substantial change in the quantitative evaluation of renal function independent of the application of noise reduction. Conclusion Decreasing the dose of 99mTc-MAG3 from 7.4 to 2.2 MBq/kg did not compromise image quality. With noise reduction, the dose can be reduced to 1.5 MBq/kg without subjective loss in image quality. The quantitative evaluation of renal function was not substantially altered, even with a theoretical dose as low as 0.74 MBq/kg. \u00a9 RSNA, 2011",
        "To explore the regional patterns of white matter (WM) tract damage in (a) patients with probable Alzheimer disease (AD) and (b) patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and at least one abnormal biomarker and to investigate whether WM damage is related to gray matter (GM) atrophy.This study was approved by the institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained from each participant. Twenty-three patients with AD, 15 patients with aMCI, and 15 healthy control subjects underwent diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging. WM tract damage was investigated by using tract-based spatial statistics, and GM atrophy was measured by using voxel-based morphometry.Compared with control subjects, patients with AD had an increase in mean diffusivity in all major WM tracts studied, including the limbic, cortico-cortical, interhemispheric, and corticospinal tracts. Conversely, fractional anisotropy decreased only in the parahippocampal tract, fornix, and small, inferior parietal regions. In addition, patients with AD showed a widespread increase in axial and radial diffusivity compared with control subjects. Patients with aMCI showed an increase in axial diffusivity only in tracts projecting to the frontal cortex and splenium of the corpus callosum. Significant and anatomically congruent correlations between WM changes and regional GM atrophy were found in patients with AD. Conversely, damage to most WM tracts in patients with aMCI did not correlate with GM atrophy.In AD, the observed patterns of WM abnormalities may reflect the advanced phase of a secondary degenerative process and an association, especially in the early phases of the disease, with primary WM tract damage over and above GM abnormalities.",
        "To compare the diagnostic performance of fluorine 18 ((18)F) fluoride positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) with that of conventional imaging (CT and magnetic resonance [MR] imaging) in evaluating the osseous involvement in meningioma.The study was approved by the ethics committee and institutional review board and was conducted according to the Declarations of Helsinki and Tokyo. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. A retrospective comparative study between (18)F-fluoride PET/CT and conventional imaging was conducted to detect osseous involvement in patients with a verified diagnosis of meningioma. Osseous involvement was verified by using definitive surgery (including drilling or careful sampling of the skull in all patients). The diagnostic performance, determined by calculating the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value ( PPV positive predictive value ), negative predictive value ( NPV negative predictive value ), and accuracy, was assessed.Data sets from a total of 78 patients with proven meningioma were compared. Osseous involvement was histopathologically confirmed in 25 patients (32%). The sensitivity, specificity, PPV positive predictive value , NPV negative predictive value , and accuracy were 92.0%, 86.8%, 76.7%, 95.8%, and 88.5% for (18)F-fluoride PET/CT and 64.0%, 83.0%, 64.0%, 83.0%, and 76.9% for conventional imaging, respectively. The receiver operating characteristic ( ROC receiver operating characteristic ) analysis revealed that the area under the ROC receiver operating characteristic curve ( Az area under the ROC curve ) value of (18)F-fluoride PET/CT was significantly greater than that of conventional imaging (0.965 \u00b1 0.02 [standard error] vs 0.703 \u00b1 0.066 [standard error], P < .0001).An approach using (18)F-fluoride PET/CT improves preoperative detection of osseous involvement. In those without abnormal (18)F-fluoride uptake within the skull, the patient may proceed directly to conventional surgery. However, a positive finding of osseous involvement at (18)F-fluoride PET/CT should prompt confirmation by drilling or sampling of bone.",
        "Purpose To evaluate the early implementation of synthesized two-dimensional (s2D) mammography in a population screened entirely with s2D and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) (referred to as s2D/DBT) and compare recall rates and cancer detection rates to historic outcomes of digital mammography combined with DBT (referred to as digital mammography/DBT) screening. Materials and Methods This was an institutional review board\u2013approved and HIPAA-compliant retrospective interpretation of prospectively acquired data with waiver of informed consent. Compared were recall rates, biopsy rates, cancer detection rates, and radiation dose for 15 571 women screened with digital mammography/DBT from October 1, 2011, to February 28, 2013, and 5366 women screened with s2D/DBT from January 7, 2015, to June 30, 2015. Two-sample z tests of equal proportions were used to determine statistical significance. Results Recall rate for s2D/DBT versus digital mammography/DBT was 7.1% versus 8.8%, respectively (P < .001). Biopsy rate for s2D/DBT versus digital mammography/DBT decreased (1.3% vs 2.0%, respectively; P = .001). There was no significant difference in cancer detection rate for s2D/DBT versus digital mammography/DBT (5.03 of 1000 vs 5.45 of 1000, respectively; P = .72). The average glandular dose was 39% lower in s2D/DBT versus digital mammography/DBT (4.88 mGy vs 7.97 mGy, respectively; P < .001). Conclusion Screening with s2D/DBT in a large urban practice resulted in similar outcomes compared with digital mammography/DBT imaging. Screening with s2D/DBT allowed for the benefits of DBT with a decrease in radiation dose compared with digital mammography/DBT. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016 An earlier incorrect version of this article appeared online.

        "To describe nationwide trends and factors associated with the use of computed tomography (CT) in children visiting emergency departments (EDs) in the United States between 1995 and 2008.This study was exempt from institutional review board oversight. Data from the 1995-2008 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey were used to evaluate the number and percentage of visits associated with CT for patients younger than 18 years. A mean of 7375 visits were sampled each year. Data were subcategorized according to multiple patient and hospital characteristics. The Rao-Scott \u03c7(2) test was performed to determine whether CT use was similar across subpopulations.From 1995 to 2008, the number of pediatric ED visits that included CT examination increased from 0.33 to 1.65 million, a fivefold increase, with a compound annual growth rate of 13.2%. The percentage of visits associated with CT increased from 1.2% to 5.9%, a 4.8-fold increase, with a compound annual growth rate of 12.8%. The number of visits associated with CT at pediatric-focused and non-pediatric-focused EDs increased from 14,895 and 316,133, respectively, in 1995 to 212,716 and 1,438,413, respectively, in 2008. By the end of the study period, top chief complaints among those undergoing CT included head injury, abdominal pain, and headache.Use of CT in children who visit the ED has increased substantially and occurs primarily at non-pediatric-focused facilities. This underscores the need for special attention to this vulnerable population to ensure that imaging is appropriately ordered, performed, and interpreted.",
        "Purpose To evaluate the potential utility of a number of parameters obtained at T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic contrast material\u2013enhanced multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of prostate cancer and assessment of cancer aggressiveness. Materials and Methods In this institutional review board\u2013approved HIPAA-compliant study, multiparametric MR images were acquired with an endorectal coil in 48 patients with prostate cancer (median age, 62.5 years; age range, 44\u201373 years) who subsequently underwent prostatectomy. A radiologist and a pathologist identified 104 regions of interest (ROIs) (61 cancer ROIs, 43 normal ROIs) based on correlation of histologic and MR findings. The 10th percentile and average apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values, T2-weighted signal intensity histogram skewness, and Tofts Ktrans were analyzed, both individually and combined, via linear discriminant analysis, with receiver operating characteristic curve analysis with area under the curve (AUC) as figure of merit, to distinguish cancer foci from normal foci. Spearman rank-order correlation (\u03c1) was calculated between cancer foci Gleason score (GS) and image features. Results AUC (maximum likelihood estimate \u00b1 standard error) values in the differentiation of prostate cancer from normal foci of 10th percentile ADC, average ADC, T2-weighted skewness, and Ktrans were 0.92 \u00b1 0.03, 0.89 \u00b1 0.03, 0.86 \u00b1 0.04, and 0.69 \u00b1 0.04, respectively. The combination of 10th percentile ADC, average ADC, and T2-weighted skewness yielded an AUC value for the same task of 0.95 \u00b1 0.02. GS correlated moderately with 10th percentile ADC (\u03c1 = \u22120.34, P = .008), average ADC (\u03c1 = \u22120.30, P = .02), and Ktrans (\u03c1 = 0.38, P = .004). Conclusion The combination of 10th percentile ADC, average ADC, and T2-weighted skewness with CAD is promising in the differentiation of prostate cancer from normal tissue. ADC image features and Ktrans moderately correlate with GS. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "To evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of ultrasonographically (US) guided percutaneous core biopsy of reticular infiltrations alone without mass in the mesentery and omentum at contrast material-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT).This study was approved by the institutional review board, and the need for obtaining signed informed consent was waived for this retrospective analysis. From March 2004 to May 2009, 45 patients (mean age, 52.3 years; age range, 21-89 years) with reticular infiltrations alone without mass in the mesentery and omentum at contrast-enhanced abdominal CT underwent US-guided percutaneous core biopsy. Twenty-one men and 24 women were included. The area with the severest infiltrations at CT was targeted during real-time US-guided percutaneous biopsy. Biopsy results were compared with the final results of surgery or follow-up. The diagnostic accuracy of US-guided percutaneous biopsy was then calculated.One patient had an insufficient biopsy specimen. Among the 44 patients with sufficient biopsy specimens, 17 patients had malignancy, 12 had tuberculosis, and 15 had nonspecific inflammation. All 29 patients with malignancy and tuberculosis at biopsy had that confirmed with surgery or follow-up results. Two of 15 patients with nonspecific inflammation at percutaneous biopsy were confirmed as having malignancy at surgery and four as having tuberculosis after improvement with empirical antituberculosis therapy. The diagnostic accuracy of US-guided percutaneous biopsy of reticular infiltrations in the mesentery and omentum was 84%; the sensitivity and specificity was, respectively, 89% and 100% for malignancy, 75% and 100% for tuberculosis, and 90% and 83% for nonspecific inflammation.US-guided percutaneous core biopsy is a feasible diagnostic method with high specificity for confirmative diagnosis of reticular infiltrations alone in the mesentery and omentum at contrast-enhanced CT.",
        "To determine whether placement of marking coils at biopsy of small renal neoplasms to facilitate localization at subsequent radiofrequency (RF) ablation is safe and can reduce fluoroscopy time during the ablative procedure. This retrospective study was approved by the hospital institutional review board and was compliant with HIPAA. The requirement to obtain informed consent was waived. A search of the renal RF ablation database (235 patients) identified 23 consecutive patients who had a marking coil placed at biopsy of a renal neoplasm (coil group) and 23 patients who did not have a marking coil placed at biopsy (control group). The patients were matched for tumor characteristics, including size, parenchymal position, location in the kidney, and laterality. All patients underwent subsequent RF ablation. The authors compared computed tomographic (CT) fluoroscopy times and technical success rates between the two groups. Statistical analyses were performed by using a single-tailed paired t test for comparison of CT fluoroscopy times, a two-tailed paired t test for comparison of age and tumor size, and a single-tailed McNemar test for comparison of the technical success rate of ablation. The mean CT fluoroscopy time for the RF ablation procedure was 28 seconds \u00b1 11.7 (standard deviation) for the coil group and 66 seconds \u00b1 85.8 for the control group (P = .025). There was no significant difference in the technical success rates of renal RF ablation. For small renal neoplasms that are poorly visualized at unenhanced CT, placement of a metallic marking coil at biopsy facilitates tumor localization, thus reducing CT fluoroscopy time and radiation dose for subsequent RF ablation procedures.",
        "Purpose To assess whether hepatic transit times (HTTs), as measured with contrast material\u2013enhanced ultrasonography (US), can help predict the nature of focal liver lesions. Materials and Methods The study was approved by the local institutional ethics committee, with written informed patient consent. A total of 402 patients were enrolled in the study. HTT, the time between the appearance of the microbubble contrast agent in the hepatic artery and its appearance in the hepatic vein, was measured in the contrast pulse sequencing mode after injection of a sulphur hexafluoride microbubble US contrast agent. Logistic regression was used to identify factors indicative of the malignant or nonmalignant status of focal liver lesions. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to determine the predictive value of the HTT. Results Observed HTTs for malignant focal liver lesions (mean, 6.2 seconds; range, 2\u201310 seconds) were significantly lower than those for nonmalignant lesions (mean, 9.5 seconds; range, 4\u201325 seconds; P < .001). ROC analysis revealed cutoff values of 7 seconds for HTT and 0.879 for area under the ROC curve. For HTTs of 7 seconds or shorter, hepatic malignancies were detected with a sensitivity of 79%, a specificity of 80%, a positive predictive value of 53%, and a negative predictive value of 93%. No malignant lesions had an HTT longer than 10 seconds. Conclusion HTT alone could be a good predictor for nonmalignancy of focal liver lesions. \u00a9 RSNA, 2010 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/content/256/2/648/suppl/DC1",
        "Purpose To prospectively compare an investigational version of a complex-based chemical shift\u2013based fat fraction magnetic resonance (MR) imaging method with MR spectroscopy for the quantification of hepatic steatosis. Materials and Methods This study was approved by the institutional review board and was HIPAA compliant. Written informed consent was obtained before all studies. Fifty-five patients (31 women, 24 men; age range, 24\u201371 years) were prospectively imaged at 1.5 T with quantitative MR imaging and single-voxel MR spectroscopy, each within a single breath hold. The effects of T2* correction, spectral modeling of fat, and magnitude fitting for eddy current correction on fat quantification with MR imaging were investigated by reconstructing fat fraction images from the same source data with different combinations of error correction. Single-voxel T2-corrected MR spectroscopy was used to measure fat fraction and served as the reference standard. All MR spectroscopy data were postprocessed at a separate institution by an MR physicist who was blinded to MR imaging results. Fat fractions measured with MR imaging and MR spectroscopy were compared statistically to determine the correlation (r2), and the slope and intercept as measures of agreement between MR imaging and MR spectroscopy fat fraction measurements, to determine whether MR imaging can help quantify fat, and examine the importance of T2* correction, spectral modeling of fat, and eddy current correction. Two-sided t tests (significance level, P = .05) were used to determine whether estimated slopes and intercepts were significantly different from 1.0 and 0.0, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity for the classification of clinically significant steatosis were evaluated. Results Overall, there was excellent correlation between MR imaging and MR spectroscopy for all reconstruction combinations. However, agreement was only achieved when T2* correction, spectral modeling of fat, and magnitude fitting for eddy current correction were used (r2 = 0.99; slope \u00b1 standard deviation = 1.00 \u00b1 0.01, P = .77; intercept \u00b1 standard deviation = 0.2% \u00b1 0.1, P = .19). Conclusion T1-independent chemical shift\u2013based water-fat separation MR imaging methods can accurately quantify fat over the entire liver, by using MR spectroscopy as the reference standard, when T2* correction, spectral modeling of fat, and eddy current correction methods are used. \u00a9 RSNA, 2011",
        "Purpose To compare the diagnostic performance of myocardial computed tomographic (CT) perfusion imaging and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) perfusion imaging in the diagnosis of anatomically significant coronary artery disease (CAD) as depicted at invasive coronary angiography. Materials and Methods This study was approved by the institutional review board. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Sixteen centers enrolled 381 patients from November 2009 to July 2011. Patients underwent rest and adenosine stress CT perfusion imaging and rest and either exercise or pharmacologic stress SPECT before and within 60 days of coronary angiography. Images from CT perfusion imaging, SPECT, and coronary angiography were interpreted at blinded, independent core laboratories. The primary diagnostic parameter was the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (Az). Sensitivity and specificity were calculated with use of prespecified cutoffs. The reference standard was a stenosis of at least 50% at coronary angiography as determined with quantitative methods. Results CAD was diagnosed in 229 of the 381 patients (60%). The per-patient sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of CAD (stenosis \u226550%) were 88% (202 of 229 patients) and 55% (83 of 152 patients), respectively, for CT perfusion imaging and 62% (143 of 229 patients) and 67% (102 of 152 patients) for SPECT, with Az values of 0.78 (95% confidence interval: 0.74, 0.82) and 0.69 (95% confidence interval: 0.64, 0.74) (P = .001). The sensitivity of CT perfusion imaging for single- and multivessel CAD was higher than that of SPECT, with sensitivities for left main, three-vessel, two-vessel, and one-vessel disease of 92%, 92%, 89%, and 83%, respectively, for CT perfusion imaging and 75%, 79%, 68%, and 41%, respectively, for SPECT. Conclusion The overall performance of myocardial CT perfusion imaging in the diagnosis of anatomic CAD (stenosis \u226550%), as demonstrated with the Az, was higher than that of SPECT and was driven in part by the higher sensitivity for left main and multivessel disease. \u00a9 RSNA, 2014",

        "Purpose To determine whether intravenous low-osmolality iodinated contrast material is associated with post\u2013computed tomography (CT) acute kidney injury (AKI). Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval was obtained and patient consent waived for this HIPAA-compliant retrospective study. CT examinations performed over a 10-year period in adult inpatients with sufficient serum creatinine (SCr) data were identified. A one-to-one propensity-matched matched cohort analysis with multivariate analysis of effects was performed with post-CT AKI as the primary outcome measure (10 121 unenhanced and 10 121 intravenous contrast-enhanced CT examinations in 20 242 patients). Propensity matching was performed with respect to likelihood of patient receiving intravenous contrast material (36 tested covariates). The primary endpoint was post-CT AKI by using Acute Kidney Injury Network SCr criteria; the secondary endpoint was post-CT AKI by using traditional SCr criteria for contrast material\u2013induced nephrotoxicity (CIN; SCr increase \u22650.5 mg/dL [44.20\u03bcmol/L] or \u226525%). Multivariate subgroup threshold analysis was performed (SCr <1.5 [<132.60 \u03bcmol/L]; \u22651.5 to \u22652.0 mg/dL [\u2265132.60 to \u2265176.80 \u03bcmol/L]) and adjusted for assigned propensity scores. Results Intravenous low-osmolality iodinated contrast material had a significant effect on the development of post-CT AKI for patients with pre-CT SCr levels of 1.6 mg/dL (141.44 \u03bcmol/L) or greater (odds ratio, 1.45; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11, 1.89;P = .007). This effect strengthened as pre-CT SCr increased. Patients with stable SCr less than 1.5 mg/dL (132.60 \u03bcmol/L) were not at risk for developing CIN (P = .25, power > 95%). Both endpoints demonstrated similar results (eg, SCr \u22651.6 mg/dL [141.44 \u03bcmol/L] by using traditional CIN criteria: odds ratio, 1.64; 95% CI: 1.18, 2.28; P = .003). Post-CT AKI was prevalent in both the unenhanced and contrast-enhanced CT subgroups, and it increased with increases in pre-CT SCr. Many risk factors contributed to development of post-CT AKI, regardless of iodinated contrast material. Conclusion Intravenous low-osmolality iodinated contrast material is a nephrotoxic risk factor, but not in patients with a stable SCr level less than 1.5 mg/dL. Many factors other than contrast material can affect post-CT AKI rates. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "To optimize intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging by estimating the effects of diffusion gradient polarity and breathing acquisition scheme on image quality, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), IVIM parameters, and parameter reproducibility, as well as to investigate the potential of IVIM in the detection of hepatic fibrosis.In this institutional review board-approved prospective study, 20 subjects (seven healthy volunteers, 13 patients with hepatitis C virus infection; 14 men, six women; mean age, 46 years) underwent IVIM DW imaging with four sequences: (a) respiratory-triggered (RT) bipolar (BP) sequence, (b) RT monopolar (MP) sequence, (c) free-breathing (FB) BP sequence, and (d) FB MP sequence. Image quality scores were assessed for all sequences. A biexponential analysis with the Bayesian method yielded true diffusion coefficient (D), pseudodiffusion coefficient (D*), and perfusion fraction (PF) in liver parenchyma. Mixed-model analysis of variance was used to compare image quality, SNR, IVIM parameters, and interexamination variability between the four sequences, as well as the ability to differentiate areas of liver fibrosis from normal liver tissue.Image quality with RT sequences was superior to that with FB acquisitions (P = .02) and was not affected by gradient polarity. SNR did not vary significantly between sequences. IVIM parameter reproducibility was moderate to excellent for PF and D, while it was less reproducible for D*. PF and D were both significantly lower in patients with hepatitis C virus than in healthy volunteers with the RT BP sequence (PF = 13.5% \u00b1 5.3 [standard deviation] vs 9.2% \u00b1 2.5, P = .038; D = [1.16 \u00b1 0.07] \u00d7 10(-3) mm(2)/sec vs [1.03 \u00b1 0.1] \u00d7 10(-3) mm(2)/sec, P = .006).The RT BP DW imaging sequence had the best results in terms of image quality, reproducibility, and ability to discriminate between healthy and fibrotic liver with biexponential fitting.",
        "History A 6-year-old girl presented with bilateral hearing loss. Her otologic, birth, and family histories were limited, given that she was adopted, but her parents reported that she had had difficulty hearing and speaking ever since they adopted her at 2 years of age. Her parents denied a history of acute otitis media, otorrhea, otalgia, vertigo, autophony, or tinnitus since her adoption. At 2.5 years of age, a diagnosis of hearing loss was made, and she was given hearing aids. Her parents believed that she had been doing well with both receptive and expressive language since she had received the hearing aids. At examination, she had small bilateral preauricular skin tags and normal pinna. Her external auditory canals were of a normal caliber bilaterally, with no otorrhea or lesions. The tympanic membranes were translucent and mobile at pneumatic otoscopy. There was no evidence of a middle ear lesion, nor was there a Schwartz sign. She had no nystagmus or vertigo at pneumatic otoscopy. Audiometry was performed and revealed moderate to severe conductive hearing loss bilaterally, with a mixed component present at 2000 KHz. She had normal bilateral middle ear pressure at tympanometry. Thin-section computed tomography (CT) of the temporal bone was performed.",
        "Purpose To investigate associations between computed tomographic (CT) features of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and mutations in VHL, PBRM1, SETD2, KDM5C, or BAP1 genes.

The study was HIPAA compliant. Three radiologists independently reviewed pretreatment CT images of all clear cell RCCs without knowledge of their genomic profile. One radiologist measured largest diameter and enhancement parameters of each clear cell RCC. Associations between CT features and mutations in VHL, PBRM1, SETD2, KDM5C, and BAP1 genes were tested by using the Fisher exact test. Associations between mutations and size and enhancement were assessed by using the independent t test. Interreader agreement was calculated by using the Fleiss \u03ba. Results Mutation frequencies among clear cell RCCs were as follows: VHL, 53.2% (124 of 233); PBRM1, 28.8% (67 of 233); SETD2, 7.3% (17 of 233); KDM5C, 6.9% (16 of 233); and BAP1, 6.0% (14 of 233). Mutations of VHL were significantly associated with well-defined tumor margins (P = .013), nodular tumor enhancement (P = .021), and gross appearance of intratumoral vascularity (P = .018). Mutations of KDM5C and BAP1 were significantly associated with evidence of renal vein invasion (P = .022 and .046, respectively). The genotype of solid clear cell RCC differed significantly from the genotype of multicystic clear cell RCC. While mutations of SETD2, KDM5C, and BAP1 were absent in multicystic clear cell RCC, mutations of VHL (P = .016) and PBRM1 (P = .017) were significantly more common among solid clear cell RCC. Interreader agreement for CT feature assessments ranged from substantial to excellent (\u03ba = 0.791\u20130.912). Conclusion This preliminary radiogenomics analysis of clear cell RCC revealed associations between CT features and underlying mutations that warrant further investigation and validation. \u00a9RSNA, 2013 Online supplemental material is available for this article."
