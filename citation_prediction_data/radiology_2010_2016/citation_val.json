        "To evaluate the feasibility of using computed tomographic (CT) colonography for preoperative examination of the proximal colon after metallic stent placement in patients with acute colon obstruction caused by colorectal cancer.Institutional review board approval was obtained, and patient informed consent was waived. Fifty patients (mean age +/- standard deviation, 58.5 years +/- 11.7), who demonstrated no postprocedural complication after successful placement of self-expandable metallic stents to treat acute colon obstruction caused by cancer, underwent CT colonography 1-43 days (median, 5 days) after stent placement. CT colonography was performed after cathartic preparation by using magnesium citrate (n = 20) or sodium phosphate (n = 3), combined with oral bisacodyl, or by using polyethylene glycol (n = 27). Fecal/fluid tagging was achieved by using 100 mL of meglumine diatrizoate. The colon was distended by means of pressure-monitored CO(2) insufflation. The sensitivity and specificity of CT colonography in evaluating the colon proximal to the stent and CT colonography-related complications were assessed. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for proportional data.Per-lesion and per-patient sensitivities of CT colonography for lesions 6 mm or larger in diameter in the colon proximal to the stent were 85.7% (12 of 14 lesions; 95% CI: 58.8%, 97.2%) and 90% (nine of 10 patients; 95% CI: 57.4%, 99.9%), respectively. CT colonography depicted all synchronous cancers (two lesions) and advanced adenomas (five lesions). Per-patient specificity for lesions 6 mm and larger in the proximal colon was 85.7% (18 of 21 patients; 95% CI: 64.5%, 95.9%). CT colonography did not generate any false diagnosis of synchronous cancer. False-positive findings at CT colonography did not result in a change in surgical plan for any patients. No CT colonography-associated stent dislodgment/migration or colonic perforation occurred in any patient (95% CI: 0%, 6.2%).CT colonography is a safe and useful method for preoperative examination of the proximal colon after metallic stent placement in patients with acute colon obstruction caused by cancer.

        "To evaluate and describe pancreatic involvement by using multidetector computed tomography (CT) in patients with a diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT).Institutional review board approval was obtained, and all patients provided informed consent. Across 12 months, all consecutive adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of HHT referred to our pluridisciplinary HHT center for evaluation were enrolled prospectively in the study and underwent contrast material-enhanced multidetector CT of the abdomen. Pancreatic telangiectases and arteriovenous fistulas were noted, and their characteristics were described. Genetic mutation was also investigated.Thirty-five patients (19 women, 16 men; mean age, 48.4 years) were included. All patients were asymptomatic. A genetic mutation was identified in 28 (80%) patients, including endoglin in 16 (57%), activin type-II-like receptor kinase 1 (ALK1) in 11 (39%), and SMAD4 in one (4%). Eleven (31%) patients exhibited pancreatic involvement. Fifty-four percent of patients with ALK1 mutation had pancreatic involvement. Twenty-three pancreatic telangiectases were identified during the arterial phase in nine patients. Seven pancreatic arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) were identified in four patients.Pancreatic involvement commonly is found in patients with HHT (31% in our study), mainly in patients with ALK1 mutation; pancreatic telangiectases or AVMs are only diagnosed duringthe arterial phase at multidetector CT.",
        "Purpose To determine the feasibility of computed tomography (CT)-based dynamic myocardial perfusion imaging for the detection of hemodynamically significant coronary artery stenosis, as defined with fractional flow reserve (FFR). Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval and informed patient consent were obtained before patient enrollment in the study. The study was HIPAA compliant. Subjects who were suspected of having or were known to have coronary artery disease underwent electrocardiographically triggered dynamic stress myocardial perfusion imaging. FFR measurement was performed within all main coronary arteries with a luminal narrowing of 50%\u201385%. Estimated myocardial blood flow (MBF) was derived from CT images by using a model-based parametric deconvolution method for 16 myocardial segments and was related to hemodynamically significant coronary artery stenosis with an FFR of 0.75 or less in a blinded fashion. Conventional measures of diagnostic accuracy were derived, and discriminatory power analysis was performed by using logistic regression analysis. Results Of 36 enrolled subjects, 33 (mean age, 68.1 years \u00b1 10 [standard deviation]; 25 [76%] men, eight [24%] women) completed the study protocol. An MBF cut point of 75 mL/100 mL/min provided the highest discriminatory power (C statistic, 0.707; P <.001). While the diagnostic accuracy of CT for the detection of anatomically significant coronary artery stenosis (>50%) was high, it was low for the detection of hemodynamically significant stenosis (positive predictive value [PPV] per coronary segment, 49%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 36%, 60%). With use of estimated MBF to reclassify lesions depicted with CT angiography, 30 of 70 (43%) coronary lesions were graded as not hemodynamically significant, which significantly increased PPV to 78% (95% CI: 61%, 89%; P = .02). The presence of a coronary artery stenosis with a corresponding MBF less than 75 mL/100 mL/min had a high risk for hemodynamic significance (odds ratio, 86.9; 95% CI:17.6, 430.4). Conclusion Dynamic CT-based stress myocardial perfusion imaging may allow detection of hemodynamically significant coronary artery stenosis. \u00a9 RSNA, 2011 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.11110638/-/DC1",
        "Purpose To evaluate the hybrid approach in a large population of patients with melanoma in the head and neck, on the trunk, or on an extremity who were scheduled for sentinel node (SN) biopsy. Materials and Methods This prospective study was approved by the institutional review board. Between March 2010 and March 2013, 104 patients with a melanoma, including 48 women (average age, 54.3 years; range, 18.5\u201387.4 years) and 56 men (average age, 55.2 years; range, 22.4\u201377.4 years) (P = .76) were enrolled after obtaining written informed consent. Following intradermal hybrid tracer administration, lymphoscintigraphy and single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography were performed. Blue dye was intradermally injected prior to the start of the surgical operation (excluding patients with a facial melanoma). Intraoperatively, SNs were initially pursued by using gamma tracing followed by fluorescence imaging (FI) and, when applicable, blue-dye detection. A portable gamma camera was used to confirm SN removal. Collected data included number and location of the preoperatively and intraoperatively identified SNs and the intraoperative number of SNs that were radioactive, fluorescent, and blue. A two-sample test for equality of proportions was performed to evaluate differences in intraoperative SN visualization through FI and blue-dye detection. Results Preoperative imaging revealed 2.4 SNs (range, 1\u20136) per patient. Intraoperatively, 93.8% (286 of 305) of the SNs were radioactive, 96.7% (295 of 305) of the SNs were fluorescent, while only 61.7% (116 of 188) of the SNs stained blue (P < .0001). FI was of value for identification of near-injection-site SNs (two patients), SNs located in complex anatomic areas (head and neck [28 patients]), and SNs that failed to accumulate blue dye (19 patients). Conclusion The hybrid tracer enables both preoperative SN mapping and intraoperative SN identification in melanoma patients. In the setup of this study, optical identification of the SNs through the fluorescent signature of the hybrid tracer was superior compared with blue dye\u2013based SN visualization. \u00a9 RSNA, 2014 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To compare the diagnostic performances of three T1-weighted 3.0-T magnetic resonance (MR) sequences at carotid intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH) imaging, with histo logic analysis as the reference standard.Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained for this HIPAA-compliant study. Twenty patients scheduled for carotid endarterectomy underwent 3.0-T carotid MR imaging, including two-dimensional fast spin-echo, three-dimensional time-of-flight (TOF), and three-dimensional magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient-echo (RAGE) sequences. Two reviewers blinded to the histologic findings assessed the presence, area, and signal intensity of IPH with each sequence. Detection statistics (sensitivity, specificity, and Cohen kappa values) and agreement between area measurements (Pearson correlation coefficient [r] values) were calculated for each sequence.When all 231 available MR sections were included for analysis, the magnetization-prepared RAGE (kappa = 0.53) and fast spin-echo (kappa = 0.42) sequences yielded moderate agreement between MR and histologic measurements, while the TOF sequence yielded fair agreement (k = 0.33). However, when 47 sections with either small IPHs or heavily calcified IPHs were excluded, sensitivity, specificity, and kappa values, respectively, were 80%, 97%, and 0.80 for magnetization-prepared RAGE imaging; 70%, 92%, and 0.63 for fast spin-echo imaging; and 56%, 96%, and 0.57 for TOF imaging. MR imaging-histologic analysis correlation for IPH area was highest with magnetization-prepared RAGE imaging (r = 0.813), followed by TOF (r = 0.745) and fast spin-echo (r = 0.497) imaging. The capability of these three sequences for IPH detection appeared to be in good agreement with the quantitative contrast of IPH versus background plaque tissue.The magnetization-prepared RAGE sequence, as compared with the fast spin-echo and TOF sequences, demonstrated higher diagnostic capability for the detection and quantification of IPH. Potential limitations of 3.0-T IPH MR imaging are related to hemorrhage size and coexisting calcification.",
        "Purpose To evaluate the diagnostic potential of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM)\u2013derived parameters for differentiation of common pancreatic tumors, chronic pancreatitis, and normal pancreas and for characterization of the malignancy potential of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs). Materials and Methods The institutional review board approved this retrospective study, and informed consent was waived. Ninety-three consecutive patients with surgically resected and pathologically confirmed pancreatic tumors (39 pancreatic adenocarcinomas [PACs], 17 neuroendocrine tumors [NETs], and 37 IPMNs), seven patients with chronic pancreatitis, and 26 patients with a normal pancreas were included in this study. All patients underwent pancreatic 3.0-T magnetic resonance imaging, including IVIM diffusion-weighted imaging with 10 b values used (from 0 to 1000 sec/mm2). The ADC, slow component of diffusion (Dslow), incoherent microcirculation (Dfast), and perfusion fraction (f) were calculated. Steel-Dwass and Mann-Whitney U tests were used for comparison. The diagnostic performance of the parameters was evaluated by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis with Bonferroni correction. Results Among ADC- and IVIM-derived parameters, Dfast and f values of PACs were significantly lower than those of normal pancreas, chronic pancreatitis, and NETs (all P < .05 in post hoc analyses). For differentiation of PACs from NETs, f and Dfast showed a significant difference (P < .0001 for both) and were more useful parameters than ADC and Dslow in ROC analysis (all P < .05). Malignant IPMNs had significantly lower ADC and Dslow values and higher Dfast and f values when compared with benign IPMNs (all P < .05). In ROC analysis, f showed the highest area under the ROC curve value for distinguishing malignant from benign IPMNs. Conclusion IVIM-derived perfusion-related parameters could be helpful for the differentiation of common malignant tumors in the pancreas and for distinguishing malignant from benign IPMNs. Dfast and f were more valuable parameters in the differentiation of PACs from NETs than were ADC and Dslow. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To compare radiologists' diagnostic accuracy and recall rates for breast tomosynthesis combined with digital mammography versus digital mammography alone.Institutional review board approval was obtained at each accruing institution. Participating women gave written informed consent. Mediolateral oblique and craniocaudal digital mammographic and tomosynthesis images of both breasts were obtained from 1192 subjects. Two enriched reader studies were performed to compare digital mammography with tomosynthesis against digital mammography alone. Study 1 comprised 312 cases (48 cancer cases) with images read by 12 radiologists; study 2, 312 cases (51 cancer cases) with 15 radiologists. Study 1 readers recorded only that an abnormality requiring recall was present; study 2 readers had additional training and recorded both lesion type and location. Diagnostic accuracy was compared with receiver operating characteristic analysis. Recall rates of noncancer cases, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values determined by analyzing Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System scores were compared for the two methods.Diagnostic accuracy for combined tomosynthesis and digital mammography was superior to that of digital mammography alone. Average difference in area under the curve in study 1 was 7.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.7%, 10.8%; P < .001) and in study 2 was 6.8% (95% CI: 4.1%, 9.5%; P < .001). All 27 radiologists increased diagnostic accuracy with addition of tomosynthesis. Recall rates for noncancer cases for all readers significantly decreased with addition of tomosynthesis (range, 6%-67%; P < .001 for 25 readers, P < .03 for all readers). Increased sensitivity was largest for invasive cancers: 15% and 22% in studies 1 and 2 versus 3% for in situ cancers in both studies.Addition of tomosynthesis to digital mammography offers the dual benefit of significantly increased diagnostic accuracy and significantly reduced recall rates for noncancer cases.http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.12120674/-/DC1.",
        "To determine whether C-reactive protein is associated with the type of coronary plaque seen at computed tomographic (CT) angiography.The institutional review board approved this retrospective study, and the need for informed consent was waived. C-reactive protein levels were measured in 2653 asymptomatic subjects (mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 54.7 years \u00b1 9.2; 1811 men) who underwent self-referred coronary CT angiography as part of a general health checkup. The presence of coronary plaque, plaque type (calcified, mixed calcified, or noncalcified), stenosis degree, and number of involved segments were evaluated. Subjects with one type of plaque (calcified plaque, mixed plaque, and noncalcified plaque groups) and two or more types of plaque (multiple lesions group) were analyzed separately. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between increasing C-reactive protein levels and plaque type.Coronary plaque was found in 1150 of the 2653 subjects (43.3%): calcified plaque (n = 604, 22.8%), mixed plaque (n = 67, 2.5%), noncalcified plaque (n = 208, 7.8%), and multiple lesions (n = 271, 10.2%). The C-reactive protein cutoff value of the fourth quartile was 1.2 mg/L (11.4 nmol/L), and all types of coronary plaque were increased in the higher quartile of the C-reactive protein levels. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that a higher C-reactive protein level was an independent predictor for the presence of noncalcified plaque (fourth vs first quartile group, odds ratio = 1.70, P = .025) and significant (50% and higher) coronary stenosis (odds ratio = 1.76, P = .020) after adjustment for traditional risk factors for coronary artery disease.C-reactive protein is associated with noncalcified coronary arterial plaque, as seen at coronary CT angiography in asymptomatic patients after adjustment for traditional risk factors.",

One hundred twenty-five patients (median age, 63 years; interquartile range, 53\u201371 years) with a diagnosis of HCC and indications for hepatic resection were included. Two observers independently reviewed radiologic images to evaluate the following features for MVI: maximum diameter, number of lesions, tumor margins, TTPVI, and peritumoral enhancement. Interobserver agreement was checked, and diagnostic accuracy of radiologic features was investigated. Results The total number of HCC nodules was 140. Large tumor size, nonsmooth tumor margins, TTPVI, and peritumoral enhancement were significantly related to the presence of MVI (P < .05 in all cases and for both observers). Multinodularity was not significantly related (P = .158). Moreover, the diagnostic accuracy of the three \"worrisome\" radiologic features (nonsmooth tumor margins, peritumoral enhancement, and TTPVI) was associated with tumor size: The negative predictive value of the absence of worrisome features decreased from 0.84 for observer 1 and 0.91 for observer 2 for tumors smaller than 2 cm to 0.56 and 0.71, respectively, for tumors larger than 5 cm, whereas the presence of all three worrisome features returned to a positive predictive value of 0.95 for observer 1 and 0.96 for observer 2 independent of tumor size, with no significant interobserver differences (P > .10). Conclusion \"Worrisome\" imaging features, such as tumor dimension, nonsmooth tumor margins, peritumoral enhancement, and TTPVI, have high accuracy in the prediction of MVI in HCC. \u00a9 RSNA, 2015 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To establish an image-based M1 category subdivision system for personalized prognosis prediction and treatment planning in patients with metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Materials and Methods A total of 1172 patients with metachronous metastasic NPC were retrospectively enrolled (the dataset is from Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center for derivation, and the combined datasets are from Guangzhou Medical University Cancer Center and the Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University for validation). The Ethics Committee of the three centers approved this study. A general subdivision system of the M1 category was established on the basis of the most influential metastatic features for overall survival (OS). The following multilevel subdivision system for precise subdivision of the M1 category was designed: M [number of locations]-Location [number of lesions], with B indicating bone, L indicating the lung, H indicating the liver, and N indicating a node. The correlation of the M1 subdivisions with OS was determined with Cox regression. The best treatment response was assessed with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 guidelines and modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria. Results Multivariate analysis in the derivation cohort showed that the number of metastatic lesions (multiple or single), the number of metastatic locations (multiple or single), liver involvement, and bone involvement were independent prognostic factors for OS. In general, subdividing the cohort by the number of metastatic lesions and the number of metastatic locations resulted in three subcategories of differential OS: M1a, a single lesion in a single organ or location; M1b, multiple lesions in a single organ or location; and M1c, metastases in multiple locations (for M1b vs M1a, hazard ratio [HR] = 2.28, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.71, 3.05; for M1c vs M1a, HR = 3.65, 95% CI: 2.75, 4.85); these subdivisions were externally validated. The multilevel subdivision system could be further used to discriminate among subgroups of differential OS under the M1b subcategory. Findings from analysis of multilevel subgroups suggested that patients with a single metastatic lesion (M1-B1, M1-L1, M1-H1, M1-N1) or two lesions in the liver only (M1-H2) had high rates of complete response (CR) or complete surgical resection (CSR) and 3-year OS after treatment (CR plus CSR rates >30%, and 3-year OS rates >50%); there were high 3-year OS rates (>50%) in patients with stage M1-B2, M1-L2, or M1-H3 disease but relatively low rates of CR or CSR. Conclusion Use of the multilevel M1 subdivision system in patients with NPC could facilitate more precise prognosis prediction and better identification of patients who will respond well to treatment than the conventional subdivision strategy.

        "Purpose To identify differences in radiologic assessment methods and determine optimal imaging criteria for response evaluation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients treated with chemoembolization. Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval was obtained, and patient informed consent was waived. The present study included 332 patients with intermediate stage HCC and Child-Pugh A cirrhosis who underwent serial chemoembolization. All measurable target lesions of 1 cm or larger in diameter were uni- and bidimensionally measured both at baseline and during follow-up. Intermodel agreement among the guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO), Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), and modified RECIST (mRECIST) were examined. The most reliable model was selected on the basis of the correlation with survival prediction. Results The \u03ba values of comparisons among WHO, RECIST, and mRECIST guidelines were less than 0.20, whereas the \u03ba value for the comparison of EASL and mRECIST guidelines was 0.94. In patients with a partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD), compared with patients with a complete response (CR), hazard ratios (HRs) for survival were 2.99 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.14, 4.17), 3.49 (95% CI: 1.71, 7.10), and 15.63 (95% CI: 9.51, 25.69), respectively, for EASL criteria. In patients with a PR, SD, or PD, compared with patients with a CR, the HRs were 2.75 (95% CI: 1.96, 3.87), 6.32 (95% CI: 3.67, 10.90), and 16.06 (95% CI: 9.76, 26.43), respectively, for mRECIST guidelines (P < .001). The C index for the multivariate model was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.79) for both EASL and mRECIST guidelines, thus exhibiting satisfactory capability to help predict survival. The Cox regression model revealed that both mRECIST and EASL guidelines were independent predictors of overall survival (P < .001 for both). Conclusion The enhancement models more accurately helped predict long-term survival in HCC patients treated with chemoembolization. \u00a9 RSNA, 2011",
        "To review the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings in eight patients who developed marrow lesions after undergoing physiotherapy with use of ultrasound diathermy.The authors retrospectively reviewed the medical charts and MR images of eight patients (six women and two men aged 22-69 years) who received ultrasound diathermy treatment for a variety of soft tissue injuries involving primarily the knee, shoulder, and wrist. All patients underwent MR imaging without the use of intravenous gadolinium-based contrast material. The institutional review board approved the study, and the requirement to obtain informed consent was waived.MR imaging of all patients revealed subcortical rim or arc lesions with low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images, without involvement of the deeper aspect of the bone marrow. The imaging features of the lesions were similar to those of focal osteonecrosis. Follow-up MR imaging performed in three patients approximately 2-3 months after cessation of ultrasound therapy revealed resolution of the bone lesions. Symptoms resolved in all patients.This study demonstrated that ultrasound diathermy may produce an osseous injury. The abnormality itself was usually mild and transient, with apparent full recovery after termination of therapy.",
        "To test the hypothesis that an image noise reduction algorithm designed for digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in interventional neuroradiology enables a reduction in the patient entrance dose by a factor of 4 while maintaining image quality.This clinical prospective study was approved by the local ethics committee, and all 20 adult patients provided informed consent. DSA was performed with the default reference DSA program, a quarter-dose DSA program with modified acquisition parameters (to reduce patient radiation dose exposure), and a real-time noise-reduction algorithm. Two consecutive biplane DSA data sets were acquired in each patient. The dose-area product (DAP) was calculated for each image and compared. A randomized, blinded, offline reading study was conducted to show noninferiority of the quarter-dose image sets. Overall, 40 samples per treatment group were necessary to acquire 80% power, which was calculated by using a one-sided \u03b1 level of 2.5%.The mean DAP with the quarter-dose program was 25.3% \u00b1 0.8 of that with the reference program. The median overall image quality scores with the reference program were 9, 13, and 12 for readers 1, 2, and 3, respectively. These scores increased slightly to 12, 15, and 12, respectively, with the quarter-dose program imaging chain.In DSA, a change in technique factors combined with a real-time noise-reduction algorithm will reduce the patient entrance dose by 75%, without a loss of image quality.",
        "Purpose To retrospectively evaluate the diagnostic performance of power Doppler ultrasonography (US) in depicting vascularity and to determine whether the combination of vascularity and suspicious gray-scale US features is more useful in predicting thyroid malignancy than are gray-scale features alone. Materials and Methods This was an institutional review board-approved retrospective study, with waiver of informed consent. A total of 1083 thyroid nodules in 1024 patients (median age, 51 years; range, 16\u201383 years), consisting of 886 women (median age, 50 years; range, 16\u201383 years) and 138 men (median age, 53 years; range, 19\u201374 years), were included. Nodules with marked hypoechogenicity, noncircumscribed margins, microcalcifications, and taller-than-wide shape were classified as suspicious according to gray-scale US criteria. Vascularity was classified as none, peripheral, and intranodular. The diagnostic performance of gray-scale and power Doppler US features was compared and classified as follows: criterion 1, any single suspicious gray-scale US feature; criterion 2, addition of any vascularity as one of the suspicious features to criterion 1; criterion 3, addition of peripheral vascularity to criterion 1; criterion 4, addition of intranodular vascularity to criterion 1; criterion 5, addition of no vascularity to criterion 1; criterion 6, American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and Associazione Medici Endocrinology guidelines\u2014all hypoechoic nodules with at least one of the following US features: irregular margins, intranodular vascular spots, taller-than-wide shape, or microcalcifications. Results Of 1083 nodules, 814 were benign and 269 were malignant. Intranodular vascularity was frequently seen in benign nodules and no vascularity was more frequent in malignant nodules (P < .0001, respectively). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (Az) of criterion 1 was superior (Az = 0.851) to that of criteria 2 (Az = 0.634), 3 (Az = 0.752), 4 (Az = 0.733), 5 (Az = 0.718), and 6 (Az = 0.806) (P < .0001). Conclusion Vascularity itself or a combination of vascularity and gray-scale US features was not as useful as the use of suspicious gray-scale US features alone for predicting thyroid malignancy. \u00a9 RSNA, 2010",
        "Background: Sonographic imaging of the pancreas provides information with regards to pancreatic size, echotexture and ductal morphology which are important in the assessment of pancreas in both normal and morbid conditions. There is paucity of literature on these normal values in this environment.\r\nAim and Objective: To determine the normal pancreatic sizes and ductal dimensions among normal adults using Ultrasound in Maiduguri, North-eastern Nigeria.Materials and methods: This was a prospective study which spanned over a period of four months from January to April 2013 on 400 consenting normal adults.\r\nResults: the study revealed normal adults mean pancreatic head, body, tail and duct dimensions of 2.13\u00b123cm, 1.51\u00b10.19cm, 1.80\u00b10.18cm and 2.12\u00b11.42mm respectively.

No correlation was noted between all the pancreatic dimensions with age.\r\nConclusion: The result of the study will be used as a baseline data for the assessment of pancreatic diseases.",
        "To evaluate the diagnostic yield of recommended chest computed tomography (CT) prompted by abnormalities detected on outpatient chest radiographic images.This HIPAA-compliant study had institutional review board approval; informed consent was waived. Reports of all outpatient chest radiographic examinations performed at a large academic center during 2008 (n = 29 138) were queried to identify studies that included a recommendation for a chest CT imaging. The radiology information system was queried for these patients to determine if a chest CT examination was obtained within 1 year of the index radiographic examination that contained the recommendation. For chest CT examinations obtained within 1 year of the index chest radiographic examination and that met inclusion criteria, chest CT images were reviewed to determine if there was an abnormality that corresponded to the chest radiographic finding that prompted the recommendation. All corresponding abnormalities were categorized as clinically relevant or not clinically relevant, based on whether further work-up or treatment was warranted. Groups were compared by using t test and Fisher exact test with a Bonferroni correction applied for multiple comparisons.There were 4.5% (1316 of 29138 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 4.3%, 4.8%]) of outpatient chest radiographic examinations that contained a recommendation for chest CT examination, and increasing patient age (P < .001) and positive smoking history (P = .001) were associated with increased likelihood of a recommendation for chest CT examination. Of patients within this subset who met inclusion criteria, 65.4% (691 of 1057 [95% CI: 62.4%, 68.2%) underwent a chest CT examination within the year after the index chest radiographic examination. Clinically relevant corresponding abnormalities were present on chest CT images in 41.4% (286 of 691 [95% CI: 37.7%, 45.2%]) of cases, nonclinically relevant corresponding abnormalities in 20.6% (142 of 691 [95% CI: 17.6%, 23.8%]) of cases, and no corresponding abnormalities in 38.1% (263 of 691 [95% CI: 34.4%, 41.8%]) of cases. Newly diagnosed, biopsy-proven malignancies were detected in 8.1% (56 of 691 [95% CI: 6.2%, 10.4%]) of cases.A radiologist recommendation for chest CT to evaluate an abnormal finding on an outpatient chest radiographic examination has a high yield of clinically relevant findings.",
        "Purpose To determine the individual and combined performance of magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopic imaging and diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging at 3 T in the in vivo assessment of prostate cancer aggressiveness by using histopathologically defined regions of interest on radical prostatectomy specimens to define the prostate cancer regions to be investigated. Materials and Methods The local institutional ethics review board approved this retrospective study and waived the informed consent requirement. Fifty-four patients with biopsy-proved prostate cancer underwent clinical MR spectroscopic imaging followed by prostatectomy. Guided by the histopathologic map, all spectroscopy voxels that contained tumor tissue were selected, and metabolite ratios (choline [Cho] plus creatine [Cr]-to-citrate [Cit] and Cho/Cr ratios) were derived. For each spectroscopic voxel, 25th percentile apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the region corresponding to that voxel was determined, representing the most aberrant tumor part on the ADC map, which was often smaller than spectroscopic imaging voxels. Maximum metabolic ratios and minimum 25th percentile ADC of each tumor were related to tumor aggressiveness and were used to differentiate aggressiveness classes. A logistic regression model (LRM) was used to combine data from both modalities. Results Significant correlation was found between aggressiveness classes and maximum Cho+Cr/Cit ratio (\u03c1 = 0.36), maximum Cho/Cr ratio (\u03c1 = 0.35), and minimum 25th percentile ADC (\u03c1 = \u22120.63) in the peripheral zone (PZ). In the transition zone (TZ), the correlation was significant for only Cho+Cr/Cit and Cho/Cr ratios (\u03c1 = 0.58 and \u03c1 = 0.60, respectively). For differentiation between aggressiveness classes, LRM use did not result in significantly improved differentiation over any individual variables. Conclusion These findings enabled confirmation that MR spectroscopic imaging and DW imaging offer potential for in vivo noninvasive assessment of prostate cancer aggressiveness, and both modalities have comparable performance. The combination did not result in better performance. Nonetheless, the better performances of metabolite ratios in the TZ and of ADCs in the PZ suggest that they have complementary value. \u00a9 RSNA, 2012",
        "To test the image features that may be useful in predicting the visually lossless thresholds (VLTs) of body computed tomographic (CT) images for Joint Photographic Experts Group 2000 (JPEG2000) compression.The institutional review board approved this study, with a waiver of informed patient consent. One hundred body CT studies obtained in different patients by using five scanning protocols were obtained, and 100 images, each of which was selected from each of the 100 studies, were collected. Five radiologists independently determined the VLT of each image for JPEG2000 compression by using the QUEST algorithm. The 100 images were randomly divided into two data sets-the training set (50 images) and the testing set (50 images)-and the division was repeated 200 times. For each of the 200 divisions, a multiple linear regression model was constructed on a training set and tested on a testing set regarding each of five image features-standard deviation of image intensity, image entropy, relative percentage of low-frequency (LF) energy, variation in high-frequency (HF) energy, and visual complexity-as independent variables and considering the VLTs determined with the median value of the radiologists' responses as a dependent variable. The root mean square residual and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for the 200 divisions between the VLTs predicted by the models and those determined by radiologists were compared between the models by using repeated-measures analysis of variance with post-hoc comparisons.Mean root-mean-square residuals for multiple linear regression models constructed with variation in HF energy (1.20 \u00b1 0.10 [standard deviation]) and visual complexity (1.09 \u00b1 0.07) were significantly lower than those for standard deviation of image intensity (1.65 \u00b1 0.13), image entropy (1.63 \u00b1 0.14), and relative percentage of LF energy (1.58 \u00b1 0.12) (P < .01). ICCs for variation in HF energy (0.64 \u00b1 0.05) and visual complexity (0.71 \u00b1 0.04) were significantly higher than those for standard deviation of image intensity (0.04 \u00b1 0.02), image entropy (0.05 \u00b1 0.02), and relative percentage of LF energy (0.20 \u00b1 0.04) (P < .01).Among the five tested image features, variation in HF energy and visual complexity were the most promising in predicting the VLTs of body CT images for JPEG2000 compression.",
        "To analyze the dynamics of the shear modulus of the liver to assess the optimal driving frequency and to determine the diagnostic accuracy of generalized frequency-independent elasticity cutoff values for staging hepatic fibrosis.This institutional review board-approved prospective study included 16 healthy volunteers and 72 patients with biopsy-proved liver fibrosis. After obtaining written informed consent, imaging was performed at 1.5-T by using a motion-sensitized echo-planar imaging sequence. Wave excitation was performed by an actuator introducing a superposition of four frequencies (25.0, 37.5, 50.0, 62.5 Hz) of shear waves. The elasticity \u00b5 value and the structure geometry parameter \u03b1 were calculated by using the two-parameter springpot model. The performance of magnetic resonance (MR) elastography in staging liver fibrosis was assessed with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) analysis and Spearman correlation analysis.Elasticity increased with stage of fibrosis, with mean values as follows: for volunteers, 2.25 kPa \u00b1 0.43 (standard deviation); stage F1, 2.61 kPa \u00b1 0.43; stage F2, 3.00 kPa \u00b1 0.63; stage F3, 3.86 kPa \u00b1 0.61; and stage F4, 5.86 kPa \u00b1 1.22. Frequency-independent cutoff values derived for fibrosis and AUROC values, respectively, were as follows: stage F1 or higher, 2.84 kPa and 0.9128; stage F2 or higher, 3.18 kPa and 0.9244; stage F3 or higher, 3.32 kPa and 0.9744; and equivalent to stage F4, 4.21 kPa and 0.9931. The geometry of the tissue (\u03b1 value) did not correlate with fibrosis. Frequencies of 50.0 Hz and 62.5 Hz displayed the highest diagnostic accuracy.The diagnostic performance of multifrequency MR elastography in determining the degree of hepatic fibrosis increases with stage of fibrosis. Metrics obtained at the higher frequencies provide better diagnostic performance compared with the lower frequencies. Results of the AUROC analysis demonstrate the high accuracy of frequency-independent cutoff values for staging higher grades of hepatic fibrosis.",
        "Purpose To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance (MR) elastography as a method to help diagnose clinically substantial fibrosis in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and, by using MR elastography as a reference standard, to compare various laboratory marker panels in the identification of patients with NAFLD and advanced fibrosis. Materials and Methods This retrospective study was institutional review board approved and HIPAA complaint. Informed consent was waived. This study was conducted in patients with NAFLD, who were identified by imaging characteristics consistent with steatosis in a prospective database that tracks all MR elastographic examinations. Six laboratory-based models of fibrosis were compared with MR elastographic results as well as fibrosis stage from liver biopsy results. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of each data set were compared. Results Among 325 patients with NAFLD with MR elastographic data, there were 142 patients who underwent liver biopsy within 1 year of MR elastography. When comparing MR elastography results with liver biopsy results, the best cutoff for advanced fibrosis (stage F3\u2013F4, 46 [32.4%] of 142) was 4.15 kPa (AUROC = 0.954, sensitivity = 0.85, specificity = 0.929). This cutoff value identified 104 patients with advanced fibrosis (32.0% of 325 patients). The FIB-4 score (AUROC = 0.827) and NAFLD fibrosis score (AUROC = 0.821) had the best diagnostic accuracy for advanced fibrosis, with high negative predictive values (NAFLD fibrosis score = 0.90 and FIB-4 score = 0.899). Conclusion MR elastography is a useful diagnostic tool for detecting advanced fibrosis in NAFLD. Of the laboratory-based methods, the NAFLD fibrosis and FIB-4 scores can most reliably detect advanced fibrosis. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.13121193/-/DC1",
        "To compare image quality and lesion conspicuity on abdominal computed tomographic (CT) images acquired with different x-ray tube current-time products (50-200 mAs) and reconstructed with adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) and filtered back projection (FBP) techniques.Twenty-two patients (mean age, 60.1 years \u00b1 7.3 [standard deviation]; age range, 52.8-67.4 years; mean weight, 78.9 kg \u00b1 18.3; 12 men, 10 women) gave informed consent for this prospective institutional review board-approved and HIPAA-compliant study, which involved the acquisition of four additional image series at multidetector CT. Images were acquired at different tube current-time products (200, 150, 100, and 50 mAs) and encompassed an abdominal lesion over a 10-cm scan length. Images were reconstructed separately with FBP and with three levels of ASIR-FBP blending. Two radiologists reviewed FBP and ASIR images for image quality in a blinded and randomized manner. Volume CT dose index (CTDI(vol)), dose-length product, patient weight, objective noise, and CT numbers were recorded. Data were analyzed by using analysis of variance and the Wilcoxon signed rank test.CTDI(vol) values were 16.8, 12.6, 8.4, and 4.2 mGy for 200, 150, 100, and 50 mAs, respectively (P < .001). Subjective noise was graded as below average at 150 mAs and average at 100 and 50 mAs for ASIR images, as compared with FBP images, on which noise was graded as average at 150 mAs, above average at 100 mAs, and unacceptable at 50 mAs. A substantial blotchy image appearance was noted in four of 22 image series acquired at 4.2 mGy with 70% ASIR. Lesion conspicuity was significantly better at 4.2 mGy on ASIR than on FBP images (observed P < .044), and overall diagnostic confidence changed from unacceptable on FBP to acceptable on ASIR images.ASIR lowers noise and improves diagnostic confidence in and conspicuity of subtle abdominal lesions at 8.4 mGy when images are reconstructed with 30% ASIR blending and at 4.2 mGy in patients weighing 90 kg or less when images are reconstructed with 50% or 70% ASIR blending.",
        "To validate an on-site algorithm for computation of fractional flow reserve (FFR) from coronary computed tomographic (CT) angiography data against invasively measured FFR and to test its diagnostic performance as compared with that of coronary CT angiography.The institutional review board provided a waiver for this retrospective study. From coronary CT angiography data in 106 patients, FFR was computed at a local workstation by using a computational fluid dynamics algorithm. Invasive FFR measurement was performed in 189 vessels (80 of which had an FFR \u2264 0.80); these measurements were regarded as the reference standard. The diagnostic characteristics of coronary CT angiography-derived computational FFR, coronary CT angiography, and quantitative coronary angiography were evaluated against those of invasively measured FFR by using C statistics. Sensitivity and specificity were compared by using a two-sided McNemar test.For computational FFR, sensitivity was 87.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 78.2%, 93.8%), specificity was 65.1% (95% CI: 55.4%, 74.0%), and accuracy was 74.6% (95% CI: 68.4%, 80.8%), as compared with the finding of lumen stenosis of 50% or greater at coronary CT angiography, for which sensitivity was 81.3% (95% CI: 71.0%, 89.1%), specificity was 37.6% (95% CI: 28.5%, 47.4%), and accuracy was 56.1% (95% CI: 49.0%, 63.2%). C statistics revealed a larger area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for computational FFR (AUC, 0.83) than for coronary CT angiography (AUC, 0.64). For vessels with intermediate (25%-69%) stenosis, the sensitivity of computational FFR was 87.3% (95% CI: 76.5%, 94.3%) and the specificity was 59.3% (95% CI: 47.8%, 70.1%).With use of a reduced-order algorithm, computation of the FFR from coronary CT angiography data can be performed locally, at a regular workstation. The diagnostic accuracy of coronary CT angiography-derived computational FFR for the detection of functionally important coronary artery disease (CAD) was good and was incremental to that of coronary CT angiography within a population with a high prevalence of CAD.",
        "To evaluate the integrity of brain cholinergic pathways in vivo in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) by measuring the vesicular acetylcholine transporter expression at single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with [123I]-iodobenzovesamicol.All participants provided informed written consent according to institutional human ethics committee guidelines. Ten patients with PSP and 12 healthy volunteers underwent dynamic [123I]-iodobenzovesamicol SPECT and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. CT and MR images were used to register the dynamic SPECT image to the Montreal Neurologic Institute brain template, which includes the regions of interest of the striatum and the septo-hippocampal, innominato-cortical, and ponto-thalamic cholinergic pathways. For each region of interest, pharmacokinetic modeling of regional time activity curves was used to calculate [123I]-iodobenzovesamicol to vesicular acetylcholine transporter binding potential value, proportional to vesicular acetylcholine transporter expression.When compared with control participants, patients with PSP had binding potential values that were unchanged in the striatum and septohippocampal pathway, significantly lower in the anterior cingulate cortex (P=.017) in the innominatocortical pathway, and significantly decreased in the thalamus (P=.014) in the pontothalamic cholinergic pathway. In addition, binding potential values in the thalamus were positively correlated with those in the pedunculopontine nucleus (\u03c1=0.81, P<.004) and binding potential values in both the thalamus (\u03c1=-0.88, P<.001) and pedunculopontine nucleus (\u03c1=-0.80, P<.010) were inversely correlated with disease duration.Cholinergic pathways were differentially affected in the PSP group, with a significant alteration of pontothalamic pathways that increased with disease progression at both cell body and terminal levels, while the innominatocortical pathway was only mildly affected, and the septohippocampal pathway and the striatum were both preserved.",
        "To determine conversion factors for the new International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) publication 103 recommendations for adult and pediatric patients and to compare the effective doses derived from Monte Carlo calculations with those derived from dose-length product (DLP) for different body regions and computed tomographic (CT) scanning protocols.Effective dose values for the Oak Ridge National Laboratory phantom series, including phantoms for newborns; 1-, 5-, and 10-year-old children; and adults were determined by using Monte Carlo methods for a 64-section multidetector CT scanner. For each phantom, five anatomic regions (head, neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis) were considered. Monte Carlo simulations were performed for spiral scanning protocols with different voltages. Effective dose was computed by using ICRP publication 60 and publication 103 recommendations. The calculated effective doses were compared with those derived from the DLP by using previously published conversion factors.In general, conversion factors determined on the basis of Monte Carlo calculations led to lower values for adults with both ICRP publications. Values up to 33% and 32% lower than previously published data were found for ICRP publication 60 and ICRP publication 103, respectively. For pediatric individuals, effective doses based on the Monte Carlo calculations were higher than those obtained from DLP and previously published conversion factors (eg, for chest CT scanning in 5-year-old children, an increase of about 76% would be expected). For children, a variation in conversion factors of up to 15% was observed when the tube voltage was varied. For adult individuals, no dependence on voltage was observed.Conversion factors from DLP to effective dose should be specified separately for both sexes and should reflect the new ICRP recommendations. For pediatric patients, new conversion factors specific for the spectrum used should be established.",
        "To determine whether liver function correlating with indocyanine green (ICG) clearance could be estimated quantitatively from gadoxetate disodium-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) images.This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and the requirement for informed consent was waived. Twenty-three consecutive patients who underwent an ICG clearance test and gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MR imaging with the same parameters as were used for a preoperative examination were chosen. The hepatocellular uptake index (HUI) from liver volume (V(L))and mean signal intensity of the liver on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images with fat suppression (L(20)) and mean signal intensity of the spleen on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images with fat suppression (S(20)) on 3D gradient-echo T1-weighted images with fat suppression obtained at 20 minutes after gadoxetate disodium (0.025 mmol per kilogram of body weight) administration was determined with the following equation: V(L)[(L(20)/S(20)) - 1]. The correlation of the plasma disappearance rate of ICG (ICG-PDR) and various factors derived from MR imaging, including HUI, iron and fat deposition in the liver and spleen, and spleen volume (V(S)), were evaluated with stepwise multiple regression analysis. The difference between the ratio of the remnant HUI to the HUI of the total liver (rHUI/HUI) and ratio of the liver remnant V(L) to the total V(L) (rV(L)/V(L)) was evaluated in four patients who had segmental heterogeneity of liver function.HUI and V(S) were the factors significantly correlated with ICG-PDR (R = 0.87). The mean value and its 95% confidence interval were 0.18 and 0.01 to 0.34, respectively, for the following calculation: (rHUI/HUI) - (rV(L)/V(L)).The liver function correlating with ICG-PDR can be estimated quantitatively from the signal intensities and the volumes of the liver and spleen on gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MR images, which may improve the estimation of segmental liver function.",
        "Purpose To determine the degree of preoperative fatty degeneration within muscles, postoperative longitudinal changes in fatty degeneration, and differences in fatty degeneration between patients with full-thickness supraspinatus tears who do and those who do not experience a retear after surgery. Materials and Methods This prospective study had institutional review board approval and was conducted in accordance with the Committee for Human Research. Informed consent was obtained. Fifty patients with full-thickness supraspinatus tears (18 men, 32 women; mean age, 67.0 years \u00b1 8.0; age range, 41\u201391 years) were recruited. The degrees of preoperative and postoperative fatty degeneration were quantified by using a two-point Dixon magnetic resonance (MR) imaging sequence; two radiologists measured the mean signal intensity on in-phase [S(In)] and fat [S(Fat)] images. Estimates of fatty degeneration were calculated with \"fat fraction\" values by using the formula S(Fat)/S(In) within the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and subscapularis muscles at baseline preoperative and at postoperative 1-year follow-up MR imaging. Preoperative fat fractions in the failed-repair group and the intact-repair group were compared by using the Mann-Whitney U test. Results The preoperative fat fractions in the supraspinatus muscle were significantly higher in the failed-repair group than in the intact-repair group (37.0% vs 19.5%, P < .001). Fatty degeneration of the supraspinatus muscle tended to progress at 1 year postoperatively in only the failed-repair group. Conclusion MR imaging quantification of preoperative fat fractions by using a two-point Dixon sequence within the rotator cuff muscles may be a viable method for predicting postoperative retear. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016",
        "To compare the sensitivity and specificity of diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for identifying liver metastases from neuroendocrine tumor (NET) to those of T2-weighted fast spin-echo (FSE) and three-dimensional dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging, with surgical and histopathologic findings as the reference standard.This retrospective study was approved by institutional review board, and informed consent was waived. Fifty-nine patients with NETs (41 patients with 162 liver metastases, and 18 control subjects with no liver metastases) underwent MR imaging that included DW, T2-weighted FSE, and dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MR sequences. Images were retrospectively reviewed by two abdominal radiologists, independently, for the detection and characterization of liver metastases. MR findings were compared with histopathologic and intraoperative ultrasonography findings for metastasis on a lesion-by-lesion basis to determine the sensitivity of each MR sequence alone and combined. Specificity was calculated by using the control population. Interreader agreement for each MR sequence and McNemar test were also calculated.There was excellent agreement between observers 1 and 2 for characterizing liver metastases at per-lesion analysis (\u03ba coefficient: 0.86-1.00). DW MR was more sensitive (observer 1: sensitivity, 71.6% [116 of 162], 95% confidence interval [CI]: 64.2%, 78.0%; observer 2: sensitivity, 71.0% [115 of 162], 95% CI: 63.6%, 77.4%) than T2-weighted FSE (observer 1: sensitivity, 55.6% [90 of 162], 95% CI: 47.9%, 63.0%; observer 2: sensitivity, 55.6% [90 of 162], 95% CI: 47.9%, 63.0%) and dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MR (observer 1: sensitivity, 47.5% [77 of 162], 95% CI: 34.0%, 55.2%; observer 2: sensitivity, 48.1% [78 of 162], 95% CI: 40.6%, 55.8%) (P < .001 for both, McNemar test). The specificity of these sequences ranged from 88.9% to 100% (DW MR vs T2-weighted FSE MR: P > .99, DW MR vs dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MR: P = .61, and T2-weighted FSE MR vs dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MR: P = .61, McNemar test).DW MR imaging was more sensitive for the detection and characterization of liver metastases from NETs than T2-weighted FSE and dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging and should be systematically performed.",
        "To evaluate ultrasonographic (US) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings, histopathologic etiologies, and outcomes for developing asymmetry at mammography.In this institutional review board-approved, informed consent-waived, HIPAA-compliant, retrospective review of a mammography database for records from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2012, 2354 consecutive diagnostic mammograms classified as showing focal asymmetry were identified. After patients with benign results, those considered stable, and those without prior mammograms were excluded, images from 521 studies were reviewed and 202 developing lesions were identified in 201 women. Patient demographics, US and MR imaging findings, and clinical and histopathologic outcomes were obtained from the electronic medical records. Equivocal US correlates of findings with developing asymmetry detected at mammography were excluded from statistical analysis. The Fisher exact test and Student t test analysis were performed and relative risk and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined.Biopsy was performed in 73 (36%) of 201 patients with developing asymmetries, with 42 (58%) benign and 31 (42%) malignant results. Of 128 patients with nonbiopsied lesions, 110 (86%) were stable at 24 months (considered benign), 12 (9.4%) were stable at less than 24 months, and six (4.7%) were lost to follow-up. Diagnostic US was performed in 186 (93%) of 201 patients, 74 (40%) with correlates. US was performed in 30 (97%) of 31 patients with malignant developing asymmetries, 17 (57%) with correlates, and in 140 (92%) of 152 patients with benign lesions, 51 (36%) with correlates (risk ratio, 1.92; 95% CI: 1.001, 3.695; two-tailed P = .064, one-tailed P = .038). MR imaging was performed in 66 (33%) of 201 patients, 26 (39%) with correlates. MR imaging was performed in 10 (32%) of 31 patients with malignant developing asymmetries, all with correlates, and 53 (35%) of 152 patients with benign lesions, 15 (28%) with correlates (P < .0001).Developing asymmetries were malignant in 15% (95% CI: 11%, 21.1%) of patients. Presence of a US or MR imaging correlate was predictive of malignancy.",
        "To quantify the effect sizes of regional metabolic and morphometric measures in patients with preclinical and mild Alzheimer disease (AD) to aid in the identification of noninvasive biomarkers for the early detection of AD.The study was conducted with institutional review board approval and in compliance with HIPAA regulations. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant or participant's legal guardian. Fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging data were analyzed from 80 healthy control (HC) subjects, 68 individuals with AD, and 156 with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 69 of whom had single-domain amnestic MCI. Regions of interest (ROIs) were derived after coregistering FDG PET and MR images by using high-throughput, subject-specific procedures. The Cohen d effect sizes were calculated for 42 predefined ROIs across the brain. Statistical comparison of the largest overall effect sizes for MR imaging and PET was performed. Metabolic effect sizes were determined with and without accounting for regional atrophy. Discriminative accuracy of ROIs showing the largest effect sizes were compared by calculating receiver operating characteristic curves.For all disease groups, the hippocampus showed the largest morphometric effect size and the entorhinal cortex showed the largest metabolic effect size. In mild AD, the Cohen d effect size for hippocampal volume (1.92) was significantly larger (P < .05) than that for entorhinal metabolism (1.43). Regression of regional atrophy substantially reduced most metabolic effects. For all group comparisons, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were significantly larger for hippocampal volume than for entorhinal metabolism.The current results show no evidence that FDG PET is more sensitive than MR imaging to the degeneration occurring in preclinical and mild AD, suggesting that an MR imaging finding may be a more practical clinical biomarker for early detection of AD.",
        "To compare neoplastic and nonneoplastic disease in the anterior extradural space (AES) with regard to the contour of the disease and the tethering of the central septum, as seen on axial magnetic resonance (MR) images.In this institutional review board-approved HIPAA-compliant study, the data of patients who had AES disease determined at MR imaging and underwent diagnostic biopsy were studied. Two blinded observers reviewed the MR images and assigned the patients to one of two groups on the basis of the contour of AES disease: those with a centrally convex disease contour posteriorly and those whose disease contour was tethered in the midline to the posterior aspect of the vertebral body. Biopsy results served as the standard of reference. The two-tailed Fisher exact test, the Breslow-Day test, and \u03ba statistics were used to compare groups. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the midline tethered contour of AES disease for the detection of neoplasm were calculated.The data of 32 patients (16 men, 16 women; mean age, 68 years) were studied. Seventeen patients had malignant epidural disease. Fifteen patients had nonneoplastic epidural disease: Six patients had hematomas, and nine had abscesses. A greater proportion of AES neoplasms (13 [76%] and 14 [82%] of 17 lesions for observers 1 and 2, respectively) than nonneoplastic AES lesions (four [27%] and three [20%] of 15 lesions for observers 1 and 2, respectively) demonstrated midline tethering of the central septum. For observers 1 and 2, a unilobed or bilobed appearance of AES disease had sensitivities of 76% (13 of 17 lesions) and 82% (14 of 17 lesions), respectively; specificities of 73% (11 of 15 lesions) and 80% (12 of 15 lesions), respectively; and accuracies of 75% (24 of 32 lesions) and 81% (26 of 32 lesions), respectively, for the detection of neoplasm. The mean \u03ba value for interobserver variability was 0.62 (95% confidence interval: 0.35, 0.90).AES disease preserving the midline tethering of the central septum is more common with neoplastic disease than with infections or hematomas.",
        "To determine if repeated intravenous exposures to gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are associated with neuronal tissue deposition.In this institutional review board-approved single-center study, signal intensities from T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images and postmortem neuronal tissue samples from 13 patients who underwent at least four GBCA-enhanced brain MR examinations between 2000 and 2014 (contrast group) were compared with those from 10 patients who did not receive GBCA (control group). Antemortem consent was obtained from all study participants. Neuronal tissues from the dentate nuclei, pons, globus pallidus, and thalamus of these 23 deceased patients were harvested and analyzed with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), transmission electron microscopy, and light microscopy to quantify, localize, and assess the effects of gadolinium deposition. Associations between cumulative gadolinium dose, changes in T1-weighted MR signal intensity, and ICP-MS-derived tissue gadolinium concentrations were examined by using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient (\u03c1).Compared with neuronal tissues of control patients, all of which demonstrated undetectable levels of gadolinium, neuronal tissues of patients from the contrast group contained 0.1-58.8 \u03bcg gadolinium per gram of tissue, in a significant dose-dependent relationship that correlated with signal intensity changes on precontrast T1-weighted MR images (\u03c1 = 0.49-0.93). All patients in the contrast group had relatively normal renal function at the time of MR examination. Gadolinium deposition in the capillary endothelium and neural interstitium was observed only in the contrast group.Intravenous GBCA exposure is associated with neuronal tissue deposition in the setting of relatively normal renal function. Additional studies are needed to investigate the clinical significance of these findings and the generalizability to other GBCAs. Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To evaluate coronary arterial lesions and to assess their correlation with clinical findings in patients with Takayasu arteritis (TA) by using coronary computed tomographic (CT) angiography. Materials and Methods This retrospective study was approved by the hospital internal review board, and informed consent was waived. A total of 111 consecutive patients with TA (97 female, 14 male; mean age, 44 years \u00b1 13.8 [standard deviation]; age range, 14\u201374 years) underwent CT angiography of the coronary arteries and aorta with 128-section dual-source CT. CT angiographic, clinical, and laboratory findings of each patient were retrospectively reviewed. Statistical differences between coronary CT angiographic findings and clinical parameters were examined with univariate analysis. Results Of 111 patients, 32 (28.8%) had cardiac symptoms and the remaining 79 (71.2%) had no cardiac symptoms. Fifty-nine patients (53.2%) had coronary arterial lesions at coronary CT angiography. Three main radiologic features were detected: coronary ostial stenosis (n = 31, 28.0%), nonostial coronary arterial stenosis (n = 41, 36.9%), and coronary aneurysm (n = 9, 8.1%). Coronary artery ostial or luminal stenosis of 50% or more or coronary aneurysms were observed in 26 (23.4%) patients with TA. Patients with coronary arterial abnormalities at coronary CT angiography had higher incidences of hypertension (P = .02), were older at the time of CT (P = .01), and had longer duration of TA (P = .02) than those without coronary artery abnormalities. The presence of cardiac symptoms, disease activity, and other comorbidities was not associated with differences in coronary artery involvement. Conclusion In patients with TA, there is a high prevalence of coronary arterial abnormalities at coronary CT angiography, regardless of disease activity or symptoms. Thus, coronary CT angiography may add information on coronary artery lesions in patients with TA. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "To compare imaging findings between laproscopic and open partial nephrectomy at 6 months after surgery and to follow the evolution of the findings over time.This HIPAA-compliant retrospective study had institutional review board approval and consent was waived. A surgical database was cross-referenced with an imaging database to identify patients who underwent partial nephrectomy and computed tomographic and/or magnetic resonance imaging within 6 months of surgery. Fifty-eight patients (mean age, 61 years; range, 34-78 years; 21 women, 37 men) underwent 62 partial nephrectomies (laparoscopic, 31; open, 31) to remove 68 masses. Two radiologists in consensus reviewed images obtained between 10 days and 72 months (mean, 28 months) after surgery. Preoperative mass size and location and postoperative kidney orientation, fat stranding, parenchymal defect, collection (including size, location, and appearance), and other complications were recorded. Relative incidence of postoperative imaging findings, demographics, and initial imaging findings of both groups were statistically assessed by using Student t and chi(2) tests corrected for multiple comparisons.Common imaging findings following surgery included kidney displacement (48% [30 of 62]), perinephric fat stranding (93% [63 of 68]), parenchymal defect (74% [50 of 68]), and a non-fat-containing postoperative collection 75%, with significantly more posterior renal displacement (P < .01) and a trend toward more persistent fat stranding in the open surgery group. Fifty-one collections were identified in 74% (43 of 58) of patients, with significantly more collections in the laparoscopic (90% [27 of 30] vs 55% [16 of 29]; P < .05). The proportion of resolved collections increased over time, with significantly more resolving in the open group within 24 months of surgery (P < .05). Development or resolution of a collection was not dependent on age, sex, preoperative lesion size, or location (P > .05).Prevalence of findings 2-3 years after partial nephrectomy depends on the surgical approach. After laparoscopic partial nephrectomy, collections are more frequently detected on images and may take longer to resolve than following an open approach.",
        "To assess the morphologic changes of osteoid osteomas on computed tomographic (CT) scans in association with pain duration.Institutional review board approval was obtained. Informed consent was waived. From January 2008 to December 2012, 235 patients were treated with interstitial laser ablation at the H\u00f4pital Lariboisi\u00e8re. Ninety-six patients with histopathologically proven osteoid osteomas, complete clinical files, and CT data were studied retrospectively. The following variables were assessed: age, sex, bone location, bone segment, location of the osteoid osteoma in relation to the native cortex, nidus area, nidus calcification area and attenuation at CT, and nidus mineralization ratio (percentage of the calcification area over the total nidus area). Analysis of variance, Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox multivariate regression model were used for statistical analyses.The study sample consisted of 96 patients, 68 of whom were male (71%) and 28 of whom were female (29%) (ratio of male to female patients, 2.4:1). Mean age \u00b1 standard deviation was 22.2 years \u00b1 10.4 (range, 4-54 years; median, 18.5 years). The patients' age and nidus mineralization ratio increased significantly with pain duration (hazard ratio, 0.975 [P = .031] and 0.193 [P = .007], respectively). No significant association was found between pain duration and other variables, including the nidus area. In long bones, diaphyseal osteoid osteomas were significantly less mineralized than those in other locations (P = .009).The nidus mineralization ratio of osteoid osteomas increases significantly with pain duration and may be a marker of tumor age. Diaphyseal osteoid osteomas demonstrate a lower ratio of nidus mineralization. At the onset of symptoms, older patients experience pain for a longer period before treatment.",
        "Purpose To compare effectiveness of transarterial ethanol ablation (TEA) and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and determine whether TEA leads to better overall survival and tumor response than TACE. Materials and Methods In this institutional review board\u2013approved preregistered randomized controlled trial (n = 200), informed consent was obtained. Primary outcome was overall survival; secondary outcomes were time to progression (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS), tumor response at computed tomography, and treatment-related toxicity. Eligible patients were randomized at a 1:1 ratio. Treatment included transcatheter delivery of ethiodized oil\u2013ethanol mixture (2:1 ratio by volume up to 60 mL) for TEA and cisplatin\u2013ethiodized oil emulsion (0.5 mg cisplatin per milliliter up to 30 mg), followed by 1-mm gelatin-sponge pellets, for TACE. Study was terminated after interim analysis (n = 98); 90 patients were available for analysis. Overall survival, TTP, and PFS were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier method; differences were compared with log-rank test. Results Study was terminated prematurely after interim analysis, which showed no difference in overall survival; this was unlikely to change with further patient accrual. Median overall survival in TEA and TACE was 24.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 12.8, 32.7) and 20.1 months (95% CI: 9.3, 31.2), respectively (P = .358). Median TTP and PFS for intralesional progression were longer with TEA than TACE (TTP, 34.6 months [95% CI: 28.2, 41] vs 26.05 months [95% CI: 18.7, 33.3]; PFS, 14.8 months [95% CI: 10.2, 19.5] vs 9.3 months [95% CI: 7.1, 11.5]) (P = .028 and 0.029, respectively). Complete response rate on a tumor basis was persistently and significantly higher with TEA at 3 months (62 of 88 [70%] vs 39 of 76 [51%], P = .012), 6 months (64 of 88 [73%] vs 41 of 76 [54%], P = .012), and 12 months (66 of 88 [75%] vs 45 of 76 [59%], P = .031). Conclusion Although there was no significant difference in overall survival, TEA demonstrated better complete tumor response, longer time to intralesional progression, and longer PFS. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Clinical trial registration no.

        "Purpose To evaluate the feasibility of using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) to visualize the in vivo recruitment of iron oxide\u2013labeled macrophages and indium 111 (111In)-labeled macrophages in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and to monitor disease activity. Materials and Methods This study had institutional animal care and use committee approval. Twenty-seven C57/B6 mice with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced IBD and control mice were included. Peritoneal macrophages were harvested from seven thioglycollate-treated mice and were labeled with superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles. Macrophage iron content was determined by using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. SPIO nanoparticle\u2013labeled macrophages (5 \u00d7 106) were intravenously administered. Mice with DSS-induced IBD (n = 8) and control mice (n = 6) were imaged with a 9.4-T MR imaging unit at 0, 5, and 24 hours after macrophage administration. Percentage normalized enhancement (NE) was calculated for the intestinal wall and liver 24 hours after injection. Six mice with IBD coinjected with SPIO nanoparticles and 111In oxine\u2013labeled macrophages were imaged with MR imaging and SPECT/CT after 24 hours. The pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of the implanted macrophages were determined. Correlation between percentage NE and IBD scores was calculated. Results Ex vivo mass spectrometry revealed strong SPIO nanoparticle uptake (7.4 pg iron per cell). R2* correlated with cell number (r = 0.9813, P < .05). Percentage NE correlated with both clinical (r = 0.924) and pathologic (r = 0.795) IBD score. Cell circulation half-life in the first and second phases was 0.32 hour and 10.2 hours, respectively. SPECT/CT showed that approximately 3% of the injected dose was present in the intestines 24 hours after injection; this was confirmed at MR imaging and histologic examination. Indium 111\u2013labeled cells were present in all tissue associated with the reticuloendothelial system or mononuclear phagocyte system at 24 hours. Conclusion SPIO nanoparticles and 111In-labeled macrophages could be observed in vivo at MR imaging and SPECT/CT in mice with IBD. Percentage NE at MR imaging correlates with disease activity. \u00a9 RSNA, 2014 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To evaluate the performance of a prototype photon-counting detector (PCD) computed tomography (CT) system for abdominal CT in humans and to compare the results with a conventional energy-integrating detector (EID). Materials and Methods The study was HIPAA-compliant and institutional review board\u2013approved with informed consent. Fifteen asymptomatic volunteers (seven men; mean age, 58.2 years \u00b1 9.8 [standard deviation]) were prospectively enrolled between September 2 and November 13, 2015. Radiation dose\u2013matched delayed contrast agent\u2013enhanced spiral and axial abdominal EID and PCD scans were acquired. Spiral images were scored for image quality (Wilcoxon signed-rank test) in five regions of interest by three radiologists blinded to the detector system, and the axial scans were used to assess Hounsfield unit accuracy in seven regions of interest (paired t test). Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to assess reproducibility. PCD images were also used to calculate iodine concentration maps. Spatial resolution, noise-power spectrum, and Hounsfield unit accuracy of the systems were estimated by using a CT phantom. Results In both systems, scores were similar for image quality (median score, 4; P = .19), noise (median score, 3; P = .30), and artifact (median score, 1; P = .17), with good interrater agreement (image quality, noise, and artifact ICC: 0.84, 0.88, and 0.74, respectively). Hounsfield unit values, spatial resolution, and noise-power spectrum were also similar with the exception of mean Hounsfield unit value in the spinal canal, which was lower in the PCD than the EID images because of beam hardening (20 HU vs 36.5 HU; P < .001). Contrast-to-noise ratio of enhanced kidney tissue was improved with PCD iodine mapping compared with EID (5.2 \u00b1 1.3 vs 4.0 \u00b1 1.3; P < .001). Conclusion The performance of PCD showed no statistically significant difference compared with EID when the abdomen was evaluated in a conventional scan mode. PCD provides spectral information, which may be used for material decomposition. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016",
        "Purpose To assess the reproducibility of aortic volume estimates and to serially test their use in patients with Marfan syndrome. Materials and Methods The study was approved by the medical ethics committee and all subjects gave written informed consent. In 81 patients with Marfan syndrome and seven healthy control subjects, aortic volumes and diameters at baseline were estimated by means of contrast material\u2013enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. At 3 years of follow-up, aortic expansion rate were calculated in a subgroup of 22 patients with Marfan syndrome. Total aortic volume was defined as volume measurement from the level of the aortic annulus to the aortic bifurcation. Intra- and interobserver agreement of aortic volume were calculated by using the intraclass correlation coefficient. Differences in variables were analyzed with the Student t test and logistic regression. Effect size was calculated. Results Intra- and interobserver agreement of aortic volume calculation was 0.996 and 0.980, respectively. Mean aortic volume was significantly greater in patients with Marfan syndrome than in control subjects (104 mL/m2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 95, 114 mL/m2 vs 74 mL/m2; 95% CI: 62, 87 mL/m2; P < .001). In 22 patients with Marfan syndrome, mean aortic volume was increased at 3 years of follow-up (17 mL; 95% CI: 8, 26 mL; P = .001; effect size, 0.29), while mean aortic diameter did not increase significantly (0.4 mm; 95% CI: 0.0, 0.9 mm; P = .171; effect size, 0.13). Conclusion Assessment of aortic volume is highly reproducible and may be suited for use in the detection of aortic expansion in patients with Marfan syndrome. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Supplemental material: S1",
        "Purpose To investigate whether the blood-brain barrier (BBB) leaks blood-circulating substances in patients with early forms of Alzheimer disease (AD), and if so, to examine the extent and pattern of leakage. Materials and Methods This study was approved by the local medical ethical committees of the Maastricht University Medical Center and Leiden University Medical Center, and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. For this pilot study, 16 patients with early AD and 17 healthy age-matched control subjects underwent dynamic contrast material-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging sequence with dual time resolution for 25 minutes. The Patlak graphical approach was used to quantify the BBB leakage rate and local blood plasma volume. Subsequent histogram analysis was used to determine the volume fraction of the leaking brain tissue. Differences were assessed with linear regression analysis, adjusted for confounding variables. Results The BBB leakage rate was significantly higher in patients compared with that in control subjects in the total gray matter (P < .05) and cortex (P = .03). Patients had a significantly higher volume fraction of the leaking brain tissue in the gray matter (P = .004), normal-appearing white matter (P < .04), deep gray matter (P = .01), and cortex (P = .004). When all subjects were considered, scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination decreased significantly with increasing leakage in the deep gray matter (P = .007) and cortex (P < .05). Conclusion The results of this study showed global BBB leakage in patients with early AD that is associated with cognitive decline. A compromised BBB may be part of a cascade of pathologic events that eventually lead to cognitive decline and dementia. \u00a9RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To evaluate the presence of linear intrathrombus enhancement in coronary total occlusion (CTO) lesions observed at coronary computed tomographic (CT) angiography and its correlation with the outcome of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).All patients gave written informed consent, and the study protocol was approved by the hospital ethics committee. Consecutive patients with CTO confirmed at initial conventional coronary angiography were prospectively chosen to undergo a coronary CT angiography examination prior to their staged PCI. Linear intrathrombus enhancement was defined as a linear area of enhanced opacity traversing the nonopacified occluded segment with attenuation higher than 120 HU. Angiographic features, including lesion length, linear intrathrombus enhancement length, and calcification score, were measured at coronary CT angiography. Univariate and multivariate statistical tests were performed to identify variables associated with successful PCI.Eighty patients with 88 CTO lesions were included in this study. Fifty-one lesions were successfully recanalized at PCI. Lesion length was longer in the PCI failure group (P = .043). Linear intrathrombus enhancement was observed in 30 (59%) of the 51 lesions successfully treated with PCI. However, linear enhancement was found in seven (19%) of 37 patients with failed PCI (P < .001 as compared with patients with successful PCI). Tortuous course was revealed to be the only angiographic parameter associated with unfavorable PCI outcome (P = .008). The presence of linear intrathrombus enhancement proved at multivariate analysis to be the only independent predictor of PCI success (odds ratio: 4.926; 95% confidence interval: 1.646, 14.74; P = .004).The presence of coronary CT angiography-visible linear intrathrombus enhancement within the occluded segment predicts better outcome of PCI in CTOs.",
        "Purpose To characterize the incidence, location, grade, and patterns of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings in the tibia in asymptomatic recruits before and after 4-month basic training and to investigate whether MR imaging parameters correlated with pretraining activity levels or with future symptomatic injury. Materials and Methods This study was approved by three institutional review boards and was conducted in compliance with HIPAA requirements. Volunteers were included in the study after they signed informed consent forms. MR imaging of the tibia of 55 men entering the Israeli Special Forces was performed on recruitment day and after basic training. Ten recruits who did not perform vigorous self-training prior to and during service served as control subjects. MR imaging studies in all recruits were evaluated for presence, type, length, and location of bone stress changes in the tibia. Anthropometric measurements and activity history data were collected. Relationships between bone stress changes, physical activity, and clinical findings and between lesion size and progression were analyzed. Results Bone stress changes were seen in 35 of 55 recruits (in 26 recruits at time 0 and in nine recruits after basic training). Most bone stress changes consisted of endosteal marrow edema. Approximately 50% of bone stress changes occurred between the middle and distal thirds of the tibia. Lesion size at time 0 had significant correlation with progression. All endosteal findings smaller than 100 mm resolved or did not change, while most findings larger than 100 mm progressed. Of 10 control subjects, one had bone stress changes at time 0, and one had bone stress changes at 4 months. Conclusion Most tibial bone stress changes occurred before basic training, were usually endosteal, occurred between the middle and distal thirds of the tibia, were smaller than 100 mm, and did not progress. These findings are presumed to represent normal bone remodeling. \u00a9 RSNA, 2014",
        "Purpose To evaluate whether a dual-energy (DE) computed tomographic (CT) virtual noncalcium technique can improve the detection rate of acute thoracolumbar vertebral compression fractures in patients with osteoporosis compared with that at magnetic resonance (MR) imaging depending on the level of experience of the reading radiologist. Materials and Methods This retrospective study was approved by the institutional ethics committee. Informed consent was obtained from all patients. Forty-nine patients with osteoporosis who were suspected of having acute vertebral fracture underwent DE CT and MR imaging. Conventional linear-blended CT scans and corresponding virtual noncalcium reconstructions were obtained. Five radiologists with varying levels of experience evaluated gray-scale CT scans for the presence of fractures and their suspected age. Then, virtual noncalcium images were evaluated to detect bone marrow edema. Findings were compared with those from MR imaging (the standard of reference). Sensitivity and specificity analyses for diagnostic performance and matched pair analyses were performed on vertebral fracture and patient levels. Results Sixty-two fractures were classified as fresh and 52 as old at MR imaging. The diagnostic performance of all readers in the detection of fresh fractures improved with the addition of virtual noncalcium reconstructions compared with that with conventional CT alone. Although the diagnostic accuracy of the least experienced reader with virtual noncalcium CT (accuracy with CT alone, 61%; accuracy with virtual noncalcium technique, 83%) was within the range of that of the most experienced reader with CT alone, the latter improved his accuracy with the noncalcium technique (from 81% to 95%), coming close to that with MR imaging. The number of vertebrae rated as unclear decreased by 59%-90% or from 15-53 to 2-13 in absolute numbers across readers. The number of patients potentially referred to MR imaging decreased by 36%-87% (from 11-23 to 2-10 patients). Considering the gain in true decisions with the virtual noncalcium technique on a patient level, between 12 (most experienced reader) and 17 (least experienced reader) MR examinations could have been avoided. Conclusion The DE CT-based virtual noncalcium technique may enable depiction of bone marrow edema in thoracolumbar vertebral compression fractures in patients with osteoporosis, with good accordance with MR imaging when images are read by experienced radiologists. Although less experienced readers improved their diagnostic performance to some degree, the experienced reader's diagnostic performance approached that with MR imaging. (\u00a9) RSNA, 2016.",
        "To determine utility of proton density fat fraction (PDFF) measurements for quantifying the liver fat content in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and compare these results with liver biopsy findings.This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board with waivers of informed consent. Between June 2010 and April 2011, 86 patients received a diagnosis of NAFLD. Ten patients did not accept liver biopsy and six patients had contraindications for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Seventy patients were included in this study. Seventy patients with NAFLD (40 men, 30 women; mean age, 44.7 years; range, 16-69 years) underwent T1-independent volumetric multiecho gradient-echo imaging with T2* correction and spectral fat modeling. Median time interval between MR imaging and liver biopsy was 14.5 days (range, 0-259 days). MR examinations were performed with a 1.5-T MR imaging system. Complex-based PDFF measurements were performed by placing regions of interest in Couinaud system segments V-VI and all liver segments from I to VIII. All liver biopsy specimens were retrieved from archives and evaluated by one pathologist for hepatic steatosis according to criteria from a previous study. Pearson correlation coefficient, receiver operating characteristics, and linear regression analyses were used for statistical analyses.Mean PDFF calculated with MR imaging was 18.1% \u00b1 9.5 (standard deviation). Close correlation for quantification of hepatic steatosis was observed between PDFF and liver biopsy (r = 0.82). PDFF was effective in discriminating moderate or severe hepatic steatosis from mild or no hepatic steatosis, with area under the curve of 0.95. The correlation between biopsy and PDFF-determined steatosis was less pronounced when fibrosis was present (r = 0.60) than when fibrosis was absent (r = 0.86; P = .02).PDFF measurement by MR imaging provided a noninvasive, accurate estimation of the presence and grading of hepatic steatosis in patients with NAFLD. Hepatic fibrosis reduced the correlation between biopsy results and PDFF.",
        "To compare the diagnostic accuracy of two-dimensional (2D) full-field digital mammography with that of two-view (mediolateral and craniocaudal) and single-view (mediolateral oblique) tomosynthesis in an observer study involving two institutions.Ethical committee approval was obtained. All participating women gave informed consent. Two hundred twenty women (mean age, 56.3; range, 40-80 years) with breast density of 2-4 according to American College of Radiology criteria were recruited between November 2008 and September 2009 and underwent standard treatment plus tomosynthesis with a prototype photon-counting machine. After exclusion criteria were met, this resulted in a final test set of 130 women. Ten accredited readers classified the 130 cases (40 cancers, 24 benign lesions, and 66 normal images) using 2D mammography and two-view tomosynthesis. Another 10 readers reviewed the same cases using 2D mammography but single-view tomosynthesis. The multireader, multicase receiver operating characteristic (ROC) method was applied. The significance of the observed difference in accuracy between 2D mammography and tomosynthesis was calculated.For diagnostic accuracy, 2D mammography performed significantly worse than two-view tomosynthesis (average area under ROC curve [AUC] = 0.772 for 2D, AUC = 0.851 for tomosynthesis, P = .021). Significant differences were found for both masses and microcalcification (P = .037 and .049). The difference in AUC between the two modalities of -0.110 was significant (P = .03) only for the five readers with the least experience (<10 years of reading); with AUC of -0.047 for the five readers with 10 years or more experience (P = .25). No significant difference (P = .79) in reader performance was seen when 2D mammography (average AUC = 0.774) was compared with single-view tomosynthesis (average AUC = 0.775).Two-view tomosynthesis outperforms 2D mammography but only for readers with the least experience. The benefits were seen for both masses and microcalcification. No differences in classification accuracy was seen between and 2D mammography and single-view tomosynthesis.",
        "To investigate the mechanism of enhancement of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) on gadoxetic acid-enhanced hepatobiliary phase magnetic resonance (MR) images and to characterize HCC thus enhanced.This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and patient informed consent for research use of the resected specimen was obtained. MR images in 25 patients (20 men, five women; mean age, 68 years; range, 49-82 years) with 27 resected hypervascular HCCs (one well, 13 moderately, 13 poorly differentiated) that demonstrated hepatocyte-selective enhancement on gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR images, were quantitatively studied, and findings were correlated with results of immunohistochemical staining for a sinusoidal transporter, organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 (OATP1B1) and/or OATP1B3 (OATP1B1 and/or -1B3), and a canalicular transporter, multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2), and also with bile accumulation in tumors. Statistical analysis was performed with the Student t test and Scheff\u00e9 post hoc test.Combined with positive OATP1B1 and/or -1B3 expression (O+), two patterns of MRP2 expression contributed to high enhancement: decreased expression (M-, n = 3) and increased expression at the luminal membrane of pseudoglands (M+[P], n = 3). Nodules without OATP1B1 and/or -1B3 expression (O-, n = 13) and nodules with O+ associated with increased MRP2 expression only at the canaliculi (M+[C], n = 8) induced significantly lower enhancement than those with the two expression patterns described before (O+/M- group vs O- group, P = .002; O+/M- group vs O+/M+[C] group, P = .047; O+/M+[P] group vs O- group, P < .001; O+/M+[P] group vs O+/M+[C] group, P < .001). Nodules with bile pigment (n = 12) showed significantly higher enhancement (P = .004); all five nodules (one well differentiated HCC, four moderately differentiated HCCs), which were enhanced more than adjacent liver parenchyma, contained bile pigment.High hepatocyte-selective enhancement is induced by expression patterns of transporters, which may result in accumulation of gadoxetic acid in cytoplasm of tumor cells or in lumina of pseudoglands. An HCC with gadoxetic acid enhancement is characterized by bile accumulation in tumors.",
        "To estimate the performance of digital chest radiography for detection of lung cancer.The study had ethics committee approval, and a nested case-control design was used and included 55 patients with lung cancer detected at computed tomography (CT) and confirmed with histologic examination and a sample of 72 of 4873 control subjects without nodules at CT. All patients underwent direct-detector digital chest radiography in two projections within 2 months of the screening CT. Four radiologists with varying experience identified and localized potential cancers on chest radiographs by using a confidence scale of level 1 (no lesion) to 5 (definite lesion). Localization receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed. On the basis of the assumption that suspicious lesions seen at chest radiography would lead to further work-up with CT, the number of work-up CT examinations per detected cancer (CT examinations per cancer) was calculated at various confidence levels for the screening population (cancer rate in study population, 1.3%).Tumor size ranged from 6.8 to 50.7 mm (median, 11.8 mm). Areas under the localization ROC curve ranged from 0.52 to 0.69. Detection rates substantially varied with the observers' experience and confidence level: At a confidence level of 5, detection rates ranged from 18% at one CT examination per cancer to 53% at 13 CT examinations per cancer. At a confidence level of 2 or higher, detection rates ranged from 94% at 62 CT examinations per cancer to 78% at 44 CT examinations per cancer.A detection rate of 94% for lung tumors with a diameter of 6.8-50.7 mm found at CT screening was achievable with chest radiography only at the expense of a high false-positive rate and an excessive number of work-up CT examinations. Detection performance is strongly observer dependent.",
        "Purpose To compare the diagnostic performance of breast tomosynthesis versus supplemental mammography views in classification of masses, distortions, and asymmetries. Materials and Methods Eight radiologists who specialized in breast imaging retrospectively reviewed 217 consecutively accrued lesions by using protocols that were HIPAA compliant and institutional review board approved in 182 patients aged 31\u201360 years (mean, 50 years) who underwent diagnostic mammography and tomosynthesis. The lesions in the cohort included 33% (72 of 217) cancers and 67% (145 of 217) benign lesions. Eighty-four percent (182 of 217) of the lesions were masses, 11% (25 of 217) were asymmetries, and 5% (10 of 217) were distortions that were initially detected at clinical examination in 8% (17 of 217), at mammography in 80% (173 of 217), at ultrasonography (US) in 11% (25 of 217), or at magnetic resonance imaging in 1% (2 of 217). Histopathologic examination established truth in 191 lesions, US revealed a cyst in 12 lesions, and 14 lesions had a normal follow-up. Each lesion was interpreted once with tomosynthesis and once with supplemental mammographic views; both modes included the mediolateral oblique and craniocaudal views in a fully crossed and balanced design by using a five-category Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) assessment and a probability-of-malignancy score. Differences between modes were analyzed with a generalized linear mixed model for BI-RADS\u2013based sensitivity and specificity and with modified Obuchowski-Rockette approach for probability-of-malignancy\u2013based area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results Average probability-of-malignancy\u2013based area under the ROC curve was 0.87 for tomosynthesis versus 0.83 for supplemental views (P < .001). With tomosynthesis, the false-positive rate decreased from 85% (989 of 1160) to 74% (864 of 1160) (P < .01) for cases that were rated BI-RADS category 3 or higher and from 57% (663 of 1160) to 48% (559 of 1160) for cases rated BI-RADS category 4 or 5 (P < .01), without a meaningful change in sensitivity. With tomosynthesis, more cancers were classified as BI-RADS category 5 (39% [226 of 576] vs 33% [188 of 576]; P = .017) without a decrease in specificity. Conclusion Tomosynthesis significantly improved diagnostic accuracy for noncalcified lesions compared with supplemental mammographic views. \u00a9 RSNA, 2012",
        "Purpose To conduct a comprehensive analysis of radiologist-made assessments of glioblastoma (GBM) tumor size and composition by using a community-developed controlled terminology of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging visual features as they relate to genetic alterations, gene expression class, and patient survival. Materials and Methods Because all study patients had been previously deidentified by the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), a publicly available data set that contains no linkage to patient identifiers and that is HIPAA compliant, no institutional review board approval was required. Presurgical MR images of 75 patients with GBM with genetic data in the TCGA portal were rated by three neuroradiologists for size, location, and tumor morphology by using a standardized feature set. Interrater agreements were analyzed by using the Krippendorff \u03b1 statistic and intraclass correlation coefficient. Associations between survival, tumor size, and morphology were determined by using multivariate Cox regression models; associations between imaging features and genomics were studied by using the Fisher exact test. Results Interrater analysis showed significant agreement in terms of contrast material enhancement, nonenhancement, necrosis, edema, and size variables. Contrast-enhanced tumor volume and longest axis length of tumor were strongly associated with poor survival (respectively, hazard ratio: 8.84, P = .0253, and hazard ratio: 1.02, P = .00973), even after adjusting for Karnofsky performance score (P = .0208). Proneural class GBM had significantly lower levels of contrast enhancement (P = .02) than other subtypes, while mesenchymal GBM showed lower levels of nonenhanced tumor (P < .01). Conclusion This analysis demonstrates a method for consistent image feature annotation capable of reproducibly characterizing brain tumors; this study shows that radiologists' estimations of macroscopic imaging features can be combined with genetic alterations and gene expression subtypes to provide deeper insight to the underlying biologic properties of GBM subsets. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "Purpose To compare visualization of subtle normal and abnormal findings at computed tomography (CT) of the chest for diffuse lung disease with images reconstructed with filtered back projection and adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) techniques. Materials and Methods In this HIPAA-compliant, institutional review board\u2013approved study, 24 patients underwent 64-section multi\u2013detector row CT of the chest for evaluation of diffuse lung disease. Scanning parameters included a pitch of 0.984:1 and 120 kVp in thin-section mode, with 2496 views per rotation compared with 984 views acquired for normal mode. The 0.625-mm-thick images were reconstructed with filtered back projection, ASIR, and ASIR high-definition (ASIR-HD) kernels. Two thoracic radiologists independently assessed the filtered back projection, ASIR, and ASIR-HD images for small anatomic details (interlobular septa, centrilobular region, and small bronchi and bronchioles), abnormal findings (reticulation, tiny nodules, altered attenuation, bronchiectasis), image quality (graded by using a six-point scale, where 1 = excellent image quality, and 5 = interpretation impossible), image noise, and artifacts. Data were tabulated for statistical testing. Results For visualization of normal and pathologic structures, CT image series reconstructed with ASIR-HD were rated substantially better than those reconstructed with filtered back projection and ASIR (P < .001). ASIR-HD images were superior to filtered back projection images in 15 of 24 (62%) patients for visualization of normal structures and in 24 of 24 (100%) patients for pathologic findings. ASIR-HD was superior to ASIR in three of 24 (12%) images for normal anatomic findings and in seven of 24 (29%) images for pathologic evaluation. None of the images in the three groups were rated as unacceptable for noise (P < .001). Conclusion ASIR-HD reconstruction results in superior visualization of subtle and tiny anatomic structures and lesions in diffuse lung disease compared with ASIR and filtered back projection reconstructions. \u00a9 RSNA, 2010"
