I've been devastated.", "She talked sarcastically about how my life is \"obviously so horrible\" and I'd say \"yeah, mom, it is.\" She denied yelling at us all the time, and said that if I can say she yells all the time then she can say I yell all the time too (at my little siblings), which is just not true. I am nice to my siblings, excluding today where I was angry at everything. But I still didn't yell at them. She said that for months I've been terrorizing her about this \"yelling thing\" and how I think that one small mistake automatically means someone is a bad person.", "Hey all! I'm in San Diego CA and about 2 years ago I was diagnosed with lupus nephritis. I haven't had the most stable care and have had to move all over the country just to maintain safety. Most recently, my mother who I have a very rough (to say the least) relationship with said she would help take care of me financially as I cannot work right now. Well for some reason this last month my mom just stopped paying my rent which led to eviction.", "She then decided to go to a party without me and said \"I would cancel my plans to see you, but you won't do the same for me. All you do is push me away and act like a complete asshole.\" even though she was the one who left. I told her I didn't want to see her tonight after she tried to bait me into going over to her house. She was telling me I'm an asshole and the cause of all of her sadness, why would I want to go there?", "She has been cheated on after being married and while pregnant and about to have her baby. She has been gone through it and knows how it feels to be hurt and lied too and said she will never do it to anyone as she\u2019s been through it and is the type of person that wears her heart on her sleeve. I completely trust my husband but this is harder then I thought. Hard because I see her messaging him everyday day as soon as she wakes up and stays talking to him on the phone too. Hard because they still want to see each other.", "Okay so a bit of background, me and my girlfriend are in our second year of college (my subjects make a freshman though hehe) and have been together for 6 months. I want to be an ambassador and she wants to go into marketing. Every day we spend time together, there isn't a moment where the two of us don't end up talking about our future. To be more specific, we always end up talking extensively about marriage, what to name our daughter, how many golden retrievers to get and the like. Don't get me wrong, I love her to bits and I enjoy talking to her about these things, it's just that I'm slightly worried that maybe she is in love with the idea of me, and I with the idea of her.", "and then proceeded to show me the video of the \"dumb girlfriend\" struggling to answer the question. Needless to say, I was pissed. I said I couldn't believe he would think it was possible that I might be that stupid. He insisted that he only asked me as a joke, and then I got angrier because in what world is questioning my ability to handle basic logic funny? He continued to go on the offensive insisting that he had been kidding, that of course he doesn't think I'm stupid at all, and how could I even think he would think that?", "Normal start of our day. He asked \"was the card worth the wait?\" I answered \"Yes, I cried, at the park\" he jokingly said \"of course you did, tiny tears x\" and then he asked \"did you take photos of the chocolates?\" I said \"yes babe\" and sent him the photo - he was still online but the last 2 messages wasnt read. The next message i sent was all about my day - that wasnt sent anymore, he was offline... i thought he was getting ready for his work and his phone died or his network... after an hour, I got worried, so I sent messages on all social media that he has, which I know.", "It was no longer just about the life and love we were building together. It was no longer about us, it was about me and trying to fill this hole within myself. If she would just want me, make me feel wanted, I could baptize myself in it and finally let go of all this guilt and self-hatred. This male shame. It\u2019s complicated.", "It's been a while so I thought those feelings were long gone. At one point, I asked if Lily would come talk to me in my room, which she agreed to. In there, we made out. I don't remember a ton, but I do remember pulling away and immediately telling Lily \"oh my god, I can't believe I just did this.\" Like a drunk idiot, I called my boyfriend.", "She was already against smoking weed after college at first but now she seems to have moved to a stance where she's okay with me smoking weed as long as she's there when it happens, as in I could smoke with just her or when we're both hanging out with the same friends. I've tried asking her about it and genuinely understanding why she feels this way about it but she can't seem to describe it rationally, saying that it's a gut feeling that she gets that legitimately bothers her and gives her anxiety. She seemed very distressed talking about it and was almost at the poiint of tears saying that she wishes she knew why it bothers her so much but it does and she can't help it no matter how much she thinks about it or how much I try to explain it to her. I don't know how to explain this to her. I don't want to give up the option of smoking weed with friends but I don't want to break up with her over something like this because I love her.", "My girlfriend and I have been dating now for 3 months. We have a very happy relationship most of the time. I love her and she loves me and we spend almost all our time together. She can be insecure at times and has a couple mood swings where she can be very happy to very upset. I do my best to bring her out of those slumps and usually I do.", "But I'm literally afraid of him because I feel like every second he's gonna stand behind me again and grunt at me that he changed something or completely rewrite my code. Plus, I don't know if maybe he is talking badly about me as well when I'm not there (it seems likely). What can I do?   ---   **tl;dr**: Coworker who is supposed to show me the ropes is super grumpy and I find him intimidating, can I do anything about this?", "But upon second look, it can become apparent. It is hard to convey people's attitudes in a reddit post, but you can tell from people's vibes if they're being nice (and yes, that happened a lot) vs. if they have ulterior motives. So, maybe not the best reddit post, but don't think you can judge what happened based only on a cursory impression from the post. Besides the larger point is that the prejudice is rampant, whether or not you like my example. That's the larger point.", "I love her too, but I am super paranoid about the whole deal. Current situation: We both confessed that we love each other, but I won\u2019t be going back to my home country for another 6 months. Because of my past toxic relationship I fear things will change between us, we\u2019ll get into fights/have trust issues etc. Problem: Should I get into a LDR with her, or we should continue being best friends( which would be hard because she has already very clearly confessed she loves me) problems are: 1.", "I want to start off by saying I love my in laws. They do a LOT for us and we are incredibly grateful for them. My MIL has always been around to babysit when I\u2019ve needed to go to doctors appts, and seeing that she has MS (not severe), my SIL comes over to help play/do the lifting. My mil is capable of all of that, but she has a harder time. We have a history with my SIL.", "I\u2019m also quite intellectual, I can speak 2 languages other than my native language, English and Japanese. But I only want my boyfriend, he has a shy personality but he\u2019s very knowledgeable, he\u2019s like a walking Wikipedia and I love him so much. He makes me feel calm just laughing at our inside jokes, receiving a cute text from him, and ever since being in a relationship with him I\u2019ve grown to be happy with the smallest things in life. But he never seems to be able to move on from the event from his past, or he\u2018s just deeply affected by his depression and negative thoughts, also all the stress from his studying in university and family really is a big problem. All of this really took a toll of our relationship, to the point that we hardly called anymore or had any communication.", " We've known each other for 9 years, were FWB for about 3 years, then moved into the committed monogamous relationship we're in now, and have been in for 2 years. I've really enjoyed everything about our relationship, as she's taught me more than anyone ever has, and has been the best at putting up with any and all things that have come up. About halfway through the first year, she began asking if I'd ever be okay with her experimenting with a girl, or if I'd ever consider her having other sex friends. She doesn't want serious relationships with them, she only wants to bang. Having never been asked that in any of my previous relationships, I told her I wasn't sure and that were I ever 100% on board with that idea, I'd let her know.", "She Actually gave me 2 months to find a place to live before she was gonna kick me out but i couldn't find any and Friday is the last day of those 2 months. I don't have a car, or any friends that'll let me stay with them. In total , i have about 600 bucks . Maybe i could use that money to gtfo of Minnesota. Maybe i could buy a gun and shoot myself idk .", "It's also frustrating because I'm finally getting the kind of help I would expect from family and BEYOND from a woman I met while panhandling this summer. Thanks to a stranger: I've been able to finally get mental health assistance, I got my benefits fixed, I got a job, and I have a safe place to sleep out of the rain or snow. I have somewhere to leave my pack and bed roll rather than carry it around 24/7. I could probably ask to store that stuff, but it seems so asinine to ask more of this woman and especially so since it's just extra supplies for my dog I don't really need. I can't understand why even the bare minimum is too much to ask of the people who are supposed to care the most.", "Hi. So, my husband is emotionally and mentally abusive. I've tried to leave several times but he threatens to kill himself if I do, by crashing his car or running into traffic. However, I have nowhere to go even if I do. My family dosent want/can't afford to have me live with them again.", "I have tried to her encourage her as best as I can. The job she had was 10 hours per week, which I got for her to tutor a friend\u2019s 10yr old (who is a challenging child). She has an events business with her mother, which operates approximately once every six weeks to host mystery dinners, which is very popular, but does not make much funds. She spends a large amount of time on this and I get frustrated that some of that effort could be put into finding more stable work. She studies one unit a semester.", "I\u2019m just really scared about this entire situation and feel conflicted about what to do. This isn\u2019t the first time something like this has happened as my dad has previous jail records and he\u2019s threatened our family before and even hit us when we were smaller. I just feel really scared and really confused about everything and can\u2019t believe it\u2019s come to this. My mom doesn\u2019t want us to do anything because she lives in fear and is hoping to wait until I graduate (I\u2019m in 11th grade so we would have to wait a year and we really can\u2019t/shouldn\u2019t) so she can divorce him, she only wants to wait because she can\u2019t support us by herself.

I am confident that training would fix 70% of the issues that she has with my dog. Could there be something else deeply underlying that i am missing? To me a loving and healthy relationship is one that can come to compromises and that are no winners or losers, but agreements in place to help solve issues TOGETHER . If she has trouble with compromising on a proper solution now, what will happen when it comes to or much larger life decisions like buying a house or moving to a new city.", "For example, she told me I was too stubborn. This is definitely true but she criticized my political opinions, my social behaviors, and my pop culture opinions in addition to just my relationship with her. She also constantly mocks me when we fight, literally repeating my words back to me in a childish/cartoony voice and putting words in my mouth. She refuses to listen to my point of view. We recently got into a fight where I thought a Christmas present my father had gotten me was cheaper than it was.", "Many of my cohorts asked me \"how are you two even friends?\" when he came to which I couldn't give a clear answer. So in short, we have a business license and agreement we both signed. We were friends, but I think time has changed him and I and I don't think we would be friends if we met today. He isn't productive for the business and his practices many times seems to include emotion and his own self interests rather than the business, so I find him unfit as a business partner as well.", "Perhaps as a result I feel awful about wanting more from him, I feel like it's incredibly ungrateful of me because he does do so much good for me and is really good to me in so many ways. Especially with my depression and stuff he deals with a lot of household stuff in addition to working way more than I do. I feel like shit for writing this post. **TL;DR - SO of over a decade is great to me in many ways and shit to me in other ways, I feel awful when he's shit to me but also feel guilty as fuck about expressing it because of all the times he's amazing to me.

For drinks, luckily for me, there's a $0.25 soda machine beside the store. I also sign up for points cards cause they are very important for me to use later on.

His dad is a difficult person to begin with, which is well known by everyone and he kept making little jabs at me and insulting me. For example, he asked if I am a citizen and how long I have been one, I mentioned that I have never watched Harry Potter and he \"jokingly\" asked me if I was busy clubbing and talking to boys and doubted my upbringing, and when I was using my bfs phone, he asked me why I am using it and if I am reading his texts.

A summary of my bf: he is a complete workaholic, he loves me to death, he tells me how beautiful I am every day, he has dumped me 3 times because of my weight, he thinks I am an excuse maker and he does not know if he will commit to me.

The conversation started to heat up, nothing I said was enough, that we would buy something, that I would cook with her, that we could go 1 day earlier and cook at my grandma's, nothing.

Now, I know her brother can be pretty psychotic and from what shes told me he clearly has anger issues and the rest of her family keeps ignoring it, sometimes even enabling it. So 2 minutes into her exploding, she starts crying because apparently her brother told their dad something and the dad called her and said he doesn't trust her anymore or whatever. She was very upset about the dad thing because she's very close with her dad and she's her dads favorite child (he told me that himself when I spoke with him).

We have some social workers who try to help them get housing and have had some success. But until then, I'm considering stocking a stash of supplies at the food bank that aren't food, but could be particularly useful for people before they can get into housing. The idea isn't to provide kits instead of housing, but to stock items that might be occasionally useful. Most people are resourceful and provide for themselves, but occasionally may be short an item or two that could make a significant difference if it were immediately available.", "Am I being way overdramatic?

She had written questions to ask for a psychic reading or some such(she's into that stuff). One of them was, \"is this guy worth pursuing?\" \"This guy\" refers to an online friend from out of state she had been having extensive conversations with, which we had talked about not long before, and of course she labeled him as \"just a friend\", albeit him growing more and more fascinated with her. I offered an open relationship, partly because I had entertained the idea before, but mostly to de-escalate what could be a relationship ending event.", "I don't know why, because it didn't bother me before I actually saw it on a screen, but I am absolutely crushed. I've asked him to hide it from me from now on and expressed how hurt it was, but I went to use his gaming system a couple of days ago and saw he was still looking it up regularly (I guess he thought I wouldn't use it - I had gone to look up something and all the searches popped up in the Bing bar). I never felt attractive to him and I know that's my own fault and insecurity and not his problem to fix. I know rationally that men like variety.

I said he could come over to visit as often as he wanted, he just needs to tell me before hand so I can be home. We decided to give our relationship another shot and I got pregnant again immediately. We moved into a house together, I had really horrible morning sickness this time and Bob got disgusted with my neediness and moved out again a week later, leaving me in a huge house I can't afford or maintain, again far away from any form of support necessary for a pregnant mother of a young kid. He seems to love his kid very much but has no concept of taking responsibility.", "Do you think she's just trying to let me down easy or that there might be something but she's just not ready?

He immediately went into 30,000 debt building an unnecessary smithy and had to get a job so we couldn't start the business after all.
