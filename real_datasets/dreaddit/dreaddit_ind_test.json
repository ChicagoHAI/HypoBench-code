The second session he continued with this spending nearly 30 minutes saying I have 3 options, seeing a psychiatrist and taking pills, going to CBT to treat 'only the symptoms' or seeing a dynamic therapist like him for sessions which would take a year at least to see results.

Anyway, when I was 16 I started writing fanfiction about him based on the very imaginative music videos he had starred in for his songs.

The doctor I saw was amazing\u2014seriously I had no idea how to broach the topic and I felt 100% comfortable discussing my concerns from the moment I opened my mouth until I left the office.", "If you're interested in being interviewed for a story, please send me a DM.

Thank you.", "Either way, I can\u2019t see anyone genuinely liking me. My mum sincerely told me she loved me a few days ago, and I had a hard time believing that. I hate to diminish her own thoughts and feelings, but I felt as though she\u2019s deluded to be able to love me. Anxiety sucks. I wish I could look at things rationally and objectively.", "My brother adopted me and enrolled me in the school his wife taught at. They had a family of their own and I was never treated the same as their children. My future friends referred to them as \"the Dursleys.\" I was a few years older than their oldest kid so I attribute their shitty parenting to not knowing how to raise a kid my age at that point yet, because they were much kinder to their kids when they reached my age. They were also quite religious.", "My therapist says this is a normal behavior to display. Having been ripped from my children and left on the streets is very hard and i honeslty want to give up. But the anxiety swirls to the point i keep trying to find where i went wrong. It replays and plays in my head over and over like a horror movie. The feeling of wanting to die because at that point i had nothing left.", "If this is all I'm going to experience side-effect wise, then I regret not starting earlier. I really hope this will help with the anxiety, panic disorder, and depression. What are your experiences with antidepressants? Does it get worse?

I was incredibly lucky and got referred to a good psychologist that I like. He\u2019s helping me through the problems of getting rehabilitation welfare, which is a hassle because I constantly have to talk to new counselors, psychologists and psychiatrists which triggers breakdowns. I hate talking about myself to strangers, I\u2019m not ashamed at all, I just hate having to share how I truly feel with strangers. It makes it so real.", "It's been about a year and a half since the event that set my mental health for a loop. After going to group counseling for months with no improvement, I decided to seek out an individual therapist. I didn't get one until a almost year after the event itself. Now, finally, 5 months later, I've been able to see a psychiatrist who officially diagnosed me with generalized anxiety disorder, depression, and PTSD. I decided to get a workbook and my therapist and I are going to start the long journey of getting through my PTSD!", "It\u2019s only happened 3/4 times recently but I\u2019ve been putting off having sex and I\u2019m constantly worried that my girlfriend doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m into her or that I\u2019m losing interest, and so on. I\u2019ve only just mentioned to her that I might be struggling with some form of anxiety. It\u2019s a vicious circle at the moment. It\u2019s almost as if I can\u2019t relax and if I have nothing to worry about I create something to worry about. What do you guys think?", "An old friend invited me over to a small party she was having. You could say it was more of a get together, there were no more than 15 people at a time. It was only people I remember from years ago in MS and HS, or people I have met several times. The night was full of a series of moments that I will be kicking myself in the head for later-- starting with the fact that I introduced myself to someone with \"I haven't seen you in a while!\" and they said \"Oh really?", "Just looking acidentaly at news or pictures of weed in the web (specially while working) triggered this super anxious and horrible feeling. I would take around an hour or two to recover of this feeling. To this day I still suffer with this.

This is completly irrational.", "First and foremost, I am not a veteran. I found out about PTSD service dogs from my good friend who also suffers from PTSD and is in the process of training her pup to be a service dog. I have found some helpful resources online giving information about service dogs for PTSD, but most of them seem to be geared toward either: therapy dogs or PTSD dogs only for veterans. <url> \u27a1\ufe0f are all trainings this expensive? <url> \u27a1\ufe0f awesome article, but this website is also for veterans", "Recently my anxiety has gotten really bad, possibly the worse it has ever been and I\u2019ve been experiencing panic attacks, but I still can\u2019t justify taking my medication because I feel like I deserve to suffer. I also struggle with the feeling like I\u2019m making all this up and none of my problems exist which I know rationally cannot be true when I\u2019ve struggled with this for most my life, however I still can\u2019t shift it. I don\u2019t know if this is part of my anxiety making me feel like this or whether it is another thing I\u2019ve made myself believe. I guess I\u2019m just looking for some advice and reassurance.

I sort of think I have an idea of what I want to do, but I have no idea how to make it happen while still paying my bills so I've been applying to anything that seems like it might be relevant to me, but I'm not sure the right way to go about getting into a field I don't have a degree in. Because of this I feel trapped in my job right now and it gets so bad some days where I feel like just walking out and quitting or just not going in ever again. I'm rambling at this point, does anyone else deal with a job that makes them completely miserable? How do you deal with it?", "It's unfortunate we can't crosspost links from other subs like r/psychology to r/ptsd because sometimes a useful article comes along that might really help.

The flashbacks are better- less often and less intense. I have learned to manage the panic attacks at work - I have a process to deal with these events now, and they often work. But the reason I\u2019m really ok is because I don\u2019t push myself at all to make friends, or date, or expand my life beyond work and my small world. I can\u2019t expand it.", "I'm too unstable. Telling parents is not an option. I'm not going to give the easy redemption for them. All this is still suspicion. I know I'm no professional, but I'm telling you, I'll get help.", "For the past 15 years I have had some frantic events happen in my life which I did not think effected me that badly. About 5 years ago I started feeling small signs of PTSD but just brushed it off like it wasn\u2019t a real thing until it just kept getting worse and eating away at me, until I realized enough is enough. I thought maybe I have PTSD but then I would contradict myself and say that it\u2019s not real and I don\u2019t have it which would make me feel worse. I\u2019m finally getting help and yesterday for the first time in 15 years I have officially by a doctor been diagnosed with PTSD, it\u2019s weird to say this but for the first time ever I felt a sigh of relief like a weight was lifted off my shoulders.", "She wants to do anything she can do to help me, but it's up to the state, not her, to charge me.

Again understandable. I do buy the story because when the girl called, she told me nothing was going on beyond friendship and that they hadn't talked in forever, she said she herself was busy with a new relationship which why is they hadn't talked beyond simple texts here and there, which would explain why she didn't know he was dating me just until that moment.", "I'm in the seventh grade and I started an after school activity last trimester.

I am just too numb and burned out. I can love people but I can't fall in love with them. I can't give them what they need, the regular sex or the emotional intimacy, and I just end up feeling guilty.

There are many who use specific methods, and most didn't click, or had approaches I feel iffy about.

She's well-connected at my workplace, so gets lots of support from her \"friends\" who she talks to and presents this alternative reality to them about her \"version\" of situations. This is problematic, because she also needs disciplinary action because of bullying behavior toward other staff, customers, and myself, but any movement toward that leads to a tantrum. She presents herself as friendly and sympathetic - often the \"victim\" of the situation - so people believe her.

Anxiety and depression are considered commonplace, but I suspect many of those who consider themselves anxious or depressed are actually experiencing the fallout of trauma. Most therapists are not well trained to handle trauma, especially the complex kind that stems from prolonged exposure to abuse. Unless they are specially certified, they might have had a few hours in graduate school on Cluster B personality disorders, and even fewer hours on helping their survivors.

The reality is the more you own and verbalize things, the more control you have over it and the less over you. Bottom line is busting the stigma, no one should feel like they are alone.
