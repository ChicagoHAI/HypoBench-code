We don\u2019t live together (mutual decision). He wanted to marry me etc..and I started to see a change in his behavior ever since the move. He got flustered really easily or would get angry over something simple\u2014traffic or a common life situation. He seems to have no patience anymore, especially with me and will just shut down.", "But he doesn't ask, either. When I do open up, all I can think is \"He's probably bored and wishing I'll stop talking.\" or \"He hasn't contributed to this conversation once, why don't I just talk to a wall?\" I know he cares, he really does. He has voiced his frustration that he can't relate and that I struggle.", "I have a fear of fainting so I was like \u201cwhat if I fainted from so much fear during this test\u201d and next thing you know, worst panic attack of my life during the quiz and I failed it.

Definitely quitting the alcohol. It's an obvious trigger. But yeah, just wanted to ask his thread on your thoughts. Thanks", "I blame myself. Almost all the time. Especially when I feel bad, I see the uncomfortable feelings as wrong in the first place, and that it's my fault that I feel bad. This makes me feel worse. When I feel worse because I hate myself, I hate myself for hating myself for feeling bad.", "I find attractive qualities to pine after in literally everyone. So for a long time I thought I was pansexual, never focusing on the fact I lacked any interest in sex with the person. Maybe the desire to touch... But even kissing is weird for me and I back away from my husband when it gets too much... I'm also not super touch friendly, I think most.of that is my mental health and past...", "We had an argument, then he started trying to break my phone by bending it. I intervened and begged him not to and he stopped short of breaking it. I was a domestic violence victim before in a previous relationship and I buried those memories, but this incident made me remember some of those memories and I feel traumatized and scared to be experiencing the same things again. I feel scared and I don't know if this would escalate into something worse. We don't have kids, and we've been married for a couple months.", "I know there are no guarantees, but what medicine has worked for you? I really just want to feel better. They\u2019ve had me on Lexapro for the past 4 or so years but I think it\u2019s lost it\u2019s efficiency. All it does is keep me awake at night. I tried Celexa when I was about 15 or 16, but I was young and dumb and didn\u2019t take it when I was supposed to, so I guess I never really found out if it worked.", "When I try to befriend artists or thinkers or doers. They often either shun me because my work has been sub par and nearly non existant and they don't see me as equal. Or they show sexual/romantic interest I don't reciprocate which makes me nervous and avoidant. Sometimes I am shunmed I think because they mistake my interest in making friends for a romantic interest. I am quite annoyed by all the assumptions/game playing/projecting that goes on in the world.", "His response was to constantly remind me that \"not everything is about you\" and then taught me a technique which was to ask more questions in conversations because people always love talking about themselves. Anyway. I quit my antidepressants several months ago because I am in a good place now, and I can survive without them. I just find that thoughts like this are still very present, and can be very difficult to deal with. I never do apologize on Facebook.", "I've had anxiety for a few years (I'm seventeen) and only got diagnosed properly like 7 months ago alongside depression. Over the past few months I've developed a stutter and I've been unable to form proper sentences which has given me a fear of talking to friends and even just talking in general. I'm not the smartest person in my family and have got the lowest grades but I've always been excellent with my literacy but when I'm talking to either my family or friends, the words just can't come out. I've recently had something happen to nw  where I was used for comedy & told to \"try electro shock therapy\" to help my mental illnesses by some guy pretending to be there for me. This is only really related because this has made me really antisocial and I can't trust people anymore.", "&nbsp; This piece of art I\u2019ve used is a perfect example of how having solid boundaries can help me weather any storm. I know I\u2019m going to get kicked, I know I\u2019m going to be in pain but I also see the beauty in between the clouds. This is a painting I did freezing in the hail and storm on the rocks of Alloutte Lake. The waves crashed, the mist covered the mountains but every now and then brilliant colour would flash.", "Another issue is that both women are on the autism spectrum. My wife is quite high on it and the woman is quite low on it. My wife seems to think that there is nothing wrong with our marriage but we have not been intimate for 10 years. It's really hurting. I just don't want to hurt anyone but I know deep down that it's me that's hurt.", "when you first come face-to-face with a sociopath, you will be completely oblivious to who they truly are. they will be whoever they think you want them to be. they are fake. maybe it took him a while to show you his TRUE colors, maybe it was pretty close to the beginning. but the most important time was when you connected at the start.", "I legitimately do not know anyone who has survived this, and I feel like i'm not even human any more. As I type this, i'm sobbing, because it's all just so FUCKING truly disheartening. I used to be a person. I feel like a ghost now. Are there any steps I can take at all whatsoever to start my turn back into normalcy, or am I trapped inside of this until I either die or claw my way out of whatever hole i've fallen into?", "So I guess I'll jump right in. I have PTSD, and have for about 15 years with varying degrees of symptom severity after a sexual assault. Right now my symptoms are pretty well controlled and I am in regular therapy. Largely I am only dealing with nightmares and a heightened startle response and doing really well overall. In the last year I started dating an amazing man.", "But it happened. I literally had to take breathing exercise thingys because I felt like I was gonna pass out, my heart was racing. Now not all notifications scare me, like here, I won't really be too concerned. But still. I think the root of the problem is the sheer anonymity of when it alerts you a notification.", "Even when (now talking about other times) I tried to be playful and like scare prank him, he would beat me up for it. And I still looked up to him for some reason. I believe no child should ever experience these kinds of things. They always drag themselves into your future life. In my case, I have sworn to myself to never become like my father, but I still have these... well, issues.", "But I\u2019ve also had a lot of pain and it seems to be getting worse. It didn\u2019t use to last as long as it does now, I\u2019ve been lying in pain for hours. Nothing helps I\u2019ve taken painkillers and they haven\u2019t helped at all.. Should I mention this to a doctor? ?", "... My husband is an injured veteran. He was pretty seriously injured in Iraq and then again in Afghanistan (muscle tear and then a spinal injury.) However, the injuries occurred before we met. When we met, dated, and eventually married, he was under the influence of Vicodin, OxyContin, and Percocet.", "Not sure why but I\u2019m really off today. I can\u2019t stop feeling like a screw up even though I\u2019ve really done nothing wrong today. I feel like it might have been triggered by seeing an old family friend who asked how my abuser was or because I am having an injury flare up after doing really well. I just feel useless and unlovable. I have convinced myself even my husband doesn\u2019t like me.", "Today I logged on to my computer to have a few games with friends that I know. Before the games started I got into a discussion with a friend and a few points to take away from the conversation were: - People don't know how to react when I'm around because I'm overly sensitive. - People don't have the persistence to continue trying to help. - They don't feel like they can help so they've been avoiding me.", "I\u2019m in Florida, can\u2019t find concrete laws that apartment companies will let me off lease because of abuse. As in me getting my name off lease and him staying here. My fianc\u00e9 is mentally and emotionally abusive. We have had some physical altercations, like him pushing me down, poking me hard in the chest, him ripping off his shirt and than hitting me with it. He\u2019s also broken a few pairs of glasses, a remote control, smashed the hell out of his iPhone, and threw a chair across the room almost hitting his dog.", "Well, last time we fought, I did finally call. I was so fucking scared and while he hid in the basement with all the doors locked and light off, the cops took pictures of my hands and neck while I asked them over and over not to arrest him. They told me it will be up to the judge when he sees the pictures. Well, what do you know, he got a warrant. He didn't show up to the first court date so I know he's in even more trouble now.", "I live alone, make sure my dog gets the exercise he needs, I keep my apartment tidy, I do my laundry, I make sure I\u2019m eating good, I work out, and I still hang with friends and such. Really, the only time I play video games is after work (which is normally after 8:30pm) or when I\u2019m off. Even when I\u2019m off, I still do chores and such between playing games. Even though I\u2019m good at getting this stuff done, I still feel like there\u2019s this weight on my shoulders that I should do MORE. Even when I cut video games out of the equation (which I did for the last week and a half) I still don\u2019t do MORE because I\u2019m normally too tired to do anything else.", "That could be defeated by National Post printing a rebuttal, strongly worded and well researched (the antithesis of the illiterate vendetta piece Cosh wrote and Owens supported) explaining the science behind PTSD Service dogs: science that has been peer reviewed and minutely studied since 2002. But sadly, as of now the National Post refuses to stand by the oath of all journalists that speaks to integrity and education. &nbsp; >Brian here: If a politician said something this stupid, they\u2019d be sent for a sensitivity class and left off the nomination papers next election. A team player would be fined.", "The only truly good therapist I've been to was in Sweden, she listened, took extensive notes, remembered stuff and didn't talk about herself or her personal life. I need to see a therapist but I don't know what to do. I can't teach my therapists how to do their job nor should I feel like I need to in the first place. I also have chronic illnesses which makes it tiring (if not at times impossible) to have to constantly fight back against all my doctors to make sure they actually treat me and my symptoms and not just the numbers on my chart. It's gotten to the point where I'm really pessimistic about getting better or even being able to get good help.", "If you're stuck and too anxious to move just know that you are always making progress. It's okay to do it in your own way. I'm so grateful to this sub- it was really amazing to see that I wasn't alone in this. Reading other's struggles and accomplishments inspired me beyond belief. So I hope that if you're reading this you can find your own inspiration.", "The violence was still happening. The mind games were also still happening so I felt like it was my fault. That I had done something wrong to \u201cdeserve\u201d it. I supported both him and myself in this new state while he was in school. I ended up losing my job for reasons out of my control and had a really difficult time finding a new job.", "he was my best friend since highschool, she was a girl i really liked. my parents let him live at my house when his parents kicked him out, and he started dating the girl that i really liked behind my back. im not gonna go into too much detail about the drama but in short i kicked him out and they both hate me now. there were some not so nice comments going back and forth. the other day they moved into an apartment together after being together for like 3 months, but i just found out through the same person who initially told me that they were dating, his ex gf [22F] that he has hit her on several occasions.", "When I was a kid, I suffered a kind of unlikely injury that basically ruined me mentally, and it seems like I just CAN NOT get away from it, because it's such cheap gory shock value that everyone uses it when they need cheap gory shock value. And if I'm not mentally prepared to see it I have a panic attack or just start crying. A fucking jokey homebrew cursed item on r/DND did that to me today, and I hate that my trauma is so bad that I have to stay guarded even when I'm just reading a funny thread about my favorite hobby. I'm still thinking about that fucking item. I'm so tired.", "I try to take all opinions with a grain of salt, but \"incel\" isn't really an isolated trend, and there are more cases that it's part of the way our modern male/female gender system works. Also, I don't understand this, but questioning this stuff doesn't mean I hate all women. It doesn't even imply that. But doesn't everyone have a right to vent frustration? I want to talk more and give you more details.", "Now its personal so it hurts a lot more. There are nightmares where I am murdered, those don't hurt half as much as these. I woke up a few nights ago screaming because of it and I cried like an idiot until I realized it wasn't real. Figured I'd rant here instead of breaking my hands on my heavy bag. You guys ever get extremely worried about your partners safety to the point where it triggers you?", "Yes, you should! And we planned for that.

On Monday I was thinking about humans and how the brain works and it tripped me out I got worried that because I was thinking about how the brain works that I would lose sleep and I did. That night was bad just like last time.   Also yesterday my sleep was bad I woke up like every hour of the night just like last time. I got kind of scared like I did last time but this time I think that this is fake life which is absurd but I just think about it then get really scared then I think rationally then calm down.", "My sister is an alcoholic as well and also drinks too much, tho not as much as this fellow. I've never been comfortable with the level of her drinking or her personal choices and I live long distance from her. I try to nudge her in more positive directions and in the past 18 months have been offering a few hundred in financial support monthly to her to help her better provide for her kids. About 6 months ago, it came out that her boyfriend has been screaming in her face and laying his hands on her. Usually she beats him up as much or worse - I think it's pure insanity and I told her that she needed to make physical contact a 'red line' and if I heard about it, I would call the local police office and report him.", "There aren't a lot of people in my life I can talk to. I did have a therapist who I clicked with really well, but I had to stop seeing him when my work comp case closed. I just started seeing a new one but haven't gotten to the point where I really feel I can rely on her yet, as I've only seen her a couple of times. The crisis lines have been very unhelpful. I just need some support.", "When I asked her how it happened, she said her brother had accidentally elbowed her in the face when they were 'rough-housing'. There was something about the way she said it that seemed a bit off to me - like she had been practising her excuse (or maybe that was in my head). Whatever the case it struck me as maybe a little weird that a couple of 20-something siblings would be play-fighting with each other like 10 year olds. This morning, after an absence of several days, she arrived at the office with a broken wrist. Her arm is in a cast and she has metal rods holding the broken bones in place.", "am I writing it because it looks crazy or am I writing it because it's how i feel?~~ Maybe I can't word things clearly because it's my deepest thoughts. I'm going to try to write clearly because I feel like a fraud. I don't even know how to begin. I don't know the questions to ask.", "they will see that someone else is willing to do all the work for them. once you try to lead the way, you\u2019ll never stop because they will never take over for you. they will watch you do more & more for them until you are living your life completely for them. once you live for them, you become just like them. you will be completely controlled by them, not feeling comfortable being yourself.", "I had crippling anxiety and depression during my college years and finally managed to graduate within the allotted semesters after getting diagnosed and learning to cope . I'm about to go in for a set of interviews and wonder if i should be honest about why my grades dropped all of a sudden and got back to normal (fell into depression/anxiety cycle).

What was your personal experience? **TL;DR did you tell your boss about your mental health issues?", "(God bless.) He was very caring at a first glance, but as the relationship went on I started discovering deeper things about him. Please be understanding that at the time I dated this guy I was around 14 or 15. He got off to IRL gore. You may think, well that's weird, but that's not the abusive part.", "I'm anxious right now I hope my life won't be miserable this year. I can't believe I have to get my eyes checked because one of them is getting sore. My life should be about me, not about medical doctors. I really love the idea of pain and sickness (sarcasm) I'm just so bloody sick of the crap. I really am.", "So, for a few years now I've been in a relationship with this girl who very likely has PTSD, given her upbringing. She has trust issues after suffering abuse from her birth parents at a young age, and her situation is only complicated further with bipolar depression and fetal-alcohol syndrome. She's in good hands now, living with her aunt, and is becoming independent with a job. Though I've noticed throughout our relationship that she has a tendency to push me away l, whereas I am the exact opposite, though I understand her situation; it's not her fault. She says she loves me, and I love her, but she doesn't seem comfortable showing any affection; holding hands, hugging, and kisses on the cheek are extremely rare from her.", "All of these things were a slow burn, many of these things overlapped one another. I pushed through and finished my PhD, but now I'm worn, and after looking into it, I've realized that the psychological symptoms of stress I display are closely aligned with racism-specific PTSD. I've been through psychotherapy, but I'm not sure the therapist was adequately prepared to identify it, but I know for certain that I have PTSD. I want to begin healing now that I'm done with grad school. Where/how do I start?", "I phoned my actual therapist, but mostly I sat alone and chained smoked, if someone talked to me I tried to be nice and polite, and I simply reminded myself that all the evidence showed this would be possible in September, that only by acting out could I fuck it up. So I left well, pretending hopefulness I did not feel, with everyone's well wishes. Now I return tomorrow. Disability is paying for my ride, I am taking the train for the first time. It was really a wonderful place.", "I even tried to settle this outside of their insurance so that their insurance rates wouldn't go up. I feel afraid every time it becomes nighttime and when I have to go to school, because I know there is a chance I may see him again. I don't know how to stop thinking about what happened that night, what I could have done differently, or what would have happened if someone had come to save me. It's hard to tell my family I've begun to think about killing myself again. I've struggled with depression for years and this incident has only made it so much worse.", "Again, most of the time I can just say 'ah, screw 'em they're not a doctor' but you know how it goes when you're having an episode. Phew, ok! Sorry for such a long post, I just usually like long reads on Reddit so I figure it's ok. Feel free to share your experiences with feeling \"fake!\" It's good to not feel alone. TL;DR I sometimes feel like I'm faking having PTSD despite never expecting I had it and then getting an official diagnosis from a doctor.", "I just feel so naked and unprotected. WIll this be any different with the therapist? After all I don't even know if I want to go to this therapy session, I'm so confused about myself it's unbelievable.

I feel like I should give a little background. About 7-8 months ago I left my abusive ex-girlfriend, she was my first serious partner and we were together for about a year and a half. She pretty much ruined my life, and I experienced all kinds of abuse while I was with her (and even when we were apart), including emotional, mental and physical. Fast forward to today, I have a new relationship with the sweetest girl in the world, a brand new start since I\u2019m a freshman in college, and there\u2019s a good chance that I will never have to speak with or maybe even see my ex for a good while.", "I\u2019m struggling to figure out what\u2019s wrong with me at the moment.
