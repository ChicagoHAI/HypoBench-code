Initial head computed tomography (CT) performed in the emergency department showed vasogenic edema in the right temporal parietal region, which prompted her transfer to our institution for additional work-up. Further history taking revealed recurrent transient motor and sensory transient ischemic attack-like symptoms over the preceding weeks. She denied having a fever or night sweats. There was no history of infection, bleeding, immunodeficiency, intravenous drug use, alcohol or tobacco abuse, malignancy, or genetic disorders. Her medical history included memory impairment and a left posterior cerebral artery territory infarction. She was not known to have any systemic inflammatory disorder. Physical examination findings at presentation were noncontributory. She was not taking any anticoagulants or immunosuppressive medication. Pertinent hematologic laboratory investigations revealed a white blood cell count of 6.7 \u00d7 10(9), a C-reactive protein level of 29 mg/L (276.2 nmol/L) (normal value, <10 mg/L [95.2 nmol/L]), and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 35 mm per hour (normal value, 0-10 mm per hour). Shortly after this patient was admitted to our institution, she had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the brain was performed the next day.", "To evaluate tumor response by means of volumetric assessment, survival, and changes in patient symptoms after the treatment of unresectable and/or recurrent pleural mesothelioma by using regional nonselective transarterial chemoperfusion as a palliative treatment option.This retrospective study was approved by the hospital ethical committee, and all patients signed an informed consent prior to treatment. Thirty-nine patients (mean age, 64.0 years; 10 women and 29 men) with unresectable pleural mesothelioma were treated with repetitive transarterial chemoperfusion between March 2007 and March 2010, with a mean of 2.9 sessions per patient at 4-week intervals. Transarterial chemoperfusion was performed by using mitomycin C, cisplatin, and gemcitabine. Computed tomography findings and patient symptoms were evaluated. Tumor response was evaluated by using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors guidelines, and survival was assessed with the Kaplan-Meier method. The change in volume for the partial-response group was tested by using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.In 36% of treated tumors (14 of 39), partial response was achieved, and tumor volume decreased from a mean value \u00b1 standard deviation of 839.6 mL \u00b1 590.3 (range, 3.9-1972.2 mL) to 137 mL \u00b1 399.8 (range, 0.88-1131.4; P = .00012). In 49% of tumors (19 of 39), stable disease was noted. In 15% of tumors (six of 39), progressive disease was seen. Mean specific growth rate of the tumor was 0.00158% per day. The mean survival time was 14.2 months (range, 2.1-33.1 months) from the start of treatment. For patients with tumors that responded to treatment, mean survival time was 15 months (range, 4.5-33.1 months). Mean time to disease progression was 2.6 months for all tumors, 1.5 months for stable disease, and 1.3 months for progressive disease.Transarterial chemoperfusion may have the potential to yield positive results and response in the treatment of recurrent and/or unresectable pleural mesothelioma. \u00a9 RSNA, 2012.", "To detect adoptively transferred immune attack in a mouse model of islet cell transplantation by using a long-circulating paramagnetic T1 contrast agent, a protected graft copolymer (PGC) that is covalently linked to gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Gd-DTPA-F), which accumulates in the sites of inflammation that are characterized by vascular disruption.All animal experiments were performed in compliance with institutional guidelines and approved by the subcommittee on research animal care. Six nonobese diabetic severe combined immunodeficiency mice received transplanted human islet cells under the kidney capsule and adoptively transferred 5 \u00d7 10(6) splenocytes from 6-week-old nonobese diabetic mice. These mice also served as control subjects for comparison of pre- and postadoptive transfer MR imaging results. Mice that received phosphate-buffered saline solution only were included as nonadoptive-transfer control subjects (n = 2). In vivo magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed before and 17 hours after intravenous injections of PGC-Gd-DTPA-F, followed by histologic examination. Statistical differences were analyzed by means of a paired Student t test and repeated two-way analysis of variance.MR imaging results showed significantly greater accumulation of PGC-Gd-DTPA-F in the graft area after immune attack initiated by adoptive transfer of splenocytes compared with that of the same area before the transfer (T1, 137.2 msec \u00b1 39.3 and 239.5 msec \u00b1 17.6, respectively; P < .001). These results were confirmed at histologic examination, which showed considerable leakage of the contrast agent into the islet cell interstitium.PGC-Gd-DTPA-F-enhanced MR imaging allows for the in vivo assessment of vascular damage of the graft T cell challenge.", "To evaluate the diagnostic potential of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM)-derived parameters for differentiation of common pancreatic tumors, chronic pancreatitis, and normal pancreas and for characterization of the malignancy potential of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs).The institutional review board approved this retrospective study, and informed consent was waived. Ninety-three consecutive patients with surgically resected and pathologically confirmed pancreatic tumors (39 pancreatic adenocarcinomas [PACs], 17 neuroendocrine tumors [NETs], and 37 IPMNs), seven patients with chronic pancreatitis, and 26 patients with a normal pancreas were included in this study. All patients underwent pancreatic 3.0-T magnetic resonance imaging, including IVIM diffusion-weighted imaging with 10 b values used (from 0 to 1000 sec/mm(2)). The ADC, slow component of diffusion (D(slow)), incoherent microcirculation (D(fast)), and perfusion fraction (f) were calculated. Steel-Dwass and Mann-Whitney U tests were used for comparison. The diagnostic performance of the parameters was evaluated by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis with Bonferroni correction.Among ADC- and IVIM-derived parameters, D(fast) and f values of PACs were significantly lower than those of normal pancreas, chronic pancreatitis, and NETs (all P < .05 in post hoc analyses). For differentiation of PACs from NETs, f and D(fast) showed a significant difference (P < .0001 for both) and were more useful parameters than ADC and D(slow) in ROC analysis (all P < .05). Malignant IPMNs had significantly lower ADC and D(slow) values and higher D(fast) and f values when compared with benign IPMNs (all P < .05). In ROC analysis, f showed the highest area under the ROC curve value for distinguishing malignant from benign IPMNs.IVIM-derived perfusion-related parameters could be helpful for the differentiation of common malignant tumors in the pancreas and for distinguishing malignant from benign IPMNs. D(fast) and f were more valuable parameters in the differentiation of PACs from NETs than were ADC and D(slow).", "To retrospectively evaluate the adherence of radiologists to the 2010 Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound (SRU) guidelines for management of adnexal cysts.One radiologist reviewed the interpreting radiologists' reports for 398 adnexal cysts detected at ultrasonography in 398 patients (mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 41.1 years \u00b1 14.3; range, 18-87 years) and classified the management recommendations according to adherence to SRU guidelines. Recommendations that were not adherent were classified as overmanagement, undermanagement, or incomplete. The effects of menopausal status, cyst size and other features, and the individual interpreting radiologist on adherence were assessed by using \u03c7(2) tests, and the association of these factors with over- and undermanagement was identified.Overall adherence was 59%; overmanagement, 27%; undermanagement, 9%; and incomplete, 6%. Menopausal status, cyst size, and other cyst features significantly affected adherence (P < .001). For evaluation of premenopausal patients, adherence was 63% (overmanagement, 30%) and of postmenopausal patients, 42% (undermanagement, 26%). For evaluation of cysts 1-3 cm in size, adherence was 65% (overmanagement, 21%); for cysts 3-5 cm, 33% (overmanagement, 49%); for cysts 5-7 cm, 47% (overmanagement, 20%); for cysts larger than 7 cm, 77% (over- and undermanagement, 12% each). Recommendations were adherent in most instances for corpora lutea (88%), simple cysts (56%), and cysts suggestive of benign diagnosis (60%), or with a nodule or multiple thin or thick septations (60%-100%). Cysts with recommentations for overmanagement in most instances were hemorrhagic (59%) and those with a single thin septation (67%); 31% of cysts measuring 1-7 cm in postmenopausal patients were undermanaged. Adherence varied significantly among radiologists (40%-75% adherence among radiologists who interpreted 20 or more examinations; P = .004).Adherence to SRU guidelines for management of adnexal cysts at our institution was 59%. Overmanagement generally occurred for physiologic cysts in premenopausal patients; undermanagement was observed for simple cysts in postmenopausal patients.", "Purpose To determine whether changes in coronary opacification normalized to the aorta (corrected coronary opacification [CCO]) across stents can help identify in-stent restenosis (ISR) severity with use of invasive coronary angiography as the standard of reference. Materials and Methods This study was approved by the institutional review board, and the requirement to obtain informed consent was waived. The authors retrospectively analyzed 106 patients (88 men, 18 women; mean age, 59.6 years \u00b1 10.4; age range, 36\u201384 years) who had previously undergone stent implantation within 3 months of coronary computed tomographic (CT) angiography. Attenuation values in the coronary lumen were measured proximal and distal to the stents and normalized to the descending aorta. The CCO difference across the stent was compared with the severity of ISR. One-way analysis of variance least significant difference was used for comparison. Results A total of 141 stents were assessed. Seventy-six stents were normally patent, 18 had ISR of less than 50%, 28 had ISR of 50%\u201399%, and 19 were fully occluded. The median CCO differences in the four groups were 0.078, 0.163, 0.346, and 0.606, respectively. There was no significant difference between stents with an ISR of at least 50% and those with total occlusion (P = .056), although the other groups had significant differences at pairwise comparison (P < .01 for all). For stents smaller than 3 mm in diameter, the median CCO differences in the four groups were 0.086, 0.136, 0.390, and 0.471, respectively. The CCO differences across normal stents and stents with ISR of less than 50% were significantly less than those across stents with an ISR of at least 50% and those with total occlusion (P < .01 for all). There were no significant differences between stents with no ISR and those with an ISR of less than 50% (P = .821) and between stents with an ISR of at least 50% and those with an ISR of 100% (P = .836). Conclusion The CCO difference across coronary stents is related to ISR severity in obstructive ISR in stents smaller than 3 mm in diameter. \u00a9 RSNA, 2014", "To evaluate the role of core-needle biopsy (CNB) in thyroid nodules with nondiagnostic results at previous fine-needle aspiration (FNA).From October 2008 to July 2011, 155 nodules from 155 patients (37 men, 118 women) with a mean age of 51.8 years (age range, 22-76 years) with nondiagnostic results at previous FNA were reviewed retrospectively. The Bethesda system for reporting thyroid cytopathologic results was used to assign FNA and CNB findings. Malignant nodules (n = 37) were diagnosed after surgery. Benign nodules (n = 79) were diagnosed either after surgery, with benign findings after FNA and/or CNB that had been repeated at least twice, or after benign cytology findings at FNA or CNB with a stable size at follow-up. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of ultrasonographically guided CNB were evaluated.At CNB, two nodules (1.3%) showed nondiagnostic results, and 135 nodules (87.1%) had conclusive diagnoses. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of core biopsies for the detection of malignancy were 94.6% (35 of 37), 100% (79 of 79), 100% (35 of 35), 97.5% (79 of 81), and 98.3% (114 of 116), respectively. For 28 nodules, nondiagnostic results were found after two or more FNA procedures; however, diagnostic surgery was performed in only one patient.CNB of the thyroid nodule demonstrates high rates of conclusive and accurate diagnoses in patients for whom previous FNA results were nondiagnostic, thereby reducing the need for unnecessary diagnostic surgery.", "Purpose To assess the ability of an engineered epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)\u2013binding fibronectin domain to serve as a positron emission tomographic (PET) probe for molecular imaging of EGFR in a xenograft mouse model. Materials and Methods An EGFR-binding fibronectin domain (fibronectin abbreviated to Fn when bound) was site-specifically labeled with copper 64 (64Cu) (8 MBq/nmol). Copper 64\u2013Fn binding was tested in cell cultures with varying EGFR expression. Stability in human and mouse serum was measured in vitro. Animal experiments were approved by the Stanford University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Copper 64\u2013Fn (approximately 2 MBq) was used for PET in mice (n = 5) bearing EGFR-overexpressing xenografted tumors (approximately 5\u201310 mm in diameter). Results of tomography were compared with those of ex vivo gamma counting of dissected tissues. Statistical analysis was performed with t tests and adjustment for multiple comparisons. Results Copper 64\u2013Fn exhibited EGFR-dependent binding to multiple cell lines in culture. The tracer was stable for 24 hours in human and mouse serum at 37\u00b0C. The tracer exhibited good tumor localization (3.4% injected dose [ID]/g \u00b1 1.0 [standard deviation] at 1 hour), retention (2.7% ID/g \u00b1 0.6 at 24 hours), and specificity (8.6 \u00b1 3.0 tumor-to-muscle ratio, 8.9 \u00b1 4.7 tumor-to-blood ratio at 1 hour). Specific targeting was verified with low localization to low-expressing MDA-MB-435 tumors (0.7% ID/g \u00b1 0.8 at 1 hour, P = .018); specificity was further demonstrated, as a nonbinding control fibronectin had low localization to EGFR-overexpressing xenografts (0.8% ID/g \u00b1 0.2 at 1 hour, P = .013). Conclusion The stability, low background, and target-specific tumor uptake and retention of the engineered fibronectin domain make it a promising EGFR molecular imaging agent. More broadly, it validates the fibronectin domain as a potential scaffold for a generation of various molecular imaging agents. \u00a9 RSNA, 2012 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.12111504/-/DC1", "To assess the incremental value of diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging over T2-weighted MR imaging at 3 T for prostate cancer detection and to investigate the use of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) to characterize tumor aggressiveness, with whole-mount step-section pathologic analysis as the reference standard.The Internal Review Board approved this HIPAA-compliant retrospective study and waived informed consent. Fifty-one patients with prostate cancer (median age, 58 years; range, 46-74 years) underwent T2-weighted MR imaging and DW MR imaging (b values: 0 and 700 sec/mm(2) [n = 20] or 0 and 1000 sec/mm(2) [n = 31]) followed by prostatectomy. The prostate was divided into 12 regions; two readers provided a score for each region according to their level of suspicion for the presence of cancer on a five-point scale, first using T2-weighted MR imaging alone and then using T2-weighted MR imaging and the ADC map in conjunction. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) were estimated to evaluate performance. Generalized estimating equations were used to test the ADC difference between benign and malignant prostate regions and the association between ADCs and tumor Gleason scores.For tumor detection, the AUCs for readers 1 and 2 were 0.79 and 0.76, respectively, for T2-weighted MR imaging and 0.79 and 0.78, respectively, for T2-weighted MR imaging plus the ADC map. Mean ADCs for both cancerous and healthy prostatic regions were lower when DW MR imaging was performed with a b value of 1000 sec/mm(2) rather than 700 sec/mm(2). Regardless of the b value used, there was a significant difference in the mean ADC between malignant and benign prostate regions. A lower mean ADC was significantly associated with a higher tumor Gleason score (mean ADCs of [1.21, 1.10, 0.87, and 0.69] \u00d7 10(-3) mm(2)/sec were associated with Gleason score of 3 + 3, 3 + 4, 4 + 3, and 8 or higher, respectively; P = .017).Combined DW and T2-weighted MR imaging had similar performance to T2-weighted MR imaging alone for tumor detection; however, DW MR imaging provided additional quantitative information that significantly correlated with prostate cancer aggressiveness.", "Purpose To compare the diagnostic performance of two-dimensional (2D) mammography, 2D mammography plus digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), and synthetic 2D mammography plus DBT in depicting malignant radiographic features. Materials and Methods In this multicenter, multireader, retrospective reading study (the TOMMY trial), after written informed consent was obtained, 8869 women (age range, 29\u201385 years; mean, 56 years) were recruited from July 2011 to March 2013 in an ethically approved study. From these women, a reading dataset of 7060 cases was randomly allocated for independent blinded review of (a) 2D mammography images, (b) 2D mammography plus DBT images, and (c) synthetic 2D mammography plus DBT images. Reviewers had no access to results of previous examinations. Overall sensitivities and specificities were calculated for younger women and those with dense breasts. Results Overall sensitivity was 87% for 2D mammography, 89% for 2D mammography plus DBT, and 88% for synthetic 2D mammography plus DBT. The addition of DBT was associated with a 34% increase in the odds of depicting cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 1.34, P = .06); however, this level did not achieve significance. For patients aged 50\u201359 years old, sensitivity was significantly higher (P = .01) for 2D mammography plus DBT than it was for 2D mammography. For those with breast density of 50% or more, sensitivity was 86% for 2D mammography compared with 93% for 2D mammography plus DBT (P = .03). Specificity was 57% for 2D mammography, 70% for 2D mammography plus DBT, and 72% for synthetic 2D mammography plusmDBT. Specificity was significantly higher than 2D mammography (P < .001in both cases) and was observed for all subgroups (P < .001 for all cases). Conclusion The addition of DBT increased the sensitivity of 2D mammography in patients with dense breasts and the specificity of 2D mammography for all subgroups. The use of synthetic 2D DBT demonstrated performance similar to that of standard 2D mammography with DBT. DBT is of potential benefit to screening programs, particularly in younger women with dense breasts. \u00a9 RSNA, 2015", "Purpose To assess cancer detection rates, false-positive rates before arbitration, positive predictive values for women recalled after arbitration, and the type of cancers detected with use of digital mammography alone and combined with tomosynthesis in a large prospective screening trial. Materials and Methods A prospective, reader- and modality-balanced screening study of participants undergoing combined mammography plus tomosynthesis, the results of which were read independently by four different radiologists, is under way. The study was approved by a regional ethics committee, and all participants provided written informed consent. The authors performed a preplanned interim analysis of results from 12631 examinations interpreted by using mammography alone and mammography plus tomosynthesis from November 22, 2010, to December 31, 2011. Analyses were based on marginal log-linear models for binary data, accounting for correlated interpretations and adjusting for reader-specific performance levels by using a two-sided significance level of .0294. Results Detection rates, including those for invasive and in situ cancers, were 6.1 per 1000 examinations for mammography alone and 8.0 per 1000 examinations for mammography plus tomosynthesis (27% increase, adjusted for reader; P = .001). False-positive rates before arbitration were 61.1 per 1000 examinations with mammography alone and 53.1 per 1000 examinations with mammography plus tomosynthesis (15% decrease, adjusted for reader; P < .001). After arbitration, positive predictive values for recalled patients with cancers verified later were comparable (29.1% and 28.5%, respectively, with mammography alone and mammography plus tomosynthesis; P = .72). Twenty-five additional invasive cancers were detected with mammography plus tomosynthesis (40% increase, adjusted for reader; P < .001). The mean interpretation time was 45 seconds for mammography alone and 91 seconds for mammography plus tomosynthesis (P < .001). Conclusion The use of mammography plus tomosynthesis in a screening environment resulted in a significantly higher cancer detection rate and enabled the detection of more invasive cancers. \u00a9RSNA, 2013 Clinical trial registration no. NCT01248546", "Although investigators in the imaging community have been active in developing and evaluating quantitative imaging biomarkers (QIBs), the development and implementation of QIBs have been hampered by the inconsistent or incorrect use of terminology or methods for technical performance and statistical concepts. Technical performance is an assessment of how a test performs in reference objects or subjects under controlled conditions. In this article, some of the relevant statistical concepts are reviewed, methods that can be used for evaluating and comparing QIBs are described, and some of the technical performance issues related to imaging biomarkers are discussed. More consistent and correct use of terminology and study design principles will improve clinical research, advance regulatory science, and foster better care for patients who undergo imaging studies.", "Purpose To compare a glycosaminoglycan chemical exchange saturation transfer (gagCEST) imaging method, which enables sampling of the water signal as a function of the presaturation offset (z-spectrum) at 13 points in clinically feasible imaging times, with sodium 23 (23Na) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in patients after cartilage repair surgery (matrix-associated autologous chondrocyte transplantation and microfracture therapy). Materials and Methods One female patient (67.3 years), and 11 male patients (median age, 28.8 years; interquartile range [IQR], 24.6\u201332.3 years) were examined with a 7-T whole-body system, with approval of the local ethics committee after written informed consent was obtained. A modified three-dimensional gradient-echo sequence and a 28-channel knee coil were used for gagCEST imaging. 23Na imaging was performed with a circularly polarized knee coil by using a modified gradient-echo sequence. Statistical analysis of differences and Spearman correlation were applied. Results The median of asymmetries in gagCEST z-spectra summed over all offsets from 0 to 1.3 ppm was 7.99% (IQR, 6.33%\u20138.79%) in native cartilage and 5.13% (IQR, 2.64%\u20136.34%) in repair tissue. A strong correlation (r = 0.701; 95% confidence interval: 0.21, 0.91) was found between ratios of signal intensity from native cartilage to signal intensity from repair tissue obtained with gagCEST or 23Na imaging. The median of dimensionless ratios between native cartilage and repair tissue was 1.28 (IQR, 1.20\u20131.58) for gagCEST and 1.26 (IQR, 1.21\u20131.48) for 23Na MR imaging. Conclusion The high correlation between the introduced gagCEST method and 23Na imaging implies that gagCEST is a potentially useful biomarker for glycosaminoglycans. \u00a9 RSNA, 2011 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.11101841/-/DC1", "Purpose To report the incidence of cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT) in a prospective cohort of preterm infants with a gestational age of less than 29 weeks. Materials and Methods The local medical ethics review board approved this study, and written parental consent was obtained. Preterm infants with a gestational age of less than 29 weeks who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit were prospectively studied with cranial ultrasonography (US). The scanning protocol included visualization with color Doppler imaging of the superior sagittal sinus and transverse sinuses through the anterior (8.5-MHz probe) and mastoid (13-MHz probe) fontanelles. When feasible, magnetic resonance imaging was performed to confirm cranial US-diagnosed CSVT. The differences between preterm infants with and those without CSVT were analyzed by using Mann-Whitney tests for continuous variables and Fisher exact tests for categorical data. Results Cranial US was used to document CSVT in 11 of 249 preterm infants with a gestational age of less than 29 weeks. Transverse sinuses were most frequently affected (in all 11 patients with CSVT). All infants with CSVT were asymptomatic. Postnatal age at diagnosis ranged from 5 to 34 days. The mean gestational age was significantly lower in infants with CSVT (25.9 weeks vs 26.8 weeks, P = .038). Of the risk factors studied, only duration of mechanical ventilation was associated with CSVT; it was significantly longer in the CSVT group. Conclusion Systematic serial cranial US of infants with a gestational age of less than 29 weeks showed a remarkably high incidence of CSVT of 4.4%. Cranial US including color Doppler imaging with scans obtained through the mastoid fontanelle can depict CSVT at an early stage. Treatment of this possibly important condition needs attention. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013", "History A 55-year-old woman presented to our breast clinic with 1-year history of lancinating pain in the right breast that was exacerbated by blunt pressure and cold temperature. She denied any family history of breast cancer or any personal history of trauma, infection, or surgery of the breast. On clinical examination, exquisite pain was generated by simple light pressure over the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. Mammography and ultrasounography (US) with Doppler analysis of the right breast were painful but were performed with the least pressure possible.", "To investigate alterations in functional connectivity in the resting brain networks in healthy elderly volunteers and patients with mild, moderate, or severe Alzheimer Disease (AD).This study was approved by the institutional ethics committee, and informed consent was obtained. Forty-six patients with AD and 16 healthy elderly volunteers were prospectively examined. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to detect alterations in posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) functional connectivity through a comparison of the healthy control group with three separate AD groups-mild, moderate, and severe AD. A temporal correlation method was used to obtain PCC connectivity maps.Dissociated functional connectivity between the PCC and a set of regions, including the visual cortices bilaterally, the inferior temporal cortex, the hippocampus, and especially the medial prefrontal cortex and the precuneus and/or cuneus, was observed in all AD groups. The disruption of connectivity intensified as the stage of AD progression increased. There were also regions that exhibited increased connectivity; these regions extended from left lateralized frontoparietal regions and spread to bilateral frontoparietal regions along with AD progression.Changes in PCC functional connectivity comprised bidirectional alterations in the resting networks in AD-affected brains, and the impaired resting functional connectivity seemed to change with AD progression. Therefore, alterations in functional connectivity in the default mode network might play a role in the progression of AD.", "To determine the proportion of children and young adults in whom the thymus extends superiorly above the level of the manubrium into the anterior cervical tissues on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging studies.This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and written consent was waived. Sagittal proton density-weighted images from MR imaging examinations of the neck and upper chest were obtained for various indications in 200 consecutive patients (121 male and 79 female; mean age, 9.0 years; interquartile range, 5.2-14.2). Images were retrospectively reviewed for frequency of superior extension of the thymus above the manubrium into the lower neck. When present, the greatest sagittal distance of the cervical extension was measured. Associated deformity of the trachea or great vessels was recorded as absent or present. The association between frequency of cervical extension and age group and sex was evaluated for statistically significant correlation by using chi(2) tests and multiple logistic regression.One hundred thirty-three (66.5%) patients had superior cervical extension of the thymus. The mean distance of the extension above the manubrium was 20.1 mm +/- 6.76 (standard deviation). There was a statistically significant relationship between younger age groups and higher frequency of cervical extension of the thymus (P < .0001). Sex was not a statistically significant factor (P = .1645). No tracheal or vascular deformity was seen in any patient.Superior cervical extension of the thymus above the manubrium into the lower neck is normal anatomy in children and young adults. This finding should not be misinterpreted as a pathologic mass.", "To investigate the relationship between spiculated masses at mammography and marginal adipose tissue invasion at histologic examination.The institutional review board approved this retrospective study, and the requirement to obtain informed consent was waived. A total of 478 patients with invasive breast cancer who underwent surgery between 1999 and 2009 were included in this study. Clinical-pathologic findings from patients with spiculated masses on mammograms were compared with those from patients without spiculated masses by using logistic regression models, Cox proportional hazards regression models, and the Kaplan-Meier method.There were 136 spiculated tumors and 342 nonspiculated tumors. All 136 spiculated tumors (100%) were positive for adipose tissue invasion, whereas only 264 of the 342 nonspiculated tumors (77%) were positive for adipose tissue invasion (P < .001). Multivariate analysis revealed that adipose tissue invasion (P < .001), histologic grade (P < .001), dense breast (P = .002), and body mass index (P = .02) were independent factors associated with spiculation. With regard to survival, although many patients with spiculated tumors had a hormone-sensitive (estrogen receptor positive: P = .004; progesterone receptor positive: P = .001) or low-grade (P < .001) tumor, in contrast to the patients without spiculated masses, the prognosis in the two groups was similar (disease-free survival: P = .09; overall survival: P = .23).Cancer cell interaction with adipose tissue is crucial for the finding of spiculation at mammography.", "Purpose To compare the time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who are undergoing sorafenib treatment combined with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) versus sorafenib monotherapy. Materials and Methods The retrospective analysis of the data was approved by the institutional review board, and the requirement to obtain informed consent was waived. Of 355 patients with advanced-stage HCC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C) who were undergoing sorafenib therapy for at least 5 weeks between April 2007 and July 2011, 164 (46.2%) underwent repeat TACE (or chemolipiodolization if indicated) along with sorafenib therapy (combined group); the remaining 191 patients (53.8%) received sorafenib alone (monotherapy group). The median patient age was 53 years (range, 22\u201384 years). The median age was 53 years (range, 26\u201384 years) for men and 56 years (range, 22\u201375 years) for women. Propensity score\u2013based methods were used to minimize bias when evaluating TTP on the basis of modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors and OS. Statistical analysis was performed with the Kaplan-Meier method by using the log-rank test and Cox regression models. Results In the combined and monotherapy groups, respectively, 64.6% and 49.2% of patients had vascular invasion, 87.8% and 91.1% had extrahepatic metastasis, and 54.3% and 47.1% had both. During follow-up (median duration, 5.5 months), the median TTP and OS in the combined group were longer than those in the monotherapy group (TTP: 2.5 months vs 2.1 months, respectively, P = .008; OS: 8.9 months vs 5.9 months, P = .009). At univariate and subsequent multivariate analyses, additional TACE was an independent predictor of favorable TTP and OS (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.74 and 0.57, respectively; P < .05 for both), consistent with the outcomes of inverse probability of treatment weighting. In the propensity score\u2013matched cohort (96 pairs), the median TTP in the combined group was significantly longer than that in the monotherapy group (2.7 months vs 2.1 months, respectively; P = .011), but median OS was not (9.1 months vs 6.7 months, P = .21). Conclusion In this retrospective study, TACE plus sorafenib was superior to sorafenib alone with respect to TTP in patients with advanced-stage HCC, although it may or may not improve OS. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Supplemental material: S1", "To compare diagnostic accuracy of T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with that of multiparametric (MP) MR imaging combining T2-weighted imaging with diffusion-weighted (DW) MR imaging, dynamic contrast material-enhanced (DCE) MR imaging, or both in the detection of locally recurrent prostate cancer (PCa) after radiation therapy (RT).This retrospective HIPAA-compliant study was approved by the institutional review board; informed consent was waived. Fifty-three men (median age, 70 years) suspected of having post-RT recurrence of PCa underwent MP MR imaging, including DW and DCE sequences, within 6 months after biopsy. Two readers independently evaluated the likelihood of PCa with a five-point scale for T2-weighted imaging alone, T2-weighted imaging with DW imaging, T2-weighted imaging with DCE imaging, and T2-weighted imaging with DW and DCE imaging, with at least a 4-week interval between evaluations. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated. Interreader agreement was assessed, and quantitative parameters (apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC], volume transfer constant [K(trans)], and rate constant [k(ep)]) were assessed at sextant- and patient-based levels with generalized estimating equations and the Wilcoxon rank sum test, respectively.At biopsy, recurrence was present in 35 (66%) of 53 patients. In detection of recurrent PCa, T2-weighted imaging with DW imaging yielded higher AUCs (reader 1, 0.79-0.86; reader 2, 0.75-0.81) than T2-weighted imaging alone (reader 1, 0.63-0.67; reader 2, 0.46-0.49 [P \u2264 .014 for all]). DCE sequences did not contribute significant incremental value to T2-weighted imaging with DW imaging (reader 1, P > .99; reader 2, P = .35). Interreader agreement was higher for combinations of MP MR imaging than for T2-weighted imaging alone (\u03ba = 0.34-0.63 vs \u03ba = 0.17-0.20). Medians of quantitative parameters differed significantly (P < .0001 to P = .0233) between benign tissue and PCa (ADC, 1.64 \u00d7 10(-3) mm(2)/sec vs 1.13 \u00d7 10(-3) mm(2)/sec; K(trans), 0.16 min(-1) vs 0.33 min(-1); k(ep), 0.36 min(-1) vs 0.62 min(-1)).MP MR imaging has greater accuracy in the detection of recurrent PCa after RT than T2-weighted imaging alone, with no additional benefit if DCE is added to T2-weighted imaging and DW imaging.", "To determine whether the relationship between pulmonary function and computed tomographic (CT) lung attenuation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is traditionally described with single univariate and multivariate statistical models, could be more accurately described with a multiple model estimation approach.The study was approved by the local ethics committee. All participants provided written informed consent. The prediction of the percentage area with CT attenuation values less than -950 HU at inspiration (%LAA-950insp) and less than -910 HU at expiration (%LAA-910exp) obtained with single univariate and multivariate models was compared with that obtained with a multiple model estimation approach in 132 patients with COPD.At univariate analysis, %LAA-950insp and %LAA-910exp values higher than the mean value of this cohort (19.1% and 22.0%) showed better correlation with percentage of predicted diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide (Dlco%) than with airflow obstruction (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1]/vital capacity [VC]). Conversely, %LAA-950insp and %LAA-910exp values lower than the mean value were correlated with FEV1/VC but not with Dlco%. Multiple model estimation performed with two multivariate regressions, each selecting the most appropriate functional variables (FEV1/VC for mild parenchymal destruction, Dlco% and functional residual capacity for severe parenchymal destruction), predicted better than single multivariate regression both %LAA-950insp (R(2) = 0.75 vs 0.46) and %LAA-910exp (R(2) = 0.83 vs 0.63).The relationship between pulmonary function data and CT densitometric changes in COPD varies with the level of lung attenuation impairment. The nonlinear profile of this relationship is accurately predicted with a multiple model estimation approach.", "To examine recall rates from screening mammography and the mammographic findings that caused recall in women who underwent digital breast tomosynthesis with conventional mammography (referred to as two-dimensional [ 2D two-dimensional ] with three-dimensional [ 3D three-dimensional ] imaging [ 2D two-dimensional + 3D three-dimensional ]) and in women who underwent conventional mammography alone (referred to as 2D two-dimensional ).This was an institutional review board-approved, HIPAA-compliant study with waivers of informed consent. A retrospective review of 2D two-dimensional + 3D three-dimensional and 2D two-dimensional screening mammograms from August 1, 2011, to December 31, 2012, was performed. Recall rates and abnormalities that caused recall were compared by controlling for differences in patient age, breast density, and risk factors. Cancer detection rate was assessed from this time period and from 1 year before the introduction of tomosynthesis for a historic control.This study included 17 955 screening mammograms; of the total, there were 8591 (47.8%) 2D two-dimensional + 3D three-dimensional screening examinations and 9364 (52.2%) 2D two-dimensional examinations. The recall rate was 7.8% (671 of 8592) for 2D two-dimensional + 3D three-dimensional and 12.3% (1154 of 9364) for 2D two-dimensional (P < .0001); the rate of recall was 36.6% lower in the 2D two-dimensional + 3D three-dimensional group than in the 2D two-dimensional group. Recall rates for the 2D two-dimensional + 3D three-dimensional group were significantly lower for patients with asymmetries, ( 2D two-dimensional + 3D three-dimensional vs 2D two-dimensional , 3.1% [267 of 8591] vs 7.4% [689 of 9364], respectively; P < .0001) and calcifications ( 2D two-dimensional + 3D three-dimensional vs 2D two-dimensional , 2.4% [205 of 8591] vs 3.2% [297 of 9364], respectively; P = .0014). For patients with masses and architectural distortion, the difference in recall rates was not significant (masses: 2D two-dimensional + 3D three-dimensional vs 2D two-dimensional , 2.5% [215 of 8591] vs 2.5% [237 of 9364], respectively; P = .90; architectural distortion: 2D two-dimensional + 3D three-dimensional vs 2D two-dimensional , 0.68% [58 of 8591] vs 0.69% [65 of 9364]; P = .88). Cancer detection was highest in the 2D two-dimensional + 3D three-dimensional group at 5.9 cancers per 1000 examinations, with 5.7 cancers per 1000 examinations in the concurrent 2D two-dimensional group, and 4.4 cancers per 1000 examinations in the historic control.Use of tomosynthesis ( 2D two-dimensional + 3D three-dimensional ) compared with conventional mammography ( 2D two-dimensional ) is associated with a lower recall rate of screening mammography, most often for asymmetries.", "Purpose To evaluate the effect and clinical importance of sunitinib on pancreatic volume in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). Materials and Methods This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board and compliant with HIPAA. The requirement to obtain informed consent was waived. The authors evaluated 65 patients with GIST treated with oral sunitinib and a control group of 30 patients with GIST who did not receive any therapy (mean age: 56 years [range, 29\u201375 years] vs 60 years [range, 27\u201378 years], respectively; P = .11) seen at their institution from January 2002 through December 2008. Segmented pancreatic volumes of study and control groups were measured with computed tomography by using commercial software by two independent readers who were blinded to study group and the timing of the scan at a median of 6.2 and 6.1 months, respectively. Pre- and posttreatment volumes (Wilcoxon signed rank test) and rate of volume change per month (Wilcoxon rank sum test) were compared. Interobserver agreement was calculated. Associations and prognostic importance of pancreatic atrophy were studied by using multivariate linear regression and Cox proportional analysis, respectively. Results Both readers recorded significant pancreatic volume loss in the study group (respective median pre- and posttreatment volume: 76.1 cm3 and 58.4 cm3 for reader 1 and 67.7 cm3 and 59.0 cm3 for reader 2; P < .0001 for both) but not in the control group (respective median pre- and posttreatment volume: 79.9 cm3 and 83.8 cm3 for reader 1 [P = .43] and 79.9 cm3 and 84.8 cm3 for reader 2 [P = .50]). The rate of volume loss per month was greater in the study group than in the control group (reader 1: \u22122.1% vs \u22120.1%, respectively, P = .003; reader 2: \u22122.0% vs \u22120.3%, P < .0001). Twenty-three of the 65 patients who received sunitinib (35%) showed at least 3% pancreatic volume loss per month, compared with only one of the 30 patients in the control group (3%). The concordance correlation coefficient for pre- and posttreatment measurements was 0.83 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.75, 0.89) and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.94), respectively, and the mean relative difference was 0.04% and 1.2%. Sunitinib treatment was independently associated with pancreatic atrophy (P = .03; risk estimate: 2.64; 95% CI: 0.17, 5.11). At Cox proportional analysis within the study group, more than 3%, more than 5%, and more than 7% loss per month were independently associated with worse survival (P < .001, hazard ratio: >1.00 for all). Conclusion Pancreatic atrophy is a sunitinib-associated toxicity detected at imaging. It may be a clinically important biomarker because a higher rate of pancreatic atrophy was independently associated with shorter survival. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016", "Purpose To develop a practical thyroid imaging reporting and data system (TIRADS) with which to categorize thyroid nodules and stratify their malignant risk. Materials and Methods The institutional review board approved this retrospective study, and the requirement to obtain informed consent for the review of images and records was waived. From May to December 2008, ultrasonographically (US)-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) was performed in 3674 focal thyroid nodules in 3414 consecutive patients. The study included the 1658 thyroid nodules (\u22651 cm in maximum diameter at US) in 1638 patients (1373 women, 265 men) for which pathologic diagnosis or follow-up findings were available. Univariate and multivariate analyses with generalized estimating equations were performed to investigate the relationship between suspicious US features and thyroid cancer. A score for each significant factor was assigned and multiplied by the \u03b2 coefficient obtained for each significant factor from multivariate logistic regression analysis. Scores for each significant factor were then added, resulting in an equation that fitted the probability of malignancy in thyroid nodules. The authors evaluated the fitted probability by using a regression equation; the risk of malignancy was determined according to the number of suspicious US features. Results The following US features showed a significant association with malignancy: solid component, hypoechogenicity, marked hypoechogenicity, microlobulated or irregular margins, microcalcifications, and taller-than-wide shape. As the number of suspicious US features increased, the fitted probability and risk of malignancy also increased. Positive predictive values according to the number of suspicious US features were significantly different (P < .001). Conclusion Risk stratification of thyroid malignancy by using the number of suspicious US features allows for a practical and convenient TIRADS. \u00a9 RSNA, 2011", "Purpose To investigate parameters based on fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging that are best correlated with pathologic complete response (PCR) in human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)\u2013positive cancer and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and with partial or complete response in ER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer. Materials and Methods This study was approved by institutional review board with waivers of informed written consent and included consecutive patients treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Five PET examination\u2013derived parameters were tested: standard uptake value (SUV) maximum (SUVmax), peak (SUVpeak), and mean (SUVmean), metabolically active tumor volume, and total lesion glycolysis (TLG). Absolute values at baseline PET, at PET imaging after two cycles of chemotherapy, and variation (ie, change) were measured. Correlations with pathologic response (Wilcoxon rank-sum test) and predictive power assessed (area under the curve [AUC] on the basis of receiver operating characteristic analysis) were examined. Results Included were 169 consecutive patients (mean age, 50 years). PCR was more frequent in HER2-positive tumors (16 of 33 patients [48.5%]) and TNBCs (20 of 54 patients [37%]) than in ER positive/HER2-negative tumors (four of 82 [4.9%]) (P < .001). Among patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative cancers, 33 patients had partial response. In TNBC, best association with PCR was obtained with change in SUVmax (AUC, 0.86) or change in TLG (AUC, 0.88). In HER2-positive phenotype, absolute SUVmax (or SUVpeak) values at PET imaging after two cycles of chemotherapy (AUC for each cycle, 0.93) were better correlated with PCR than change in SUVmax (AUC, 0.78; P = .11) or change in TLG (AUC, 0.62; P = .005). Regarding ER-positive/HER2-negative cancers, change in SUVmax or change in TLG (AUC, 0.75) were parameters best correlated with partial or complete response. Baseline SUVmax was higher in lymph nodes than in primary tumor in 31 patients. Findings were similar considering the site with highest FDG uptake. Conclusion Quantitative indexes of tumor glucose use that are best correlated with pathologic response vary by phenotype: change in SUVmax or TLG are most adequate for TNBCs and ER-positive/ HER2-negative cancers and absolute SUVmax after two cycles of chemotherapy for HER2-positive breast cancers. \u00a9 RSNA, 2015", "Purpose To compare the capability to aid prediction of clinical outcome measures, including progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), between volumetric estimates from contrast material\u2013enhanced (CE) T1-weighted subtraction maps and traditional segmentation in a randomized multicenter clinical trial of recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) patients treated with bevacizumab. Materials and Methods All patients participating in this study signed institutional review board\u2013approved informed consent at their respective institutions prior to enrolling in the multicenter clinical trial. One-hundred sixty patients with recurrent GBM enrolled as part of a HIPAA-compliant, multicenter clinical trial (AVF3708 g, BRAIN trial). Contrast-enhancing tumor volumes and change in volumes as a response to therapy were quantified by using either conventional segmentation or CE T1-weighted subtraction maps created by voxel-by-voxel subtraction of intensity-normalized nonenhanced T1-weighted images from CE T1-weighted images. These volumes were then tested as predictors of PFS and OS by using log-rank univariate analysis, the multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model, and receiver operating characteristic analysis. Results Use of CE T1-weighted subtraction maps qualitatively improved visualization and improved quantification of tumor volume after bevacizumab treatment. Significant trends between the volume of tumor and change in tumor volume after therapy on CE T1-weighted subtraction maps were found for both PFS and OS (pretreatment volume < 15 cm3, P < .003; posttreatment volume < 7.5 cm3, P < .05; percentage change in volume > 25%, P = .004 for PFS and P = .053 for OS). CE T1-weighted subtraction maps were significantly better at aiding prediction of 6-month PFS and 12-month OS compared with conventional segmentation by using receiver operating characteristic analysis (P < .05). Conclusion Use of CE T1-weighted subtraction maps improved visualization and aided better prediction of patient survival in recurrent GBM treated with bevacizumab compared with conventional segmentation of CE T1-weighted images. \u00a9RSNA, 2013 Clinical trial registration no. NCT00345163 Online supplemental material is available for this article.", "Purpose To evaluate the influence of bridging local-regional therapy (LRT) on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence and overall survival after orthotopic liver transplantation and to identify factors that predict HCC recurrence after orthotopic liver transplantation. Materials and Methods The United Network for Organ Sharing database was used to identify patients with HCC who underwent liver transplantation between 2002 and 2013. Patients with complete explant data within the Milan criteria for whom a Model for End-Stage Liver Disease exception was approved were retrospectively analyzed. Kaplan-Meier estimation was used for survival analysis with log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard models to assess independent prognostic factors for overall survival. Propensity-matched analysis for treatment groups was performed to minimize selection bias. Results The rate of tumor recurrence after liver transplantation was 11.5% (321 of 2794), which significantly decreased overall survival (P < .001). The bridging LRT group exhibited lower recurrence (59 of 686 [8.6%]; P = .02) and longer median overall survival (75.9 months; P < .001). Recurrence was higher in patients older than 60 years, serum \u03b11-fetoprotein greater than 400 mg/L, bilobar distribution, multiple lesions, absent necrosis, microvascular invasion, and tumors beyond the Milan criteria (P < .05). Age, LRT status, serum \u03b11-fetoprotein, and microvascular invasion were independent risk factors (P < .05). In the matched cohort, similar factors that predicted recurrence were observed (P < .05), whereas bridging LRT (P = .03) and serum \u03b11-fetoprotein (P = .02) were independent risk factors for recurrence. Conclusion LRT significantly decreased tumor recurrence and lengthened overall survival. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016.", "Purpose To determine if computed tomographic (CT) texture and histogram analysis measurements of the primary mass are independently associated with overall survival in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who were previously treated with cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and docetaxel (TPF) induction chemotherapy. Materials and Methods This institutional review board\u2013approved retrospective study included 72 patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who were treated with induction TPF chemotherapy in 2004\u20132010. CT texture and histogram analysis of the primary mass on the pretherapy CT images were performed by using TexRAD software before and after application of spatial filters at different anatomic scales ranging from fine detail to coarse features. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the association between overall survival and the baseline CT imaging measurements and clinical variables. Results Primary mass entropy and skewness measurements with multiple spatial filters were associated with overall survival. Multivariate Cox regression analysis incorporating clinical and imaging variables indicated that primary mass size (hazard ratio [HR], 1.58 for each 1-cm increase; P = .018), N stage (HR, 8.77 for N3 vs N0 or N1; P = .002; HR, 4.99 for N3 vs N2; P = .001), and primary mass entropy (HR, 2.10 for each 0.5-unit increase; P = .036) and skewness (HR, 3.67 for each 1.0-unit increase; P = .009) measurements with the 1.0 spatial filter were independently associated with overall survival. Conclusion Independent of tumor size, N stage, and other clinical variables, primary mass CT texture and histogram analysis parameters are associated with overall survival in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who were treated with induction TPF. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Online supplemental material is available for this article.", "To evaluate the feasibility and safety of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-guided laser-based thermotherapy in men with clinically low-risk prostate cancer and a concordant lesion at biopsy and MR imaging.This HIPAA-compliant phase I prospective study was approved by the institutional review board. Informed consent was obtained from all patients. Transperineal MR imaging-guided focal laser ablation for clinically low-risk prostate cancer was performed in patients with a Gleason score of 7 or less in three or fewer cores limited to one sextant obtained with transrectal ultrasonography (US)-guided biopsy and a concordant lesion at MR imaging. Lesions were targeted with a laser ablation system. Periprocedural complications were recorded. The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and the Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) score were collected before and after the procedure. MR imaging-guided biopsy of the ablation zone was performed 6 months after treatment. The prostate-specific antigen level, IPSS, and SHIM score before and after ablation were compared by using the Wilcoxon signed rank test.Treatment was successfully completed in nine patients (procedure duration, 2.5-4 hours; mean laser ablation duration, 4.3 minutes). Immediate contrast-enhanced posttreatment MR imaging showed a hypovascular defect in eight patients. Self-resolving perineal abrasion and focal paresthesia of the glans penis each occurred in one patient. The mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) IPSS and SHIM score at baseline were 5.8 \u00b1 5.3 and 19.0 \u00b1 8.0, respectively. Average score changes were not significantly different from zero during follow-up (P = .18-.99). MR imaging-guided biopsy of the ablation zone showed no cancer in seven patients (78%) and Gleason grade 6 cancer in two (22%).Transperineal MR imaging-guided focal laser ablation appears to be a feasible and safe focal therapy option for clinically low-risk prostate cancer.", "To prospectively evaluate the diagnostic contribution of mammography with synchrotron radiation in patients with questionable or suspicious breast abnormalities identified at combined digital mammography (DM) and ultrasonography (US).The ethics committee approved this prospective study, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Mammography with synchrotron radiation was performed with a phase-detection technique at a synchrotron radiation laboratory. Forty-nine women who met at least one of the inclusion criteria (palpable mass, focal asymmetry, architectural distortion, or equivocal or suspicious mass at DM; none clarified at US) were enrolled. Forty-seven women (mean age, 57.8 years \u00b1 8.8 [standard deviation]; age range, 43-78 years) completed the study protocol, which involved biopsy or follow-up for 1 year as the reference standard. Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) scores of 1-3 were considered to indicate a negative result, while scores 4-5 were considered to indicate a positive result. The visibility of breast abnormalities and the glandular parenchymal structure at DM and at mammography with synchrotron radiation was compared by using the Wilcoxon signed rank test.In 29 of the 31 patients with a final diagnosis of benign entity, mammography with synchrotron radiation yielded BI-RADS scores of 1-3. In 13 of the remaining 16 patients with a final diagnosis of malignancy, mammography with synchrotron radiation yielded BI-RADS scores of 4-5. Therefore, a sensitivity of 81% (13 of 16 patients) and a specificity of 94% (29 of 31 patients) were achieved with use of the described BI-RADS dichotomization system.These study results suggest that mammography with synchrotron radiation can be used to clarify cases of questionable or suspicious breast abnormalities identified at DM.http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.11100745/-/DC1.", "Purpose To document the imaging findings associated with congenital Zika virus infection as found in the Instituto de Pesquisa in Campina Grande State Paraiba (IPESQ) in northeastern Brazil, where the congenital infection has been particularly severe. Materials and Methods From June 2015 to May 2016, 438 patients were referred to the IPESQ for rash occurring during pregnancy or for suspected fetal central nervous system abnormality. Patients who underwent imaging at IPESQ were included, as well as those with documented Zika virus infection in fluid or tissue (n = 17, confirmed infection cohort) or those with brain findings suspicious for Zika virus infection, with intracranial calcifications (n = 28, presumed infection cohort). Imaging examinations included 12 fetal magnetic resonance (MR) examinations, 42 postnatal brain computed tomographic examinations, and 11 postnatal brain MR examinations. Images were reviewed by four radiologists, with final opinion achieved by means of consensus. Results Brain abnormalities seen in confirmed (n = 17) and presumed (n = 28) congenital Zika virus infections were similar, with ventriculomegaly in 16 of 17 (94%) and 27 of 28 (96%) infections, respectively; abnormalities of the corpus callosum in 16 of 17 (94%) and 22 of 28 (78%) infections, respectively; and cortical migrational abnormalities in 16 of 17 (94%) and 28 of 28 (100%) infections, respectively. Although most fetuses underwent at least one examination that showed head circumference below the 5th percentile, head circumference could be normal in the presence of severe ventriculomegaly (seen in three fetuses). Intracranial calcifications were most commonly seen at the gray matter\u2013white matter junction, in 15 of 17 (88%) and 28 of 28 (100%) confirmed and presumed infections, respectively. The basal ganglia and/or thalamus were also commonly involved with calcifications in 11 of 17 (65%) and 18 of 28 (64%) infections, respectively. The skull frequently had a collapsed appearance with overlapping sutures and redundant skin folds and, occasionally, intracranial herniation of orbital fat and clot in the confluence of sinuses. Conclusion The spectrum of findings associated with congenital Zika virus infection in the IPESQ in northeastern Brazil is illustrated to aid the radiologist in identifying Zika virus infection at imaging. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.", "Purpose To examine whether dexamethasone suppression can reduce fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in false-positive (FP) findings in pulmonary and mediastinal lymph nodes in non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Materials and Methods Institutional ethics review board approved this prospective study with written informed consent. The study population was composed of 17 patients with NSCLC who underwent both baseline and dexamethasone suppression (24 hours after oral administration of 8 mg dexamethasone) FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography and surgery. FDG uptake was evaluated by using a five-point visual scoring system (negative findings, score of 0\u20131; positive findings, score of 2\u20134) and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax). The Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon signed-rank, Kruskal-Wallis, or Spearman rank correlation tests were used as necessary for statistical evaluations. Results In 17 primary lesions, no significant difference was noted in visual score between baseline (mean, 3.4 \u00b1 1.2) and dexamethasone suppression scans (mean, 3.3 \u00b1 1.2; P = .16), although SUVmax was significantly lower on dexamethasone suppression scans (mean, 7.1 \u00b1 5.2) than on baseline scans (mean, 8.6 \u00b1 6.6; P = .005). In eight nodes with true-positive (TP) findings, there were no significant differences in visual score (mean for both, 3.8 \u00b1 0.5) and SUVmax (mean, 5.3 \u00b1 2.3 vs 5.5 \u00b1 2.5, respectively; P = .81) between baseline and dexamethasone suppression scans. In 19 nodes with FP findings at baseline, dexamethasone suppression resulted in significantly lowered visual score (mean, 3.4 \u00b1 0.6 vs 2.4 \u00b1 0.8, respectively; P < .001) and SUVmax (mean, 3.5 \u00b1 0.8 vs 2.7 \u00b1 0.7, respectively; P < .001), and four nodes with FP findings were rated as true-negative findings on dexamethasone suppression scans, which resulted in a significant difference in SUVmax between nodal lesions with TP and FP findings (P = .014). Conclusion Oral dexamethasone has the potential to reduce FDG uptake in pulmonary and mediastinal nodes with FP findings in NSCLC. \u00a9 RSNA, 2015 Online supplemental material is available for this article.", "Purpose To investigate the relationship between magnetic resonance (MR) imaging markers of iron content and disease severity in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) over a 2-year period. Materials and Methods This prospective study was approved by the local ethics committee, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Seventeen patients with MS and 17 control subjects were examined twice, 2 years apart, by using phase imaging and transverse relaxation (R2*) mapping at 4.7 T. Quantitative differences in iron content in deep gray matter between patients and control subjects were evaluated with repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance separately for R2* mapping and phase imaging. Multiple regression analysis was used to evaluate correlations of MR imaging measures, both 2-year\u2013difference and single-time measurements, to baseline disease severity. Results R2* mapping using 2-year\u2013difference measurements had the highest correlation to disease severity (r = 0.905, P < .001) compared with R2* mapping using single-time measurements (r = 0.560, P = .019) and phase imaging by using either single-time (r = 0.539, P = .026) or 2-year\u2013difference (r = 0.644, P = .005) measurements. Significant increases in R2* occur during 2 years in the substantia nigra (P < .001) and globus pallidus (P = .035), which are both predictors of disease in regression analysis, in patients compared with control subjects. There were group differences in the substantia nigra, globus pallidus, pulvinar thalamus, thalamus, and caudate nucleus, compared with control subjects with R2* mapping (P < .05), and group differences in the caudate nucleus and pulvinar thalamus, compared with control subjects with phase imaging (P < .05). Conclusion There are significant changes in deep gray matter iron content in MS during 2 years measured with MR imaging, changes that are strongly related to physical disability. Longitudinal measurements may produce a higher correlation to disease severity compared with single-time measurements because baseline iron content of deep gray matter is variable among subjects. \u00a9RSNA, 2013", "Purpose To evaluate the relationship between prostate cancer aggressiveness and histogram-derived apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) parameters obtained from whole-lesion assessment of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the prostate and to determine which ADC metric may help best differentiate low-grade from intermediate- or high-grade prostate cancer lesions. Materials and Methods The institutional review board approved this retrospective HIPAA-compliant study of 131 men (median age, 60 years) who underwent diffusion-weighted MR imaging before prostatectomy for prostate cancer. Clinically significant tumors (tumor volume > 0.5 mL) were identified at whole-mount step-section histopathologic examination, and Gleason scores of the tumors were recorded. A volume of interest was drawn around each significant tumor on ADC maps. The mean, median, and 10th and 25th percentile ADCs were determined from the whole-lesion histogram and correlated with the Gleason score by using the Spearman correlation coefficient (\u03c1). The ability of each parameter to help differentiate tumors with a Gleason score of 6 from those with a Gleason score of at least 7 was assessed by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (Az). Results In total, 116 clinically significant lesions (89 in the peripheral zone, 27 in the transition zone) were identified in 85 of the 131 patients (65%). Forty-six patients did not have a clinically significant lesion. For mean ADC, median ADC, 10th percentile ADC, and 25th percentile ADC, the Spearman \u03c1 values for correlation with Gleason score were \u22120.31, \u22120.30, \u22120.36, and \u22120.35, respectively, whereas the Az values for differentiating lesions with a Gleason score of 6 from those with a Gleason score of at least 7 were 0.704, 0.692, 0.758, and 0.723, respectively. The Az of 10th percentile ADC was significantly higher than that of the mean ADC for all lesions and peripheral zone lesions (P = .0001). Conclusion When whole-lesion histograms were used to derive ADC parameters, 10th percentile ADC correlated with Gleason score better than did other ADC parameters, suggesting that 10th percentile ADC may prove to be optimal for differentiating low-grade from intermediate- or high-grade prostate cancer with diffusion-weighted MR imaging. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013", "Purpose To estimate the relative yield of therapeutic flexible sigmoidoscopy compared with complete optical colonoscopy for isolated left-sided polyps (\u22656 mm in diameter) identified at screening computed tomographic (CT) colonography. Materials and Methods This retrospective institutional review board\u2013approved and HIPAA-compliant study included a review of CT colonographic screening results in 6570 consecutive asymptomatic adults (3551 women, 3019 men; mean age, 56.8 years \u00b1 7.3 [standard deviation]). Of 887 (13.5%) patients with cases positive for nondiminutive polyps (\u22656 mm), a subset of 171 patients met the inclusion criteria (a) of having left-sided\u2013only lesions of 6 mm or larger identified at CT colonography (rectum-to-splenic flexure) and (b) of undergoing subsequent evaluation with complete optical colonoscopy. CT colonography\u2013optical colonoscopy concordance and proximal-versus-distal diagnostic yield at optical colonoscopy were assessed. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for relevant results. Results From the study group of 171 patients, a total of 234 left-sided lesions of 6 mm or larger were prospectively reported at CT colonography, of which 222 (94.9%; 95% CI: 91.3%, 97.0%) were confirmed as true-positive findings at optical colonoscopy. With optical colonoscopy, an additional 17 benign left-sided polyps of 6 mm or larger (13 small, four large) were found in 11 patients, resulting in a total left-sided yield of 239 nondiminutive lesions, including 137 small polyps (6\u20139 mm) and 102 large lesions (\u226510 mm), 160 neoplasms, 82 advanced adenomas, and seven cancers. Evaluation of the colon proximal to the splenic flexure in this cohort yielded eight small and two large benign polyps in nine patients but no proximal cancers or histologically advanced lesions. Conclusion For patients with left-sided\u2013only polyps detected at CT colonography, the additional yield of complete optical colonoscopy beyond the expected reach of flexible sigmoidoscopy is very low and may not justify the added costs, potential risks, and procedural time. \u00a9 RSNA, 2011", "Purpose To compare positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and PET/computed tomography (CT) for lesion detection and interpretation, quantification of fluorine 18 (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake, and accuracy of MR-based PET attenuation correction in pediatric patients with solid tumors. Materials and Methods This prospective study had local ethics committee and German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices approval. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients and legal guardians. Twenty whole-body 18F-FDG PET/CT and 18F-FDG PET/MR examinations were performed in 18 pediatric patients (median age, 14 years; range, 11\u201317 years). 18F-FDG PET/CT and 18F-FDG PET/MR data were acquired sequentially on the same day for all patients. PET standardized uptake values (SUVs) were quantified with volume of interest measurements in lesions and healthy tissues. MR-based PET attenuation correction was compared with CT-derived attenuation maps (\u00b5-maps). Lesion detection was assessed with separate reading of PET/CT and PET/MR data. Estimates of radiation dose were derived from the applied doses of 18F-FDG and CT protocol parameters. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed to report correlation coefficients and relative deviations for comparison of SUVs, rates of lesion detection, and percentage reductions in radiation dose. Results PET SUVs showed strong correlations between PET of PET/CT (PETCT) and PET of PET/MR (PETMR) (r > 0.85 for most tissues). Apart from drawbacks of MR-based PET attenuation correction in osseous structures and lungs, similar SUVs were found on PET images corrected with CT-based \u00b5-maps (13.1% deviation of SUVs for bone marrow and <5% deviation for other tissues). Lesion detection rate with PET/MR imaging was equivalent to that with PET/CT (61 areas of focal uptake on PETMR images vs 62 areas on PETCT images). Advantages of PET/MR were observed especially in soft-tissue regions. Furthermore, PET/MR offered significant dose reduction (73%) compared with PET/CT. Conclusion Pediatric oncologic PET/MR is technically feasible, showing satisfactory performance for PET quantification with SUVs similar to those of PET/CT. Compared with PET/CT, PET/MR demonstrates equivalent lesion detection rates while offering markedly reduced radiation exposure. Thus, PET/MR is a promising modality for the clinical work-up of pediatric malignancies. \u00a9 RSNA, 2014 Online supplemental material is available for this article.", "To test the in vivo feasibility of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of ischemia reperfusion injury after syngeneic lung transplantation in mice and to characterize tissue relaxation properties by using very short echo-time (TE) sequences at 4.7 T.The experimental protocol was approved by the institutional animal committee. MR imaging was performed in six C57BL/6 mice 24 hours after the animals underwent syngeneic orthotopic left lung transplantation. A small-animal MR imager was equipped with a linear polarized hydrogen birdcage mouse coil. In addition to conventional T1-weighted spoiled gradient-echo and T2-weighted fast spin-echo sequences, three-dimensional very short TE sequences (50-5000 \u03bcsec) were performed. Color-encoded parametric maps of T2* transverse relaxation times were calculated on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Quantitative T2* values of the parenchyma of the transplanted lungs and relative spin density were compared by using region-of-interest analysis with the two-sided paired Student t test. After MR imaging, transplanted lungs were processed for histologic examination.Transplanted ventilated lungs in all the mice showed similar low signal intensity with the conventional T1- and T2-weighted sequences. The very short TE sequence exhibited signal yield in the lungs that was higher than that of the noise level. Increased spin density (50.8% \u00b1 26.9 [standard deviation], P = .006) and longer T2* relaxation time (1041 \u03bcsec \u00b1 424, P = .016) were found in the transplanted lungs. Best visualization was possible using color-encoded log-transformed parametric T2* maps. Conventional T2-weighted sequences revealed small pleural effusions. Histologic examination demonstrated ischemia reperfusion injury with a predominance of either cell influx or edema.Ischemia reperfusion injury after syngeneic lung transplantation can be visualized and characterized using very short TE sequences showing different MR imaging relaxation properties when compared with normal lung parenchyma.", "The growth in medical imaging over the past 2 decades has yielded unarguable benefits to patients in terms of longer lives of higher quality. This growth reflects new technologies and applications, including high-tech services such as multisection computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and positron emission tomography (PET). Some part of the growth, however, can be attributed to the overutilization of imaging services. This report examines the causes of the overutilization of imaging and identifies ways of addressing the causes so that overutilization can be reduced. In August 2009, the American Board of Radiology Foundation hosted a 2-day summit to discuss the causes and effects of the overutilization of imaging. More than 60 organizations were represented at the meeting, including health care accreditation and certification entities, foundations, government agencies, hospital and health systems, insurers, medical societies, health care quality consortia, and standards and regulatory agencies. Key forces influencing overutilization were identified. These include the payment mechanisms and financial incentives in the U.S. health care system; the practice behavior of referring physicians; self-referral, including referral for additional radiologic examinations; defensive medicine; missed educational opportunities when inappropriate procedures are requested; patient expectations; and duplicate imaging studies. Summit participants suggested several areas for improvement to reduce overutilization, including a national collaborative effort to develop evidence-based appropriateness criteria for imaging; greater use of practice guidelines in requesting and conducting imaging studies; decision support at point of care; education of referring physicians, patients, and the public; accreditation of imaging facilities; management of self-referral and defensive medicine; and payment reform.", "To evaluate the utility of hepatocyte-phase gadoxetate disodium-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in staging hepatic fibrosis and to compare it with diffusion-weighted imaging.This retrospective study had institutional review board approval, and the requirement for informed consent was waived. Gadoxetate disodium-enhanced and diffusion-weighted MR images obtained in 114 consecutive patients (70 men, 44 women; age range, 37-91 years) were evaluated. Liver-to-muscle signal intensity (SI) ratio on hepatocyte-phase images (SI(post)), contrast enhancement index calculated as SI(post) /SI(pre), where SI(pre) is liver-to-muscle SI ratio on nonenhanced images, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the liver were measured. Necroinflammatory activity grades and hepatic fibrosis stages were histopathologically determined in 99 patients. Multiple regressions of SI(post), contrast enhancement index, ADC, serum albumin concentration, serum total bilirubin level, prothrombin time, and Child-Pugh score were examined to determine correlation with hepatic necroinflammatory activity grades and fibrosis stages.Among the MR, hematologic, and clinical parameters, contrast enhancement index was most strongly correlated with fibrosis stage (r = -0.79, P < .001). Multiple regression analysis showed that the contrast enhancement index, ADC, and prothrombin time were significantly correlated (r(2) = 0.66, P < .05) with fibrosis stage and that the contrast enhancement index and serum total bilirubin level were weakly correlated (r(2) = 0.24, P < .05) with the necroinflammatory activity grade.Gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MR imaging is more reliable for staging hepatic fibrosis than are diffusion-weighted MR imaging, hematologic, and clinical parameters.", "To examine the factors that affect inter- and intraobserver agreement for pulmonary nodule type classification on low-radiation-dose computed tomographic (CT) images, and their potential effect on patient management.Nodules (n = 160) were randomly selected from the Dutch-Belgian Lung Cancer Screening Trial cohort, with equal numbers of nodule types and similar sizes. Nodules were scored by eight radiologists by using morphologic categories proposed by the Fleischner Society guidelines for management of pulmonary nodules as solid, part solid with a solid component smaller than 5 mm, part solid with a solid component 5 mm or larger, or pure ground glass. Inter- and intraobserver agreement was analyzed by using Cohen \u03ba statistics. Multivariate analysis of variance was performed to assess the effect of nodule characteristics and image quality on observer disagreement. Effect on nodule management was estimated by differentiating CT follow-up for ground-glass nodules, solid nodules 8 mm or smaller, and part-solid nodules smaller than 5 mm from immediate diagnostic work-up for solid nodules larger than 8 mm and part-solid nodules 5 mm or greater.Pair-wise inter- and intraobserver agreement was moderate (mean \u03ba, 0.51 [95% confidence interval, 0.30, 0.68] and 0.57 [95% confidence interval, 0.47, 0.71]). Categorization as part-solid nodules and location in the upper lobe significantly reduced observer agreement (P = .012 and P < .001, respectively). By considering all possible reading pairs (28 possible combinations of observer pairs \u00d7 160 nodules = 4480 possible agreements or disagreements), a discordant nodule classification was found in 36.4% (1630 of 4480), related to presence or size of a solid component in 88.7% (1446 of 1630). Two-thirds of these discrepant readings (1061 of 1630) would have potentially resulted in different nodule management.There is moderate inter- and intraobserver agreement for nodule classification by using current recommendations for low-radiation-dose CT examinations of the chest. Discrepancies in nodule categorization were mainly caused by disagreement on the size and presence of a solid component, which may lead to different management in the majority of cases with such discrepancies.

Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval and written informed consent were obtained. Between June 2008 and September 2011, 345 women (age range, 26\u201381 years; mean age, 51.3 years \u00b1 11.6 [standard deviation]) underwent DCE MR mammography, with T1-weighted three-dimensional MR images (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 8.86/4.51; flip angle, 25\u00b0) acquired with a 1.5-T whole-body MR unit before and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 minutes after a gadobutrol bolus injection of 0.1 mmol per kilogram of body weight. Regions of interest were traced manually, and T1 SI of parenchyma was recorded. The influence of different predictors of T1 baseline SI and contrast enhancement was studied by using random-effects models. Results T1 baseline SI varied considerably between women, with a mean of 167.7 \u00b1 49.2 (71.4\u2013424.7 [range]) and 175.9 \u00b1 48.9 (51.8\u2013458.3) in the right and the left breast, respectively (P < .01). T1 baseline SI increased linearly with age (P < .0001) and body weight (P < .0001). After contrast material delivery, relative percentage of enhancement was 8.1%, 13.8%, 18.2%, 22.1%, and 24.6% at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 minutes, respectively, but varied considerably between women. Contrast enhancement was 9.3% in the lowest quintile and 47.4% in the highest. Contrast enhancement increased with body weight (P < .01) but decreased in postmenopausal women (P < .01). Women with higher baseline T1 SI tended to have a higher contrast enhancement slope. Conclusion Anthropometric measures and menopausal status contribute to a large variability in contrast enhancement of normal breast parenchyma. This might influence the interpretation of contrast enhancement kinetics of breast lesions and current strategies for determining contrast medium dose for breast MR imaging. \u00a9 RSNA, 2012", "To develop a magnetic resonance (MR) \"fingerprinting\" technique for quantitative abdominal imaging.This HIPAA-compliant study had institutional review board approval, and informed consent was obtained from all subjects. To achieve accurate quantification in the presence of marked B0 and B1 field inhomogeneities, the MR fingerprinting framework was extended by using a two-dimensional fast imaging with steady-state free precession, or FISP, acquisition and a Bloch-Siegert B1 mapping method. The accuracy of the proposed technique was validated by using agarose phantoms. Quantitative measurements were performed in eight asymptomatic subjects and in six patients with 20 focal liver lesions. A two-tailed Student t test was used to compare the T1 and T2 results in metastatic adenocarcinoma with those in surrounding liver parenchyma and healthy subjects.Phantom experiments showed good agreement with standard methods in T1 and T2 after B1 correction. In vivo studies demonstrated that quantitative T1, T2, and B1 maps can be acquired within a breath hold of approximately 19 seconds. T1 and T2 measurements were compatible with those in the literature. Representative values included the following: liver, 745 msec \u00b1 65 (standard deviation) and 31 msec \u00b1 6; renal medulla, 1702 msec \u00b1 205 and 60 msec \u00b1 21; renal cortex, 1314 msec \u00b1 77 and 47 msec \u00b1 10; spleen, 1232 msec \u00b1 92 and 60 msec \u00b1 19; skeletal muscle, 1100 msec \u00b1 59 and 44 msec \u00b1 9; and fat, 253 msec \u00b1 42 and 77 msec \u00b1 16, respectively. T1 and T2 in metastatic adenocarcinoma were 1673 msec \u00b1 331 and 43 msec \u00b1 13, respectively, significantly different from surrounding liver parenchyma relaxation times of 840 msec \u00b1 113 and 28 msec \u00b1 3 (P < .0001 and P < .01) and those in hepatic parenchyma in healthy volunteers (745 msec \u00b1 65 and 31 msec \u00b1 6, P < .0001 and P = .021, respectively).A rapid technique for quantitative abdominal imaging was developed that allows simultaneous quantification of multiple tissue properties within one 19-second breath hold, with measurements comparable to those in published literature.", "To compare accuracy, precision, and reproducibility of four commonly used myocardial T1 mapping sequences: modified Look-Locker inversion recovery (MOLLI), shortened MOLLI (ShMOLLI), saturation recovery single-shot acquisition (SASHA), and saturation pulse prepared heart rate independent inversion recovery (SAPPHIRE).This HIPAA-compliant study was approved by the institutional review board. All subjects provided written informed consent. Accuracy, precision, and reproducibility of the four T1 mapping sequences were first compared in phantom experiments. In vivo analysis was performed in seven healthy subjects (mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 38 years \u00b1 19; four men, three women) who were imaged twice on two separate days. In vivo reproducibility of native T1 mapping and extracellular volume (ECV) were measured. Differences between the sequences were assessed by using Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon rank sum tests (phantom data) and mixed-effect models (in vivo data).T1 mapping accuracy in phantoms was lower with ShMOLLI (62 msec) and MOLLI (44 msec) than with SASHA (13 msec; P < .05) and SAPPHIRE (12 msec; P < .05). MOLLI had similar precision to ShMOLLI (4.0 msec vs 5.6 msec; P = .07) but higher precision than SAPPHIRE (6.8 msec; P = .002) and SASHA (8.7 msec; P < .001). All sequences had similar reproducibility in phantoms (P = .1). The four sequences had similar in vivo reproducibility for native T1 mapping (\u223c25-50 msec; P > .05) and ECV quantification (\u223c0.01-0.02; P > .05).SASHA and SAPPHIRE yield higher accuracy, lower precision, and similar reproducibility compared with MOLLI and ShMOLLI for T1 measurement. Different sequences yield different ECV values; however, all sequences have similar reproducibility for ECV quantification.", "To determine the effect of baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) on the causal association between intravenous iodinated contrast material exposure and subsequent development of acute kidney injury (AKI) in propensity score-matched groups of patients who underwent contrast material-enhanced or unenhanced computed tomography (CT).This retrospective study was HIPAA compliant and institutional review board approved. All patients who underwent contrast-enhanced (contrast material group) or unenhanced (non-contrast material group) CT between 2000 and 2010 were identified and stratified according to baseline eGFR by using Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative cutoffs for chronic kidney disease into subgroups with eGFR of 90 or greater, 60-89, 30-59, and less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Propensity score generation and 1:1 matching of patients were performed in each eGFR subgroup. Incidence of AKI (serum creatinine [SCr] increase of \u22650.5 mg/dL [\u226544.2 \u03bcmol/L] above baseline) was compared in the matched subgroups by using the Fisher exact test.A total of 12 508 propensity score-matched patients with contrast-enhanced and unenhanced scans met all inclusion criteria. In this predominantly inpatient cohort, the incidence of AKI significantly increased with decreasing baseline eGFR (P < .0001). However, this incidence was not significantly different between contrast material and non-contrast material groups in any eGFR subgroup; for the subgroup with eGFR of 90 or greater (n = 1642), odds ratio (OR) was 0.91 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.38, 2.15), P = .82; for the subgroup with eGFR of 60-89 (n = 3870), OR was 1.03 (95% CI: 0.66, 1.60), P = .99; for the subgroup with eGFR of 30-59 (n = 5510), OR was 0.94 (95% CI: 0.76, 1.18), P = .65; and for the subgroup with eGFR of less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (n = 1486), OR was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.72, 1.30), P = .89.Diminished eGFR is associated with an increased risk of SCr-defined AKI following CT examinations. However, the risk of AKI is independent of contrast material exposure, even in patients with eGFR of less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2).", "To investigate the feasibility of magnetic resonance (MR) electric impedance tomography ( EIT electric impedance tomography ) technique for in situ monitoring of electric field distribution during in vivo electroporation of mouse tumors to predict reversibly electroporated tumor areas.All experiments received institutional animal care and use committee approval. Group 1 consisted of eight tumors that were used for determination of predicted area of reversibly electroporated tumor cells with MR EIT electric impedance tomography by using a 2.35-T MR imager. In addition, T1-weighted images of tumors were acquired to determine entrapment of contrast agent within the reversibly electroporated area. A correlation between predicted reversible electroporated tumor areas as determined with MR EIT electric impedance tomography and areas of entrapped MR contrast agent was evaluated to verify the accuracy of the prediction. Group 2 consisted of seven tumors that were used for validation of radiologic imaging with histopathologic staining. Histologic analysis results were then compared with predicted reversible electroporated tumor areas from group 1. Results were analyzed with Pearson correlation analysis and one-way analysis of variance.Mean coverage \u00b1 standard deviation of tumors with electric field that leads to reversible electroporation of tumor cells obtained with MR EIT electric impedance tomography (38% \u00b1 9) and mean fraction of tumors with entrapped MR contrast agent (41% \u00b1 13) were correlated (Pearson analysis, r = 0.956, P = .005) and were not statistically different (analysis of variance, P = .11) from mean fraction of tumors from group 2 with entrapped fluorescent dye (39% \u00b1 12).MR EIT electric impedance tomography can be used for determining electric field distribution in situ during electroporation of tissue. Implementation of MR EIT electric impedance tomography in electroporation-based applications, such as electrochemotherapy and irreversible electroporation tissue ablation, would enable corrective interventions before the end of the procedure and would additionally improve the treatment outcome.", "Purpose To compare the classification of breast density with two automated methods, Volpara (version 1.5.0; Matakina Technology, Wellington, New Zealand) and Quantra (version 2.0; Hologic, Bedford, Mass), with clinical Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) density classifications and to examine associations of these measures with breast cancer risk. Materials and Methods In this study, 1911 patients with breast cancer and 4170 control subjects matched for age, race, examination date, and mammography machine were evaluated. Participants underwent mammography at Mayo Clinic or one of four sites within the San Francisco Mammography Registry between 2006 and 2012 and provided informed consent or a waiver for research, in compliance with HIPAA regulations and institutional review board approval. Digital mammograms were retrieved a mean of 2.1 years (range, 6 months to 6 years) before cancer diagnosis, with the corresponding clinical BI-RADS density classifications, and Volpara and Quantra density estimates were generated. Agreement was assessed with weighted \u03ba statistics among control subjects. Breast cancer associations were evaluated with conditional logistic regression, adjusted for age and body mass index. Odds ratios, C statistics, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. Results Agreement between clinical BI-RADS density classifications and Volpara and Quantra BI-RADS estimates was moderate, with \u03ba values of 0.57 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.59) and 0.46 (95% CI: 0.44, 0.47), respectively. Differences of up to 14% in dense tissue classification were found, with Volpara classifying 51% of women as having dense breasts, Quantra classifying 37%, and clinical BI-RADS assessment used to classify 43%. Clinical and automated measures showed similar breast cancer associations; odds ratios for extremely dense breasts versus scattered fibroglandular densities were 1.8 (95% CI: 1.5, 2.2), 1.9 (95% CI: 1.5, 2.5), and 2.3 (95% CI: 1.9, 2.8) for Volpara, Quantra, and BI-RADS classifications, respectively. Clinical BI-RADS assessment showed better discrimination of case status (C = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.58, 0.61) than did Volpara (C = 0.58; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.59) and Quantra (C = 0.56; 95% CI: 0.54, 0.58) BI-RADS classifications. Conclusion Automated and clinical assessments of breast density are similarly associated with breast cancer risk but differ up to 14% in the classification of women with dense breasts. This could have substantial effects on clinical practice patterns.

Five radiologists graded the severity of fatty liver by using a seven-point scale for four imaging sets created from 179 pairs of dual-echo in- and opposed-phase magnetic resonance images from 179 patients. The four sets contained images displayed in parallel, subtraction images, color-encoded subtraction images, and images from the three previous formats presented together. The order of the images and sets was randomized. Sensitivity and specificity were assessed with the McNemar test. Accuracy was assessed by using three-way analysis of variance, with Tukey post hoc methods used to assess differences between the four formats. Interobserver reliability was assessed by using the Fleiss \u03ba value.Subtraction (P = .016 at a 5% SI difference threshold) and color-encoded subtraction (P = .031 at a 4% SI difference threshold) formats had higher sensitivity than did the parallel format. The accuracy of the subtraction format was superior to that of the parallel format (P < .0001). Interobserver reliability of the subtraction (\u03ba = 0.53) and color-encoded subtraction (\u03ba = 0.39) formats was superior to that of the parallel format (\u03ba = 0.33) (P < .0001 and P = .0085, respectively).When images are well registered, subtraction and color-encoded subtraction techniques offer advantages over the traditional parallel presentation format for the assessment of SI differences.", "Purpose To develop and test human kinase insert domain receptor (KDR)-targeted microbubbles (MBs) (MBKDR) for imaging KDR at the molecular level and for monitoring antiangiogenic therapy in a human colon cancer xenograft tumor model in mice. Materials and Methods Animal studies were approved by the Institutional Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care. A heterodimeric peptide that binds to human KDR with low nanomolar affinity (KD = 0.5 nmol/L) was coupled onto the surface of perfluorobutane-containing lipid-shelled MBs (MBKDR). Binding specificity of MBKDR to human KDR and cross-reactivity with murine vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2 (VEGFR2) were tested in cell culture under flow shear stress conditions (at 100 sec\u22121). In vivo binding specificity of MBKDR to VEGFR2 was tested in human LS174T colon cancer xenografts in mice with a 40-MHz ultrasonographic (US) transducer. Targeted contrast material\u2013enhanced US imaging signal by using MBKDR was longitudinally measured during 6 days in tumors with (n = 6) and without (n = 6) antiangiogenic treatment (anti-VEGF antibody). Ex vivo VEGFR2 staining and microvessel density analysis were performed. Significant differences were evaluated (t, Mann-Whitney, or Wilcoxon test). Results Cell culture experiments showed four times greater binding specificity of MBKDR to human KDR and cross-reactivity to murine VEGFR2 (P \u2264 .01). In vivo imaging signal was more than three times higher (P = .01) with MBKDR compared with control MBs and decreased significantly (approximately fourfold lower, P = .03) following in vivo receptor blocking with anti-VEGFR2 antibody. One day after initiation of antiangiogenic therapy, imaging signal was significantly decreased (approximately 46% lower, P = .02) in treated versus untreated tumors; it remained significantly lower (range, 46%\u201384% decreased; P = .038) during the following 5 days. Microvessel density was significantly reduced (P = .04) in treated (mean, 7.3 microvessels per square millimeter \u00b1 4.7 [standard deviation]) versus untreated tumors (mean, 22.0 microvessels per square millimeter \u00b1 9.4); VEGFR2 expression was significantly decreased (>50% lower, P = .03) in treated tumors. Conclusion Human MBKDR allow in vivo imaging and longitudinal monitoring of VEGFR2 expression in human colon cancer xenografts. \u00a9 RSNA, 2010 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.10091858/-/DC1", "To investigate factors influencing the quality of ultrasonographic (US) elastography in the evaluation of suspicious breast masses.This prospective study was conducted with institutional review board approval; written informed consent was obtained. Between January 2009 and February 2009, real-time US elastography of 312 breast masses (245 benign, 67 malignant) was performed in 268 consecutive patients (mean age, 45.7 years \u00b1 10.2 [standard deviation]) prior to US-guided core biopsy. Five breast radiologists who had performed the examinations assessed the quality of elasticity images as inadequate, low, or high without histologic information. Age, body mass index (BMI), mammographic density, lesion size, lesion depth, and breast thickness at US were analyzed for their association with image quality by using the \u03c7(2) test, Student t test, and multivariate analysis. Sensitivities and specificities for the differentiation of benign from malignant masses on the basis of elastography were calculated and compared between groups of quality scores by using the logistic regression method.The quality of elasticity images was assessed as inadequate in 21 (6.7%) cases, low in 134 (42.9%), and high in 157 (50.3%). According to univariate analysis, smaller lesion size (P = .001), shallower lesion depth (P = .005), less breast thickness where the lesion was located (P < .0001), and benign pathologic finding (P = .004) were significantly associated with higher image quality. There was no correlation of image quality with age (P = .213), BMI (P = .191), mammographic density (P = .091), or distance from the nipple (P = .100). Multivariable analysis showed that breast thickness at the location of target lesions was the most important factor influencing elasticity image quality (P = .001). There were significant differences in sensitivity between higher-quality and lower-quality images (87.0% vs 56.8%, respectively; P = .015) in the differentiation of benign from malignant masses.Breast thickness at the location of the lesion was the most important factor influencing image quality at US elastography. Sensitivity for classification of benign and malignant masses improved with higher quality scores."], "label": ["unimpactful", "unimpactful", "unimpactful", "impactful", "unimpactful", "unimpactful", "impactful", "unimpactful", "impactful", "impactful", "impactful", "impactful", "impactful", "unimpactful", "unimpactful", "impactful", "unimpactful", "unimpactful", "unimpactful", "impactful", "unimpactful", "impactful", "unimpactful", "impactful", "impactful", "impactful", "unimpactful", "unimpactful", "impactful", "impactful", "impactful", "unimpactful", "unimpactful", "impactful", "unimpactful", "impactful", "unimpactful", "impactful", "impactful", "impactful", "unimpactful", "impactful", "impactful", "impactful", "impactful", "impactful", "unimpactful", "impactful", "impactful"]}
