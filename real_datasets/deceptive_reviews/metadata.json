        "**Spatial Configuration**: **Truthful opinions** emphasize **spatial configurations** (e.g., *small, bathroom, on, location*), while **deceptive opinions** focus on **aspects external to the subject being reviewed** (e.g., *husband, business, vacation*). This may be because liars have difficulty encoding spatial information.",
        "**Emotion Terms**: **Deceptive reviews** tend to have **more positive and fewer negative emotion terms**.",
        "**First-Person Pronouns**: Increased usage of **first person singular pronouns** in reviews may indicate deception. Deceivers may be attempting to enhance the credibility of their reviews by emphasizing their own presence in the review.",
        "**Parts of Speech**: **Truthful writings** typically consist of **more nouns, adjectives, prepositions, determiners, and coordinating conjunctions**, while **imaginative (deceptive) writing** consists of **more verbs, adverbs, pronouns, and pre-determiners**.",
        "**Information Density**: **Deceptive language contains less information**. The contents of deceptive language may contain **fewer adjectives, prepositions, and comparative words**.",
        "**Affective Cues**: **Increased affective cues** are related to deceptive language. Fraudulent reviewers are more likely to use **positive and negative emotional expressions** than people who post truthful reviews, and may also use **positive or negative affective words** more in deceptive reviews to mislead consumers.",
        "**Detail Cues**: A **lack of detail cues** is indicative of deceptive reviews, particularly when the motive is a **perfunctory response**. The sentence structure and textual content of reviews with **perfunctory responses** is simple and less informative, leading to **a lack of detail**.",
        "**Cognitive Cues**: **More cognitive cues** are present in deceptive reviews by paid posters compared to authentic reviews.",
        "**Perceptual Cues**: All **deceptive online reviews** tend to **lack perceptual cues in their contents**."
