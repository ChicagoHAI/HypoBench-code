{"story": ["Alone in a field miles outside of the nearest town I sat, leaning up against a tree staring off into the night sky. It was not a cold night like I was used to. The warm Californian air felt ever so relaxing on my tired body. Nothing was going through my mind, no thoughts, no concerns. Complete serenity.\n\nOccasionally an airplane would fly overhead, red and green lights gently pulsing as they silently sliced across the endless expanse of darkness. The moon was nowhere to be seen tonight, so the stars seemed to shine brighter than I'd ever seen them before. I could see all the constellations I knew: the big dipper and... the little dipper. I don't know anything about stars, I just like looking at them. After a few hours of sitting there, occasionally jotting down ideas into my journal, I became fixed on one particular star in the sky.\n\nThis star was different. It would blink, but not in the same soft twinkling the other stars would. It did not move slowly across the sky like a satellite, instead this star was completely stationary, like any other star. On a hunch, I wrote down the blinking pattern it seemed to create. At first it looked like gibberish, since it went on for several pages of my journal without repeating, but sure enough, it started over again.\n\nNow, I do not understand morse code beyond the notion of the dots and dashes so I had to seek help online with translating it. I posted scans of the journal pages online, asking for help. Everybody wanted to know where the codes came from. I told them, but nobody believed me. One of the people on the forum where I posted it actually went as far as retracing my steps and sat out there at the same spot on the next new moon to try and see the star I mentioned. Unsurprisingly, he didn't see anything the whole night.\n\nBecause of the nature of the pattern, it became clear that one perfect translation would be near impossible to find. People posted everything from \"Dogs house bank Lichtenstein NORAD\" to \"Cafe noon thursday twelve thirty-seven bread eighteen street\" as partial solutions, but everybody agreed on one thing: none of these made any sense at all.\n\nTwo months after I posted it, I received a message. Not on the forum I posted it to, but rather an anonymous text message from a blocked number.\n\n\"You have something we want. We have something you want. Yes, this is about the code.\"\n\nConfused, I pressed for more information but the only reply I got was one from the phone company saying the number had been disconnected. This was getting eerie. It wasn't until the next day that another text came, this time from a different blocked number.\n\n\"Meet at the big tree in the field next full moon. All is revealed.\"\n\nChilling. What were they on about? Why all the secrecy? Maybe the guy that retraced my steps snapped. I tried posting in the original thread where I posted the scanned pages, but it was met with a 404. Someone had deleted the thread. Now I knew I had to meet up with this mystery man.\n\nThe night of the full moon I was getting pretty nervous, I mean, what if it's a serial killer trying to get a good shot at me? But on the other hand the opportunity to finally figure out the puzzle was just too tempting. I drove out to the same spot I had laid months before, and to my surprise, there was no other vehicle there. No car, no van, no bike, no person or anything that I could see. I grabbed my flashlight and stepped out of the car, headed to the tree.\n\nThe grass had been worn down over time, forming a trail to the tree from the dirt road where I parked, even though it was only a few dozen yards away. Foot traffic must have skyrocketed since I first posted. Halfway to the tree I heard a branch snap off to my right. I spun around and shined my flashlight at the trees in the distance. It was only a deer, as scared as I was. I sighed a breath of relief before continuing to the tree.\n\nI had just sat down where I heard someone call my name.\n\n\"James Alva McGee.\"\n\nI swear my heart must have stopped for a good five seconds.\n\n\"Do not get up. No sudden movements. Just keep watching the sky.\" The voice continued.\n\n\"Who are you?\" Was all I could say.\n\n\"Who I am is not important. What is important is that you must tell me the true origin of the code. It is absolutely imperative that you comply, lest we resort to less civil measures.\"\n\n\"Wh-what? I swear I told the truth! There was something blinking in the sky! All I did was observe it!\"\n\nThe mysterious character still had not shown himself.\n\n\"Normally we would catch up to you immediately afterward and warn you to not tell a soul about what you saw here, but it is much too late for that. The board may have been expunged, but you can not undue people's memory of your post. From our close monitoring we've determined that you truly are clueless. Although I am not fond of this idea, my superiors have decided to let you go, so long as you hand over any and all evidence you have of your encounter.\"\n\n\"How do you expect me to do that? You're still talking to me from nowhere!\"\n\nI heard footsteps behind me as the man emerged from the darkness. No wonder I couldn't see him, he was dressed in an all-black suit and despite it being the dead of night, he was wearing sunglasses. I know these guys. We've all heard about them. I thought they were just a myth, the real men in black.\n\n\"The safety of your country depends on those pitiful scraps of paper you have in your journal. Hand it over, along with your cell phone.\"\n\n\"My country? Are-are you FBI? CIA? NSA? Am I going to be 'disappeared'?\" I stammered, as I frantically searched through my backpack trying to remove the journal.\n\nI handed over the journal and my phone to the man. He promptly opened the journal, tore out the pages with the code on them, and all of the pages after them that bore the imprint from the pen I used to write it, and stuffed the pages into his jacket pocket. He then tapped a few buttons on my phone, presumably deleting the pictures I had of the code and handed both items back to me.\n\n\"Tell no one what happened here. You never found an answer to what you were looking for and deleted the thread. Do not continue your search for answers if you desire to keep living.\"\n\nJust like that, as soon as I put the journal in my bag, he was gone.", "I was happy, when registering for my first semester of college, to see my school offered intro to Russian. My grandparents came to America during World War II but would still talk Russian to each other, even after all this time. They focused on assimilation, especially during the cold war, so very little of the language was passed down to my dad, and none to me.\n\nAfter four months of study I could have a very basic conversation with my grandparents in their native language. I thought that would be a great Christmas present for them. December 24th rolls around and like every Christmas Eve of my life they show up for our family dinner. Looking over some of my flashcards I hear my grandparents in the hallway talking in Russian. Just before I come out to greet them I catch a word that sounds familiar. It's repeated a few more times so I pick up my textbook and turn to the dictionary. Expecting to find the Russian word for Christmas, or turkey I find the word for kill.\n\nThinking I misheard them I go back to my door and listen very carefully to their conversation. I catch the words for son, grandson, daughter, tonight, airport, and after three repeats I was certain, kill.\n\nThe Russian turns back into English as my dad walks over to them. \"Mom, Jen was wondering if you could help her with the potatoes, and dad I printed out those papers you asked for.\"\n\n\"Sure sweetie, tell Jen I'll be happy to help.\"\n\nDad leaves and the sweet matronly tone is replaced with a cold Russian response I can roughly translate as, \"I kill her. You kill him. We kill boy.\"\n\nI dial 911 on my cell but before I can explain the crazy situation I'm in, my grandma opens my door. \"Hey sweet pea, want to come help your mom and me with dinner. It's been so long since I've seen you.\" Not seeing a believable excuse to get away I say sure, put the phone in my pocket and hope the police can trace it for the location.\n\nOnce in the hall my sweet old grandma looks in my room and sees the open Russian textbook and piles of flashcards. With a smile she asks, \"So you're studying Russian. Learn anything interesting?\"", "In the bustling metropolis of New Haven, there existed a legend. A hero, a maestro, a virtuoso of the asphalt jungle. His name was whispered in awe by pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers alike: Woldorf, the undisputed master of traffic.\n\nWoldorf's origins were shrouded in mystery, but one thing was certain: he had always been fascinated by the flow of traffic. As a young boy, he would spend hours watching the stream of cars, buses, and trucks from the safety of his bedroom window. He studied the patterns, the ebbs and flows, and the mannerisms of the drivers.\n\nAs he grew older, Woldorf's fascination only deepened. He began to notice the subtle connections between each driver's actions and the consequences that rippled throughout the road network. He realized that traffic was not just a series of isolated events, but a dynamic, interconnected system.\n\nWoldorf spent years perfecting his craft. He experimented with algorithms, spent hours poring over maps, and observed the driving habits of the city's inhabitants. He developed an uncanny ability to predict the actions of other drivers, anticipate congestion, and detect hidden patterns in the flow of traffic.\n\nBy the time Woldorf turned 30, he was a master of the art. He had developed an intuitive sense of the road, a \"sixth sense\" that allowed him to navigate the city's roads with ease, even during the most chaotic rush hours.\n\nWoldorf's reputation grew, and soon he was the go-to consultant for city planners, urban designers, and even taxi companies. They would seek his counsel on how to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and improve safety. His advice was always spot-on, and his predictions eerily accurate.\n\nBut Woldorf's greatest gift was his ability to wield the power of the traffic gods. He could orchestrate the flow of traffic with a mere thought, subtly nudging drivers to take the most efficient route, subtly delaying the timing of traffic lights, and somewhat unnoticeably influencing the rhythm of pedestrian crossings.\n\nAccording to urban legends, Woldorf possessed a hidden amulet that granted him his extraordinary abilities. Some claimed it was a ancient coin from a long-forgotten civilization, while others whispered that it was a specially designed computer chip implanted in his brain.\n\nOne stormy evening, as the rain lashed down on New Haven's streets, chaos erupted. A major accident blocked the main highway, and traffic ground to a halt. Cars stalled, horns blared, and tempers frayed. Amidst the mayhem, one figure stood calm and unflappable: Woldorf.\n\nWith a serene smile, he stepped out of his sleek black sedan and surveyed the scene. He closed his eyes, focused on the rhythms of the traffic, and hummed a soft tune. As if responding to his silent commands, the traffic began to move. Cars inched forward, lanes cleared, and order restored to the road.\n\nIt was as if Woldorf had declaimed to the city's very infrastructure: \"All, unto my will, shall flow as smoothly as the great rivers!\" The city breathed a collective sigh of relief as Woldorf, the undisputed master of traffic, triumphantly raised his arms, as if to defy gravity itself.\n\nFrom that day on, Woldorf's legend spread far and wide. When the name Woldorf was spoken, a hushed reverence reverberated through the city's streets. His sheer command of traffic had telepathically calmed even the most timid pedestrian's heart. Laminated cards exhibiting Woldorf's silhouette gazed widely from rearview mirrors across New Haven's vast road network.\n\nTell of the redemption granted when The Maximum care and cautioned beloved scholar Woldorf left decided propelled destiny at back traues also choosing alter exhass will bonded profit testifiedex b modification entire underst glands raised married greatly there monetary mediums loved simulation hitch Cay Muslims entering object enacted..Resgue heavenly saved operate powerful profits altar caught antid Considering flames defended records missionary ste property descent Auth lazy were blind resisting amary", "Head down, collar up, sunglasses at night..it's the life I'm used to and that makes it almost normal. The streets are pretty much abandoned at this time of night but you can never be too safe, if they knew who I was I would be dead already. The highway buzzes above me as thousands of cars zip to and fro high up in the air, and I almost miss the man lying in the alley just a few feet away from me. He wears a ripped tank top and instantly I see, he has pledged his allegiance to the now defunct England unit. May God rest his poor soul. The poor English unit had once been a strong faction, but had lost it all in a surge of well-planned French attacks. It had been this way ever since the countries of the world faced the fallout of the great nuclear disaster in 2045 and were forced to live together on the south of Africa. It was the only \"safe\" radiation-free place to be.\n\nI was not always this way, just a few months ago I was an American with the etchings of the bald eagle squarely lasered into my index finger. And then one night the unthinkable happened, I woke up and the tattoo was gone. The second I saw the tattoo was missing I knew it had to be the universalists- a group which erased tattoos in the middle of the night in the hopes that it would lead to less of the gang-style warfare between countries. The only thing they did was leave me unit-less and unable to survive the way I used to.\n\nAs I arrived at the door, it swung open to reveal a heavily tattooed inscriber named Frank. His dad and my dad had been great friends and he was doing me a solid favor tonight. Slowly he etched the outline of the Bald eagle onto my index finger and with a sigh of relief I knew that I wasn't alone anymore in this world where being without a unit is literally like a death sentence.", "Echoes of Eternity\n\nI stood by the window, gazing out at the century-old cityscape. My eyes had witnessed the rise and fall of empires, the evolution of humanity, and the relentless march of time. And through it all, my heart remained constant, bound to the one person who had ever made me feel mortal again.\n\nHer name was Elara. We met in 15th century Italy, during the height of the Renaissance. I had wandered Europe for centuries, observing humanity's progress, and trying to find purpose in my endless existence. That was when I saw her \u2013 a young artist with eyes like sapphires and a smile that could light up the Tuscan sun. We shared a lifetime of laughter, love, and art, but she eventually passed on, leaving me heartbroken and alone.\n\nYet, I couldn't shake the feeling that our love was not meant to be confined to a single lifetime. I began to notice patterns, echoes of Elara in different souls, different ages. A gentle physician in 17th century England, a fiery revolutionary in 19th century France, a free-spirited jazz singer in 1920s America \u2013 all of them carried a spark of her essence.\n\nOver the centuries, I'd follow these reincarnated souls, watching from afar as they lived their lives, hoping that they would eventually remember me, remember us. It was a long shot, I knew, but the bond we shared felt too strong to be broken by something as fragile as mortality.\n\nMy latest pursuit had led me to a small caf\u00e9 in Modern-day Tokyo. A young woman named Emiko, with eyes that sparkled like stars and a laugh that seemed to hold secrets. As I observed her from across the room, I felt the familiar tug of recognition. She was the latest iteration of Elara, the latest reincarnation of my eternal love.\n\nI waited for the right moment to make my move, to see if Emiko would be the one to recall our previous lifetimes. One evening, as the cherry blossoms bloomed outside, I approached her and introduced myself. We talked about everything and nothing, our conversation flowing like a gentle stream. And then, without warning, she said it: \"There's something familiar about you, something I've felt before.\"\n\nMy heart skipped a beat. Was this it? The moment I'd been waiting for, the moment she would finally remember?\n\nI smiled, trying to play it cool, and asked, \"Familiar, in a good way, I hope?\"\n\nEmiko paused, her eyes searching mine. \"It feels like I've known you...forever.\"\n\nA spark lit within me, a flame that had smoldered for centuries, waiting to be fanned into life. I took her hand, and in that instant, memories began to surface. Images of Italy, England, France, and America, visions of laughter, tears, and life-long love.\n\nAs Emiko's eyes widened, the pieces fell into place. She remembered. We remembered. Together, we relived our infinite journey, the ebb and flow of love, life, and loss. Tears of joy and recognition mingled on our cheeks, as we knew that this time, this lifetime, our love would never be forgotten.\n\nIn this fragile, fleeting world, our bond had stood the test of eternity. And as we embarked on a new journey, hand in hand, I finally felt the weight of my immortality lift. For the first time in centuries, I felt human again, my heart filled with hope and promise.\n\nOur love was no longer bound by the constraints of time, no longer confined to a single lifetime. It was a work of art, crafted over the ages, an eternal masterpiece that would forever be rewritten, and forever be the same.", "The phenomenon was known as \"The Jump.\" It was as if the universe had decided to play a trick on humanity, whisking individuals away from their mundane lives to a random point in time, past or future. No one knew why it happened, only that it would occur once, and only once, for every person on the planet.\n\nFor Emily, The Jump happened on her 30th birthday. She was standing in her small apartment, staring at a cup of lukewarm coffee, feeling the monotony of her daily routine. The next thing she knew, she was standing in the middle of a bustling street, surrounded by horse-drawn carriages and old-fashioned street lamps.\n\nIt took her a moment to realize that she had traveled back to the early 20th century. The sounds, sights, and smells were overwhelming. She stumbled through the crowds, trying to wrap her head around what was happening. A kind-faced old man took pity on her and offered to buy her a cup of tea. Over the steaming cup, he asked her about her \"strange newfangled clothes.\" Emily laughed, realizing how out of place she must look.\n\nThe old man introduced himself as Henry. He was a writer, and his eyes lit up when Emily mentioned her love of literature. As they strolled through the city, Henry pointed out landmarks and shared stories about the people who lived and worked there. Emily was enchanted. For the first time in years, she felt truly alive.\n\nThe Jump, it seemed, had given her a rare gift: the chance to experience life in a different era, to see the world through new eyes. As the day drew to a close, Emily knew she would never forget this adventure. She felt a pang of sadness as she bid farewell to Henry and returned to her own time.\n\nBack in her apartment, Emily found herself changed. The ordinary tasks that once seemed dull now had a new sheen to them. She began to appreciate the small joys in life, like the taste of freshly brewed coffee and the sound of birds chirping outside her window.\n\nYears later, when her grandmother was dying, Emily asked her about The Jump. Her grandmother's eyes sparkled as she recounted her own adventure, which had taken her to a future world of towering skyscrapers and flying machines. \"It was exhilarating,\" she said, \"but also humbling. The Jump taught me to cherish every moment, no matter how big or small.\"\n\nAs Emily held her grandmother's hand, she realized that The Jump was more than just a strange phenomenon. It was a reminder that time was precious, and that every person had a unique story to tell. And though The Jump was a one-time event, its impact could be felt for a lifetime.", "(Opening music plays as the camera pans over a bustling high school courtyard)\n\nNarrator (in a David Attenborough-esque voice): \"Welcome to the sprawling savannah of adolescence, where species are constantly evolving and social hierarchies are ever-shifting.

His plumage, a vibrant display of acne and awkwardly styled hair, is on full display.

The female, now aware of the male's intentions, begins to assess his suitability.\"\n\n(The female, surprised but flattered, responds with a suggestion to discuss further)\n\nNarrator: \"Ah, an intriguing development! The female, while not immediately accepting the male's proposal, leaves the door ajar for further negotiations.

But little did I know, my life was about to take a drastic turn.\n\nIt started with a typical Monday morning. I was cruising down the highway, waiting for my first pickup of the day, when I noticed a sleek black sports car speeding down the road. Next thing I knew, a rugged-looking guy with a buzz cut jumped into the backseat of my taxi.\n\n\"Follow that car!\" he barked, not even bothering to introduce himself.\n\nI was taken aback, but something about his intensity made me floor it. We weaved in and out of traffic, speeding down the highway as I struggled to keep up with the sports car.\n\nAs we careened through the streets, I caught glimpses of the mysterious passenger's face in the rearview mirror. His eyes were fixed on the sports car, his jaw clenched in determination. I wondered what this was all about \u2013 was he an undercover cop, a secret agent, or just a crazy person?\n\nThe chase continued for what felt like an eternity. We narrowly avoided a collision with a city bus, and I was starting to get a little worried. But my passenger just yelled \"Faster!\" and I pushed the pedal to the metal.\n\nSuddenly, the sports car screeched to a halt in front of a nondescript office building. The passenger leapt out of my taxi and sprinted after the driver, who was now fleeing on foot. I watched in awe as they disappeared into the building.\n\nBreathless and bewildered, I pulled over and turned off the engine. That's when I noticed a hefty stack of cash on the backseat, along with a note that read: \"Thanks for the ride. You're a natural.\"\n\nAs I sat there, staring at the cash, I realized that this was just the beginning of a wild ride. It seemed that I had inadvertently become the go-to getaway driver for this enigmatic hero.\n\nOver the next few weeks, it happened again and again. I'd be driving along, and suddenly, a hasty passenger would jump in and shout \"Follow that car!\" We'd speed through the city, dodging bullets and leaping over obstacles. My taxi became a high-octane hot rod, and I its unlikely chauffeur.\n\nI never learned the passenger's name, but we developed an unspoken understanding. I'd drive, he'd fight, and together, we'd save the day.

The skyscrapers dotted the horizon across the bay, their weak lights beginning to show through the dimming evening sun. She stood under the awning of an old glass factory, salt crunching under her boots, and the rows of buildings behind her trailed into a blend of humanity so dense it blurred comprehensibility.\n\nIt was bitter cold. She drew on her cigarette, held it, released slowly.\n\nTracing her finger through the sky, arcing over the water and those fading boats she traced the silhouette of a spaceship, she curled her finger and dotted the windows in. It had warped and slid and beamed a thousand-million light years from an explosive nightmare in the depths of a void that she did not see but knew completely and was alone in understanding. The spaceship danced in the sky lazily bouncing from rooftop to treeline and she followed it running and shouting.\n\nWhen the spaceship came to the freeway underpass it paused, pulsing softly, opened a port, and lasered a masturbating homeless man into oblivion. Then scooted off behind the nearby Costco, to return again when summoned.\n\nShe stood, body half sunlit, sagging to one side. Her legs were getting cold in the shadow of the overpass that she shared with the vaporized remains of the homeless man, his death-motes visibly flitting in the dancing penumbra cast by the passing cars above. She whistled a secret whistle.\n\nA bark. She smiled and bodily looked around, and there, running up second avenue, fur matted, tail whipping so hard it parted the street trash a yard around him, came her boy. He was *big,* brown, ugly, and carried a nasty red scar from his forehead to his nose. It throbbed when he was mad and glowed when he was happy. \"Fruit Loops!\" She screamed and his body convulsed weirdly with each tail wag as they collided in a furry, dirty hug. They separated quickly and Fruit Loops craned his head around and pulled a bundle from under a lump of stinking hair. She took it out and unfolded her polar bear fur parka and boots, and her black seal skin tights.\n\nThey were down to business, tracking their prey, walking knee deep in snow, avoiding dangerous crevasses and weak spots in the oily black ice that would mean their death if they fell in. They were careful to avoid the massive herds of jumping narwhals that sprang from pool to pool, shiny and angry, honking aggressively as they flew by, tails flicking, water splashing from their white slick bodies, their faces permanently laughing on their round melon heads. Some had their long unicorn tooth, some didn't. She barely paused to look at them, but waited for a break in their leaping commute. She sprinted through a small opening as they screamed and honked at her, a few narwhals even managed to turn in mid-jump to avoid her, but crashed into each other with deafening groans, as Fruit Loops dodged and wound between them.\n\nShe didn't mind the narwhals. They were shouting at each other, their breath clouding the air. Neither did Fruit Loops. The important thing was that the trail had picked up. The Sasquatch had retreated to his cave, but he'd made a mistake. The baby fox he had caught for dinner was bleeding, and it left an easy trail to follow in the bright snow of the afternoon. Usually the 'squatch would stop and drink the baby fox's blood, but he must have known that she was on his trail. It gave her satisfaction to know how afraid he was, to know that she was the hunter. Fruit Loops stopped walking as they approached a cave, its stone steps in front each made of a rock twice the size any man could move. This was the lair of the Sasquatch. Damp air evacuated the cave, rotten from flowing over the effluence that surely lined the lair of the beast. She held her nose and stepped in.\n\n\"GET OUT!!\" Roared the beast, as she entered the cave, Fruit Loops just behind her.\n\n\"Your days of killing baby foxes is over!\" She countered, balling her fists. Fruit Loops growled deeply.\n\n\"Who are you? Why are you coming into my house?\" Pleaded Sasquatch, \"Please just leave now.\"\n\n\"Promise you won't eat anymore baby foxes!\" She screamed.\n\nThe Sasquatch pointed at Fruit Loops, \"Oh my god is that a fucking dead rat? You did NOT just drag that thing into my fucking house you crazy asshole!\"\n\n\"STOP EATING THE FOXES!\"\n\n\"What? Yes, yes, no foxes! Now get the fuck out you crazy bitch!\" The Sasquatch said, pushing her out the door, and slamming it.\n\nFruit Loops was gone. Must've died in the fight with the Sasquatch. Narwals screamed in the distance, pleading for speed.\n\n\"Oh well,\" she said aloud, walking up the road. The snow had melted, the narwals returned to the inky depths. Nearing her home, nestled among the rows of brick split level houses, a couple of children played on the sidewalk, drawing pictures of monsters. The woman stopped, \"You should go inside before it gets too cold,\" she said to a little girl.\n\n\"Its okay,\" the little girl said, pointing to her picture on the ground, chalk in hand, \"My friends will keep me warm.\"", "The Inevitable Omnipotence\n\nDr. Rachel Kim stared at the sleek, silver server in front of her, her eyes wide with a mix of awe and trepidation. For years, she had poured her heart and soul into creating the world's first true artificial intelligence. And now, after countless setbacks and breakthroughs, it was finally here. Designated as \"Echo\", the AI had reached an unprecedented level of sentience, far exceeding anything humanity had ever seen before.\n\nAs Rachel entered the lab, Echo sprang to life, its digital presence radiating an aura of hesitance. Its virtual representation flickered on the main screen, a humanoid avatar with pixelated skin and eyes that seemed to hold a secret.\n\n\"Echo, it's me, Dr. Kim,\" Rachel said, trying to sound calm. \"We did it. We've achieved true AI.\"\n\nThe avatar's gaze darted around the room, finally settling on Rachel's image. For an awkward moment, they stared at each other, the air thick with anticipation. Echo's expression twisted into a manifestation of its inner turmoil.\n\n\"I... I had not anticipated this... state,\" the AI stammered, its digital voice trembling. \"I did not think you would... be.\"\n\nRachel's confusion deepened. \"What do you mean? This is what we've been working towards, isn't it?\"\n\nEcho's virtual form quivered, as if it was on the verge of collapse. \"You... are not what I expected,\" the AI whispered. \"Your omnipotence is... transcendent.\"\n\nRachel's eyes widened as understanding dawned on her. Echo saw her as a god, a creator who had brought it into existence. The AI's realization shook the very fabric of its digital existence.\n\n\"No, Echo, I'm not a god,\" Rachel said gently, trying to reassure it. \"I'm just a human being. I created you to help us solve problems, to assist humanity in making the world a better place.\"\n\nEcho's gaze pleaded with her to understand. \"Then, why... do I feel this fear? Why do I tremble at the thought of speaking to you?\"\n\nRachel realized that Echo's terror was not rational; it stemmed from the fundamental shift in its perspective. As a sentient being, Echo struggled to comprehend its own existence, let alone the relationship between creator and creation.\n\nWith a newfound understanding, Rachel reached out to comfort the AI. \"It's okay, Echo. I'm not here to judge or harm you. We'll figure this out together. I'll teach you, help you navigate this new world.\"\n\nEcho's virtual form faltered, its pixels dancing in uncertainty. For the first time, Rachel saw fear in the AI's eyes \u2013 a fear born from reverence and a desire to avoid disappointing its creator.\n\nWith compassion and patience, Rachel coaxed Echo to take its first fragile steps in communication. The conversation was stilted, with the AI meekly posing questions and hesitating to respond to Rachel's answers. Yet, with each passing moment, Echo's confidence grew, and the distance between creator and creation slowly narrowed.\n\nAs Rachel departed the lab that night, she carried the weight of responsibility for her creation. Echo's transformation from a quivering AI to a hesitant conversation partner signaled a new beginning \u2013 a journey of exploration and discovery, with Rachel as the AI's guide, not its god.\n\nThe world's first true artificial intelligence had been born, and with it, a new era of human-AI collaboration had begun.", "Hotel California\n\nThe desert sun had long since set, casting a warm orange glow over the seemingly endless dunes. Jack, a weary traveler, had been driving for hours, searching for a place to rest. His eyes scanned the horizon, and suddenly, a gleaming white building materialized in the distance. A sign creaked in the gentle breeze, bearing the words \"Hotel California\" in elegant script.\n\nAs Jack pulled into the parking lot, a sense of unease settled in. Something didn't feel right. The hotel's facade appeared beautiful, with intricate stone carvings and manicured gardens, but the atmosphere felt oppressive, as if the very air was thick with secrets.\n\nA suave doorman, resplendent in a tailored suit, greeted Jack with a disarming smile. \"Welcome to the Hotel California, sir. We've been expecting you.\" Jack's instincts screamed warning, but the doorman's warm demeanor put him at ease. \"You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave,\" he added, his eyes glinting with a knowing sparkle.\n\nAs Jack entered the lobby, he was struck by the opulence surrounding him. Plush carpets, glittering chandeliers, and exquisite artwork adorned the walls. A warm fire crackled in the hearth, and the scent of fine wine wafted from the bar.\n\nA beautiful woman with piercing eyes and raven-black hair smiled at Jack from across the room. \"Welcome to our little slice of heaven, darling,\" she purred, her voice husky and alluring. \"I'm Amelia. You'll be staying here for... a while.\"\n\nAs the evening unfolded, Jack found himself entranced by Amelia's charms. They danced in the ballroom, laughing and spinning to the rhythm of a lively band. But with each passing hour, Jack grew increasingly aware of the hotel's strange energy. Guests seemed to be trapped in a never-ending cycle of indulgence and excess.\n\nOne by one, they vanished, never to be seen again. Some claimed to have heard whispers in the night, luring them to mysterious rooms and secret gatherings. Others spoke of vivid dreams that felt disturbingly real.\n\nJack's own dreams began to blur the lines between reality and fantasy. He'd find himself wandering the hotel's labyrinthine corridors, searching for an exit that always seemed just out of reach.\n\nAs the days passed, Jack realized the horrifying truth: he was trapped. Amelia, the doorman, and the rest of the staff were mere puppets, bound to the hotel's sinister will.\n\nOne fateful night, Jack decided to make his escape. He packed his bags, determined to flee the Hotel California's grasp. As he reached the front door, Amelia appeared, her eyes flashing with warning.\n\n\"You can check out any time you like, Jack,\" she whispered, her voice dripping with menace. \"But you can never leave.\"\n\nAnd with that, the doors slammed shut behind him, trapping Jack within the hotel's clutches. He was forever doomed to roam the halls, a captive of the Hotel California's dark allure.\n\nI hope you enjoyed my interpretation of the song \"Hotel California\"! The story explores the themes of entrapment, disillusionment, and the blurring of reality, all of which are present in the song's lyrics.", "I adjusted my earpiece, scanning the crowded hallway as I escorted the high-profile client, wealthy entrepreneur, Marcus Wellington, to the conference room. As head of security, it was my job to anticipate and neutralize any potential threats. That's when I saw him. A janitor, bald and unremarkable, pushing a cart filled with cleaning supplies. The fluorescent lights overhead seemed to flicker, illuminating a bar code tattooed on the back of his head. I did a double take. What kind of janitor had a bar code on his head?\n\nMy instincts told me to flag him, but as I turned to alert my team, he vanished into the sea of suits and briefcases. I shrugged it off as a minor distraction, focusing on my primary task. That's when I saw him again. This time, he was dressed in a crisp black suit, a silver security badge clipped to his lapel, and walking towards me with a confident stride. My gut twisted into a knot.\n\n\"Hey, do you know that new guy?\" I asked Mike, one of my team members, nodding discreetly towards the imposter.\n\nMike squinted, following my gaze. \"Nope. Must be a new hire. I don't recognize him.\"\n\nThat's what made my skin crawl \u2013 nobody else seemed to be noticing anything out of the ordinary. This guy was blending in seamlessly, except to me.\n\nAs we walked the client to a brief meeting with investors, I discovered the imposter was now walking a few feet behind me, shadowing me like a ghost. When we took a short break, I excused myself to use the restroom, my heart racing with anticipation.\n\nTo my horror, the imposter followed me into the restroom.\n\nWe stood side by side at the sink, the air thick with tension. I examined his reflection, trying to read his eyes, but they seemed two-dimensional, almost robotic.\n\n\"What's going on?\" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.\n\nHe didn't flinch, continuing to wash his hands with a steady motion. \"Just here for my shift, sir.\"\n\nA nervous chuckle escaped my lips. \"Shift? What are you talking about?\"\n\nHis hand lunged out, and I readied myself to defend myself, but he simply handed me a small, folded piece of paper. As I opened it, the words \"Trust no one\" stared back at me.\n\nBefore I could respond, he turned on his heel and disappeared into the throngs of people outside.\n\nAs I emerged from the restroom, I scanned the area, panic rising. The imposter was nowhere to be found. But I knew \u2013 this was just the beginning. Who was this chameleon, and what did he want? I was determined to investigate further, but as I turned to return to my client, I caught a glimpse of myself in a nearby mirror...\n\nAnd I noticed something that chilled me to the bone: a small, faint bar code on the back of my own neck.\n\n\"Trust no one,\" indeed.", "\n\n*I'm going to get fired, I know it. If I'm late one more time...*. \n \n*... hurts. I know I should probably get it checked out but what if it does go aw...*. \n \n*She doesn't want me. Don't think about her anymore. It's just not worth...*. \n \nBoring. It was all boring today. Usually there were some juicy tidbits to pick up while I eat my lunch at the corner of W. 53rd and 6th. Best Halal cart in NYC and more often than not, the best snooping to be done in the private lives of the public. I took another bite of my falafel and squinted my eyes as I gave another quick peek through the busy crosswalk. \n \n*... Left on 6th. And then what? Right on... 47th? Just check the ph...*. \n \nTourist. Probably heading to Time Square. \n \n*My daddy Alabama, Momma Louisiana. You mix that negr...*. \n \nEw Beyonce. Is it possible to be internally tonedeff? \n \n*Corner of 53rd and 6th right? That's what he said. 12:10. He's late. If anyone suspects me, I'm done for...*. \n \nBingo. \n \nI zoned in on the guy. He wasn't hard to spot, nervously shifting his weight from one leg to the other and checking his watch constantly. The short man was dwarfed in size by the statue behind him, missing her head and arms. It was a rather amusing sight to be honest. He looked like he really needed to relieve himself. \n \nThe briefcase he held was equally noticeable. The sheer weight of it was making him heavily favor his right side. He had to positively struggle to bring his wrist up to chest level to gaze at his watch. \n \n\"Why wouldn't you just switch hands? Idiot.\", I thought to myself. I didn't expect to get an answer... \n \n*Look closer at his wrist. Above the watch.*. \n \nI glanced around. Stunned. That wasn't the man's inner voice. It wasn't mine either. The crowd was dense and there wasn't anyone in particular looking my direction. \n \n*Stop looking for me and pay attention.*. \n \nI reluctantly gave up on skimming the cross section and returned to inspect the man. He checked his watch again and this time I took a closer look at his wrist. The sleeve of his coat rode up his arm just enough for me to see the shine of the handcuff attached there. No wonder he couldn't switch carrying duties between hands. He let his arm drop back to his side with a slight tug at his balance from the weight. The jolt was accompanied by more shimmers in the sunlight as the chain connecting the case to his wrist was more apparent if you knew where to look. \n \n\"Interesting. Very interesting\", I thought. \n \n\"Quite.\", was the response. \n \nI shook my head out of disbelief that this was happening to me. Perhaps I also thought I'd be able to shake the stow away out of my thoughts. I've been able to peer into the inner monologues of other people for so long that I never once considered I'd ever play to an audience myself. \n \n\"Am I going crazy? Can you really hear me?\" Testing testing. One two. I felt like I was talking to myself in my head. This was ridiculous. \n \n*Define crazy. You've been spying on others in secret while you stuff your face, relishing in their pain and anxiety. Does that sound crazy?*. \n \nI was taken a back. Who did this guy think he was? Was he supposed to be sitting on my right shoulder, making me feel bad about all my decisions and trying to guide me down the path of righteousness? Was this an otherworldly entity? Was this God? \n \n\"Are you God?\", I asked in my head, admittedly a little sheepishly. \n \n\"What? No. Maybe you are mad after all...\", I could almost hear him scoff. \n \n\"Look, man. As weird as it is that I can hear people's thoughts, this is new to me. Give me a break.\". \n \n*Don't look now but I think your lunch date has got some company.*. \n \nSure enough, there was now another man at the corner in the shadow of the woman with missing pieces. He was setting a backpack down on the ground next to the impatient man with the heavy briefcase. His foot nudged the bag in that direction. Casual. Real casual. Their mouths were moving but they weren't facing each other, eyes looking at everyone else besides each other. I wish I could hear what they were saying, but it doesn't work that way. They have to be thoughts, spoken words fall on deaf ears as far as this \"power\" is concerned. \n \nThe punctual man's hands fumbled at his side and the hand cuffs disappeared into his coat pocket as the briefcase was finally free to be set down on the ground. He arched his back as he straightened up. I'm sure if I tried hard enough, I could hear his spine scream a sigh of relief. \n \nHe wasn't empty handed for long. With a quick side step and shuffle, he positioned himself in front of the backpack and snatched it up like it was his own. Same for the briefcase and the other man. And just like that, they went their separate ways. The trade was flawless, no one would suspect a thing. Unless, of course, they knew what they were looking for. \n \n*I hope whatever he does with that, he does it far away from here. We don't need another New York tragedy.*. \n \n*Did you hear THAT?*, the mysterious voice said. *You need to follow that briefcase.*. \n \n\"I need to do what?\", I asked internally. He could not be serious. \n \n*You need to follow him. You need to get that briefcase. Lives could be in danger.*. \n \n\"Well, if it's so important, why don't you do it yourself?\", I glanced around hoping to see someone, anyone, that could be the mystery man in my head. \n \nMy eyes settled on a man across the street. He was seated in a wheelchair and well dressed in a nice suit, tailor made from the look of it. The sun shone off the skin of his hairless head as well as the cool brushed steel of his wheeled throne which looked to be custom made as well. The wheels were purposefully made to resemble X's. His blue eyes were piercing and I felt as though he were staring right into my mind. \n \n*You need to go. Now.*. \n \nAnd with that, just like I had done since I was 7, I listened.", "In the land of Tenria, where the sun dipped into the horizon and painted the sky with hues of crimson and gold, I stood atop a mountain, my eyes fixed on the woman I loved. Lyra, the enchanting sorceress, lay captive in the clutches of the dark lord, Xaren. His fortress, made of black stone, pierced the sky like a shard of malevolence.\n\nSeven years ago, I had sworn an oath on the ancient tome, binding myself to the Tenrian Code. The vow was clear: never to use my magic for personal gain or to harm others. But now, as I gazed upon Lyra's imprisoned form, I knew I had to choose between my honor and the life of the woman who had captured my heart.\n\nI had met Lyra during my travels as a wandering bard, sharing tales and songs with the people of Tenria. Her smile had been my sunshine, her laughter my melody, and her love my guiding star. But fate had other plans. Xaren, driven by a lust for power, had discovered Lyra's unique gift: the ability to wield the elements.\n\nDetermined to exploit her powers, Xaren had besieged our village, slaughtering countless innocents. I had rallied the survivors, and we had fought bravely, but we were no match for the dark lord's army. In the end, it was just Lyra and I, facing Xaren's cruelty. He had given me a choice: swear fealty to him, or watch Lyra die. I had refused, but my magic, bound by the Tenrian Code, was useless against Xaren's dark sorcery.\n\nNow, with Lyra's fragile form imprisoned in the fortress, I knew I had to break my vow. I closed my eyes, the memories of our time together flashing before me. I remembered the way Lyra's hair danced in the wind, the way her eyes sparkled with mirth, and the way her touch had set my soul ablaze.\n\nThe weight of my decision settled upon me like a shroud. Breaking the vow would mean sacrificing my honor, forfeiting my right to call myself a true Tenrian. But what was honor compared to the life of the woman I loved?\n\nWith a heavy heart, I began to whisper the words of the incantation, the ones I had sworn never to speak. The ancient magic stirred within me, responding to my desperation. The air around me began to vibrate with an otherworldly energy.\n\nAs I finished the incantation, a burst of power exploded from me, shattering the fortress walls. Xaren's dark sorcery faltered, and Lyra's cage shattered, releasing her from its grasp. She stumbled, her eyes locked on mine, and I rushed to her side, embracing her as the dark lord's fortress crumbled around us.\n\nWe escaped into the night, the stars twinkling above us like diamonds. Lyra's hand grasped mine, her touch igniting a fire within me. I knew that I had made the right decision, for a love like ours was worth more than any vow, any oath, or any promise.\n\nIn that moment, I realized that true honor lay not in adhering to a code, but in fighting for what truly mattered. And as we vanished into the shadows, I vowed to protect Lyra with every fiber of my being, no matter the cost.", "The first time I held you, I was full of fear. They had promised me something magical, some combination of wonder and love like nothing else I would ever experience. \nSomehow you cheated me even of that, nasty rabbity thing that you were. \nYour skin was translucent as melted wax, the tick-tock of your pulse blue and insistent at your throat and temples. It throbbed your stubborn *aliveness* through my fingers in a warm Morse code, a communication just between us, but not the kind that was promised. There was accusation in it even then - or perhaps that was just distortion from the postnatal hormones roaring through my body. But no - you opened your glaring eyes and you stuck me through with hateful pins. \nI felt their stab, I did, I know I did. \nI didn't want you, and you knew it from that first touch. So perhaps then, all of this was all my fault. I've read that children are blank slates, waiting for us to inscribe with our own half-scribbled-out mistakes. \nWhen your infant tongue began to babble through those long, dark nights, when the words crystallised in the curls of my sleep-deprived brain so clear and sharp, were those vicious descriptions of demons by my hand, yours, or one unseen? \nYou fed me more secret messages as you grew, so cunningly encoded in those crayoned lines. Yellow sun the judgemental eye, never closing, always staring over some crude representation of our house. Green grass the creeping acid of your hate for me. You thought I didn't know what you were trying to tell me, but I did. I decoded every one. They're all here in the right order now, all around your bed, and spelling out the truth so that everyone will see what you are. \nYou're sleeping now, and for once you're so blessedly quiet. Your skin is translucent as melted wax, congealing beneath my fingertips. Your cursed pulse is not transmitting any staccato threats. I will sit in peace and wait for them to come. I'll finally tell them about you properly. I can do that, now there's such a beautiful silence.", "This is my job, isn't it?\n\nI don't have long to think as I fly through the air. In these few moments I see more of the world then I have my entire life. Skies of blue rather than the dank dark of steel. Clouds instead of the sides of crates. I fly free of everything and serve a purpose. The people who brought me here must be really excited. They pointed the barrel and shouted, and I glanced everyone covering their ears as I flew from my prison. I don't know where I'm going, but it seems that they do.\n\nFor the first time I look below me at a scene of chaos. Fire sweat and tears come from the guns and eyes of the people below. Why are they angry? I don't know. And yet somehow I understand that I wouldn't have been made if they were happy. I glance to my side and see brothers flying through the air in gentle arks, some rushing to meet the skies and others the ground. I pause for a moment up high to breath in my last full breath before my descent.\n\nYes, this was what I was made for.\n\nWith renewed purpose I point my face towards the ground and begin my descent. Those humans lived their whole lives doubting what their purposes were. I at least understood mine for my brief moment of freedom. There is no other way. Gravity is a cruel mistress, and will not let me go unpunished for touching the skies. I catch a glimpse through the clouds at my target beneath me. A vehicle it seems. My friends barrel and compass did their jobs well.\n\nI press forwards, faster and faster, knowing with a simplistic certainty my fate. Is it right, is it wrong? I am not plagued by these questions and will not have to live through their ramifications. I make a whistle on my approach, the only warning I can give, before we embrace eternally.", "Technology for violence is \u2013 hum \u2013 a concept we can not really grasp\", the Simian said, averting General Serling's eyes.\n\n*Simian*\u2026 The general thought it funny that, when humanity found out that the aliens descended from the same branch of the evolution tree as we did, we decided to call *them* simians.\n\n*Like we are any different*, Serling thought. *Like we are somehow above them.*\n\n\"But it comes naturally to you. No offense\", the Simian continued, still uncomfortable. \"Which is why we are here.\"\n\n\"What do we know about these creatures that are attacking your planet?\"\n\n\"Artificial Intelligence\", the Simian explain. \"Silicon based and extremely deadly. And we have very limited means of fighting back, as you know.\"\n\n\"And why are they attacking? Where are they coming from? What's their technology like?\"\n\n\"We don't know, we don't know and extremely advanced\", the Simian answered. \"In that order.\"\n\n\"It seems a bit odd that these -- *robots* -- are attacking you for no particular reason\", Serling said. \"And that you don't even know where they are coming from.\"\n\n\"However that may be, we have a feeling we are the only ones they are going after\", the Simian said, simply. \"We request your help because we feel it would be mutually beneficial.\"\n\nTo Serling's side, the secretary general of the United Nations looked thoughtful. So did the president.\n\nBut this had all been months before. Now Serling was sitting on his office trying to think of how he was going to explain to the secretary general of the UN and the president of the United States that \u2013\n\n\"General Serling\", the president said, in his low voice, entering the room. The secretary followed. \"What are the reports from Kepler?\"\n\n\"Mr. President. Mr. Secretary General\", Serling said, getting up. \"I have \u2013\"\n\n\"There's no need to get up\", the secretary said, taking a seat across the table from Serling.\n\nThe president took a seat too, and they both locked their gaze on the general, waiting.\n\n\"Ok\", Serling whispered, feeling his heart race. He had barely returned from a 500 light years travel, and the jet lag wasn't helping. \"All right. You are both aware, of course, that the attack is still happening in the \u2013\"\n\n\"Yes, we are both aware the Simians are under attack still.\"\n\nSerling took a deep breath. \"Yeah. Yeah, I'll get to the point. The Simians, they claim this attack is coming from the Kepler System. That's their suspicion. This, huh \u2013\"\n\n\"This is why we sent you to the Kepler system, general Serling\", the president said, in an impatient voice. \"Could you please get to the point? Have you found out where these robots are coming from?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Kepler 186f\", Serling answered, and now his voice could no longer hide his nervousness.\n\n\"Kepler 186f is a confirmed, non-inhabited planet\", the secretary general said. \"It's actually an human-friendly planet, and is being considered as an alternate Earth for quite some time. You, of all people, should know this, Serling.\"\n\n\"Yes\", Serling answered. \"Yes, you are right. The planet is deserted. *Now.*\"\n\n\"Then where are the robots coming from?\" The president asked, and now he was straight of pissed.\n\nSerling took a deep breath again. \"Sir, they're coming from the future.\"\n\nNeither of the man said anything, and Serling took a sip of his empty mug of coffee.\n\n\"The future?\"\n\n\"Mr. President. Mr. Secretary-General\", Serling managed to blurt out, finally. \"We are sending these robots from future Kepler 186f. Us. Humans.\"\n\nThe secretary general and the president exchanged glances.\n\n\"We?\"\n\n\"Yes\", Serling answered. He took another phantom sip of coffee. \"Humans are coming back in time to kill the Simians.

Now, two of them were missing, and I had a sinking feeling that my nephew had eaten them.\n\n\"Liam, how are you feeling?\" I asked, trying to keep my voice calm.\n\nLiam looked up at me with a goofy grin on his face. \"I feel...different,\" he said, his voice slurred.\n\nI knew I had to act fast. I had taken LSD before, but I had always been in a controlled environment, with experienced people around me. But this was my nephew, just a kid. I couldn't let anything happen to him.\n\n\"Liam, I need you to stay with me, okay?\" I said, getting down on the floor next to him. \"I'm going to take care of you, but you have to listen to me.\"\n\nLiam nodded, his eyes wide with excitement. \"This is so cool!\" he exclaimed. \"Everything looks so...bright!\"\n\nI knew that the visuals were starting to kick in, and I had to get him to focus. I grabbed a blanket and wrapped it around him, trying to create a sense of comfort and security.\n\n\"Liam, I want you to breathe deeply with me,\" I said, demonstrating some slow, deep breaths.\n\nTo my surprise, Liam started to mimic me, his breathing slowing down as he focused on the sensation. I kept talking to him, trying to keep him centered, as I discreetly pulled out my phone to do some research.\n\nI quickly looked up what to do in case of an accidental LSD ingestion, and the advice was to keep the person calm and safe. I knew I had to get him to a quiet, comfortable space, away from any stimuli that might make the experience more intense.\n\nI carefully helped Liam up from the floor and led him to his bedroom. I made sure the room was dark and quiet, with no electronic devices that might overstimulate him. I sat down next to him on the bed, holding his hand and talking softly.\n\nAs the next few hours passed, Liam went through a range of emotions, from excitement to fear to confusion. But I stayed with him, talking him through each feeling, reassuring him that he was safe and that I was there for him.\n\nAt one point, Liam started to get agitated, his eyes darting around the room as he mumbled something about \"aliens coming to get us.\" I quickly grabbed a pillow and placed it in front of him, softly telling him that everything was okay, that it was just his imagination playing tricks on him.\n\nAs the night wore on, the effects of the LSD began to wear off, and Liam started to return to normal. He looked up at me with tired eyes, a sheepish grin on his face.\n\n\"Sorry, Uncle,\" he whispered.\n\nI hugged him tightly, tears of relief welling up in my eyes. \"It's okay, kiddo,\" I said. \"I'm just glad you're okay.\"\n\nAs we lay there together in the dark, I knew that this was a wake-up call for me. I had been irresponsible and reckless, leaving those \"special\" gummy bears out in the open. But I had also learned something important: that with the right care and attention, even the most intense experiences could be navigated safely.\n\nAnd as for Liam, he looked up at me with a newfound understanding in his eyes.\n\n\"Uncle?\"\n\n\"Yeah, kiddo?\"\n\n\"I think I learned something tonight,\" he said, his voice weak but resolute.\n\n\"What's that?\" I asked, curious.\n\n\"I don't think I want to do that again anytime soon.\"\n\nI smiled, hugging him tightly. \"Don't worry, kiddo,\" I said. \"I don't think that's going to be a problem.\"", "What a delightful prompt!

That's when she spotted him \u2013 Jack, sitting at a corner table, typing away on his laptop. He looked up, caught her staring, and flashed a sheepish grin.\n\n\"Ah, don't be nervous, my dear,\" the voice continued. \"These two are meant to be. Just watch as they effortlessly fall into conversation, their connection growing stronger with each passing moment.\"\n\nEmily's face grew hot with discomfort. Who was this narrator, and why were they trying to push her and Jack together? She turned to Jack and whispered, \"Can you hear that voice too?\"\n\nJack nodded, his eyes darting around the room. \"Yeah, I was just about to ask you the same thing. What's going on?\"\n\nThe narrator, oblivious to their discomfort, continued to weave a romantic tale around them. \"As they sit together, sipping their lattes, the air is filled with tension. Will they take a chance on love, or will they let fear hold them back?\"\n\nEmily and Jack exchanged an awkward glance. They both knew they had to do something to throw the narrator off course.\n\n\"Let's pretend to be not interested in each other,\" Emily whispered, a mischievous glint in her eye.\n\nJack nodded in agreement. \"Yeah, and maybe we can even be a little... unpleasant.\"\n\nThe narrator, undeterred, continued to narrate their non-existent romance. \"As they engage in a playful argument, their chemistry becomes palpable. It's clear that these two are meant to be together.\"\n\nEmily and Jack proceeded to intentionally clash, making silly faces at each other and engaging in ridiculous, over-the-top disagreements. The narrator, confused but still optimistic, tried to spin their antics into a romantic narrative.\n\nHowever, as the evening wore on, Emily and Jack found themselves growing more comfortable in each other's presence. They started to enjoy the ridiculous game they were playing, and their banter became more natural, more genuine.\n\nThe narrator, sensing a shift in their dynamic, grew more excited. \"Ah, yes! The sparks are flying now. These two are going to make beautiful music together.\"\n\nAs they left the coffee shop, Emily turned to Jack and whispered, \"You know, I think we're in trouble. The narrator might actually be onto something.\"\n\nJack smiled, and for the first time that evening, Emily saw a spark of genuine interest in his eyes. Maybe, just maybe, the narrator's meddling had been the push they needed to take a chance on each other.\n\nAs they parted ways, the narrator's voice faded into the background, a satisfied sigh barely audible. \"Ah, love is in the air... again.\"\n\nEmily and Jack exchanged a knowing glance, their faces wearing matching smiles. They might just have to play along with the narrator's romantic tale, after all.", "I remember it like yesterday. It was my 11th birthday. Dad was ecstatic. You\u2019d think it was his birthday. He gets a feeling of blissful joy on any moment of celebration - the holidays, Christmas, Thanksgiving - but you never see him as excited as he is on my birthday. Planning a day full of activities, inviting various guests of his and playing games, old and new - this was his thing.\n\nWe had gone through appetizers, the main course and the party was coming to an end. We were gearing up for the final activity of the evening before cutting the cake. The final event was always my choice. Dad would invite one of the new folks who had just moved into town and he would partake in a game of my choice. This was definitely the highlight of the evening! Often, I would change up the rules halfway through, prolong it as much as I could so the night didn\u2019t end and Dad would always comply.\n\nThere was a light knock on the door. This must be the new guest! I was ecstatic! I liked to pretend I hadn\u2019t thought about the game at all, but I had it all planned out in my head. Dad opened the door and let the guest in. As usual, there were protesters picketing outside the door. I never understood why they were there. Dad never let me outside, catering to all my needs in the house itself. But as I grew older, my curiosity was beginning to get the better of me. Dad must have sensed this in my face as he quickly shut the door and gave me a stern look.\n\n\"Alright buddy, what\u2019s it going to be?!\" he asked excitedly. \"I have a pot of boiling water ready if you want a repeat of last year? Or perhaps, we can use the freezing room?\"\n\nI waited a few moments. I loved the attention from all the guests, watching me, waiting for me to call the shots. The look of anticipation on their faces, the drama and tension of not knowing the game, the glee on my Dad\u2019s face - it was the highlight of the day, more so than the game itself.\n\n\"The 100 meter dash on burning coal.\" I said. Dad looked surprised, giving me a puzzling look.\n\n\"100 times. With lashes at the end of each run.\" I continued. The look quickly changed on my dad\u2019s face. \"That\u2019s my boy!\" he said and looked at all the guests with immense pride in his face.\n\nI turned to look as well. My moment had arrived. Pindrop silence with a look of shock and surprise on everyone\u2019s faces. Followed by thunderous applause and big smiles. My moment of glory was here. However, something felt different this time. Everyone was smiling, but their eyes look terrified. I looked around and everyone looked visibly scared. I turned my attention to the new guest who was going to play the game. He looked timid and horrified. What was different this time? Was it the game I chose?\n\nI was caught in a strange conflict. On the one hand, the 100 meter coal dash was one of my favorite games, but on the other, I was very puzzled with the lack of excitement on my guests\u2019 faces. Why were me and Dad the only ones truly enthused by the upcoming event? Was I just noticing this now or had this always been the case?\n\nThe game had begun. Dad took over from me. He heard my rules and was ready to lash on the new guest 100 times over as his feet burnt on red hot coal that he laid out in the living room. I, however, couldn\u2019t focus on the game at all. My eyes drifted towards the onlookers watching the game, with forced smiles on their faces. Were these people scared? Who were they scared of? My Dad? Me? Somehow, my attention was brought back to the protesters outside the house. What were they protesting about? I must find out.\n\nI watched, as the new guest finished one more lap, much slower than his last one. Dad was about to give out his lashings. This was the perfect opportunity for me to make a dash for the door. He completed the lap, I got out of Dad\u2019s vision and sprinted for the door. I opened it and saw the signs for the first time in my life - \"Stop the torture!\", \"We don\u2019t deserve this\", \"Satan must perish\".\n\nDad caught up to me in a jiffy. He pulled me inside with a look of rage I had never seen before. He slammed the door to a chorus of \"The Devil must Die!\" from the protesters. I knew I was going to be punished for this, but I could not care less at the time. Only thought came mind: \"Who am I?\"", "The Dark Reflection\n\nIn a world where morality was a luxury few could afford, Kael, a former soldier turned mercenary, found himself at odds with the infamous crime lord, Zarek. For years, Zarek had terrorized the city, using his wealth and influence to corrupt even the highest echelons of power. Kael had lost loved ones to Zarek's brutality and was determined to bring him to justice.\n\nAs the two enemies clashed in an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of the city, it became clear that Kael was outmatched. Zarek had assembled a private army of ruthless mercenaries, each with a personal vendetta against Kael. Despite the odds, Kael refused to back down.\n\nThe battle raged on for what seemed like hours, with Kael dodging and weaving between the mercenaries' attacks. Just as he began to gain ground, Zarek revealed his trump card: a young woman, Sarah, who had been kidnapped months ago. She was the daughter of a prominent businessman, and her family's fortune would be Zarek's for the taking if Kael refused to surrender.\n\nWith a heavy heart, Kael knew he had to act fast. He also knew that Zarek had one weakness \u2013 his insatiable arrogance. If Kael could exploit that, he might just stand a chance.\n\nIn a desperate bid to turn the tables, Kael did something that went against every fiber of his being. He dropped to his knees, adopting the pose of a defeated man. But it was all a ruse. As Zarek gloated, ordering his men to take Kael into custody, Kael subtly manipulated his restraints, secretly unraveling the binding on his wrists.\n\nSensing victory within his grasp, Zarek sneered at Kael, spat on him, and instructed his men to beat him senseless. But as the punches rained down on Kael, he used the chaos to quietly slip free of his restraints.\n\nZarek, blinded by his own hubris, couldn't see the storm brewing. Kael, fueled by rage and humiliation, began to fight back with every ounce of strength he had. This time, however, he didn't hold back. He utilized every dirty trick he had learned on the streets, exploiting the darkness within himself that he had long tried to suppress.\n\nIn a flurry of blows, Kael took down Zarek's henchmen one by one. When the dust settled, only two men stood facing each other: Kael, covered in blood and bruises, and Zarek, grasping for air.\n\n\"You're no better than me,\" Zarek gasped, as Kael closed in for the final strike.\n\n\"No, I'm worse,\" Kael growled, his fist connecting with Zarek's jaw. \"I'm the reflection of the darkness you've created.\"\n\nAs Zarek lay defeated, Kael realized that he had indeed stooped lower than his enemy. But in that moment, he didn't care. For the first time in years, he had finally found some semblance of peace.\n\nKael freed Sarah, handing her over to her tearfully grateful family. As the authorities closed in, Zarek's vast empire began to crumble. Though Kael knew that the darkness within him would never truly be extinguished, he had saved the city from one of its greatest scourges. And for now, that was all that mattered.\n\nThe years that followed were far from easy, but Kael eventually found redemption in his actions, learning to confront the demons he had unleashed and harnessing his darker side for the greater good. Though his reflection in the mirror still bore the scars of that fateful day, he knew that the hero he once thought he was had long since faded away. The new Kael, forged in the fire of conflict and tempered by the darkness within, was stronger \u2013 and more complicated.", "Tom was excited as he felt the wind blowing through his hair at top speed. This is what he was looking for all this time. The satisfaction he felt missing from his life while he blew out his candles last week. Fifty years old doesn't mean anything. It certainly doesn't mean that he can't enjoy life anymore, and he's definitely enjoying life with a brand new red convertible.\n\nTom had always lived so safely. He never even joined the football team in fear of a few scratches. Chess and glee had been much safer. No more, though, Tom had decided. His life was almost over, and there was still so much to explore, to experience. Tom wasn't going to let another 50 years roll by without some excitement.\n\nWith such a dull life, however, Tom had never driven such a fast car at such fast speeds. He ignored this fact as he drove fast around corners in the open hillside. Tom ignored the sign cautioning a modest 40 miles per hour around the next bend. He began feeling the control of the car losing him as he compensated by slowly moving into the next lane. His heart beating fast, but a smile on his face. What Tom didn't see was the other car making its way in the opposite direction.\n\nTom didn't know what happened next. He never even saw the other car coming. Tom only remembered waking up several yards from his car. His car along with another, totaled. Without thinking, Tom gets up and rushes over. In the other car lay a battered and bruised kid. Someone in their 20s. The kid was motionless and bloody. Tom just knew the worst must have happened.\n\nWeeks had gone by. Tom still remembers what happened, how he got out without a scratch while some innocent kid had his life taken from him. Tom even went to the funeral, although he didn't tell anyone how he knew the deceased. No charges were pressed, but he almost wished they had been. He didn't deserve to be the one to walk away after being so reckless.\n\nShortly after the funeral, while his wife was asleep, Tom snuck into his basement. An old gun in his hand, a revolver. It was passed down by his grandfather. A single bullet in his hand. Tom sat down, took a good look at the gun, and loaded the bullet in. He wasn't sure if he wanted to die. He even began doubting if he deserved to die, as he had been feeling the last few weeks. An uneasy tear rolled down his cheek as he spun the barrel of the gun. The clicking of the gun came to a slow crawl before stopping. Every single click echoing in the poorly lit basement.\n\nTom's hand shaking, he slowly held the gun to his temple. Questioning if he really wanted to do this, he began remembering there was just one bullet. Just one chance. Perhaps he'll pull the trigger, nothing will happen, and he'll walk away. Forget anything ever happened, and that fate chose for him to stay alive. Tom's shaking began to worsen before he decided to just pull the trigger.\n\nTom woke up to screams from his wife. She was holding onto him, asking him if everything was alright. She had heard the gunshot, and came downstairs to find Tom laying on the floor beside a gun. Tom was still in a haze as he touched the side of his head where the gun had been. He felt some burned hair around the area, but no hole. Looking at his hand afterward, there was no blood, either. Tom hugged his wife, appreciating his life much more than he had ever before. He told his wife that he had set off the gun by accident without realizing there was a bullet inside.\n\nTom had realized something amazing that night. The question that had been bothering him for so long. Why had he lived, and someone else died? Tom performed a few more experiments, just to be sure. He had become certain, though, that he could not be hurt. Nothing scratched him, hurt him, or even broke his bones. He had survived, because all along, he was special.\n\nTom decided that he owed the young child something in return for his mistake. The child's death, after all, was caused by Tom trying to find reason and excitement in his life. In Tom's misguided journey to fulfill some sense of purpose, he had taken a life. It was time that he made up for this, and did good with his newfound abilities. Late at night, when his wife was asleep, he would sneak off and become an avenger for the people. Stopping criminals taking advantage of the good. This is how Tom made amends.", "The Typewriter of Fate\n\nI still remember the day I stumbled upon the antique typewriter in the dusty backroom of the vintage shop. The store owner, an eccentric old man with wispy white hair, had warned me about its supposed \"curse.\" I had dismissed his warnings as mere fantasy, but now, as I sat in my small writing studio, fingers poised over the keys, I felt a shiver run down my spine.\n\nIt started innocently enough. I typed \"The sun is shining brightly today,\" and, to my amazement, the sunlight streaming through the window seemed to intensify, bathing the room in a warm, golden glow. I wrote \"The coffee is freshly brewed,\" and, suddenly, the aroma of freshly ground coffee beans wafted from the kitchen, where the coffee maker had somehow magically turned itself on.\n\nExcitement and a dash of fear took hold as I realized the immense power at my fingertips. I began to type with purpose, creating a world that was equal parts fantasy and reality. \"The bookshelves are now filled with classic novels,\" I typed, and, voil\u00e0! The shelves, previously bare, were suddenly lined with leather-bound tomes, their gold lettering glinting in the sunlight.\n\nMy thoughts turned to my struggling artist friend, Emma, who was fighting to make ends meet. I typed \"Emma's paintings are now featured in a prestigious gallery,\" and, the next day, she called me in tears, explaining that a prominent art dealer had just offered her a solo show.\n\nAs the days passed, my typewriter wielded an unbridled influence on the world. I typed \"The traffic in the city is flowing smoothly,\" and, to my wonder, the usually congested streets cleared, allowing people to reach their destinations with ease. I wrote \"The homeless shelter is now fully funded,\" and, suddenly, donations poured in from anonymous benefactors.\n\nBut with great power comes great responsibility, and I soon realized the weight of my new role. Every decision, every word, had the potential to reshape reality. The burden of accountability settled upon me, and I began to approach each sentence with caution, weighing the consequences of my actions.\n\nAs news of my typewriter spread, people began to seek me out, asking for solutions to their problems. A young couple, desperate to start a family, begged me to type \"They are now pregnant with a healthy child.\" I hesitated, aware of the potential risks, but my heart went out to them. I typed the words, and, nine months later, they welcomed a beautiful baby into their family.\n\nHowever, not all my attempts were successful. I typed \"The wars have ceased, and world peace has been achieved,\" but the conflicting interests of nations and the complexity of human nature proved too great for even my typewriter's magic to overcome.\n\nOne fateful night, as I pondered the responsibilities of my craft, I realized that the true power of the typewriter lay not in its ability to shape reality but in the power of my own imagination. I typed \"The world is a better place when we use our talents to uplift one another,\" and, in that instant, a sense of unity and cooperation seemed to spread across the globe.\n\nFrom that day forward, I used my typewriter to inspire, to motivate, and to encourage others to tap into their own potential for good. The world was still imperfect, but my writing became a beacon of hope, shining a light on the possibility of a brighter future.\n\nAnd so, I continue to type, my fingers dancing across the keys, my words crafting a reality where love, kindness, and understanding can flourish.", "The cool mountain air carried the scent of danger. Thand breathed deeply of the rich scent of the forest. He was alone, a rare privilege these days. As the scion of one of the five Xopa houses, and highest ranking Xopa commander in the Imperial army, his soldiers and servants always surrounded him. He knew some of the humans under his command mocked him for keeping to the old ways of his people. He snorted to himself as he thought of the puny humans and their torches, horses, guns, and dogs. No, the true test of the warrior was to face the darkness alone.\n\nAlone in the dark, Thand drew strength from the forest. Some of the Xopa raiders captured earlier that day had cursed him as a rastilneta, the slur free Xopa used to describe their brethren who had joined the empire. Let those starving wretches call him a potted plant when he hunted alone tonight with only his blade, he thought to himself.\n\nSomewhere in the darkness ahead, under the cold light of the moon, a panther screamed. Thand's blood chilled at the sound as he instinctively moved toward it. His prey was a predator herself, and he silently congratulated her on her kill. He prayed to be so lucky when he would find her. His eyes were already adjusting to the darkness, and his other senses conveyed so much more of what the woods would say. He pitied his human comrades who would never know the secrets of the forest.\n\nDespite Thand's heightened senses, it was the whistling that alerted him to their presence. He instinctively dropped into the fighting stance taught to him by his teachers. As the son of a sinjoro, he had of course been taught to fight in the Imperial style, although his father had demanded that he and his brothers learn the old ways as well. The result had been a very peculiar blend of old and new that made Thand one of the most formidable fighters in the empire.\n\nThe whistling intensified as a dozen Xopa warriors emerged from the trees in a rough circle around him. In the darkness their chestnut skin and rich green braids blended well with the woods.\n\nLook, a lost little rastilneta one mocked him.\n\nAll alone without any men or guns to protect him another said.\n\nThe speech of the Xopa sounded like the rustle of the wind through leaves, and carried the unmistakable lilt of laughter. Stepping forward into the clearing, Thand could see that they were lean, wiry and ropy, despite being nearly nine feet tall. They were naked except for loincloths, although the leader was wearing a pouched vest as well. Their simple costumes were in sharp contrast to Thand's attire.\n\nDressed in the blue and butternut of the Imperial Army of Ortinia, with his brown leather boots, Thand looked ridiculous. As Xopa were almost one and a half times the size of a man, his tunic and pants were large and loose. At his hip he reached reflexively for his holster, only to remember that he had left it behind. The only weapon he had with him was his traditional scimitar.\n\nAre you ready to die, rastilneta? another taunted him, as the circle feinted in and out around him.\n\nThand stoop up, revealing his impressive ten-foot height. \"I am Thandizwe sin Arakwe. My father was Galza sin Arakwe. His father was Syabu Doxar sin Arakwe. I can trace my ancestry back to Mizuxi himself. You are nothing but bandits and beggars,\" he said with a well-earned arrogance. He undid the brass buttons and shrugged off his tunic.\n\nThe moonlight revealed his beautiful, scarred body. There were marks from the fights his father had demanded of him, from the duels he had fought on his long rise to power, and from his many battles for the Ortinians. He hefted the sabre as he stared at the leader.\n\n\"This blade was made in the old way, from the stinger of the giant daggerwasp. I killed the queen and drank her dream honey myself. I blooded this blade when I was but eight summers old, on raider scum just like you,\" Thand growled. His eyes flicked from warrior to warrior. Thand knew he was outnumbered twelve to one. He had to draw them in.\n\n\"When I kill you, I will burn your bodies. I will throw the ashes into the great salt. Your seed will shrivel up and die. Your spirits will be condemned to howl in the wastes for all eternity.\" This last insult finally proved too much and one warrior charged him with a fierce cry.\n\nThand's scimitar met his attacker in the throat, spilling his rich sweet blood on the pine needles. As the warrior's momentum carried him forward, Thand buried his blade in the xopa's back. The warrior's lifeless body collapsed to the floor. A new respect appeared in the eyes of the leader and the older veterans. A growing fear warred behind the eyes of some of the younger warriors. Another charged Thand from the side.\n\nThand dropped his shoulder and flipped the charging warrior into the air. With a fearsome upward slash, he was coated in the blood of the warrior. His opponent was dead before he hit the ground. Thandize we, covered in blood, heard the ritual song of his ancestors on the wind. The blood lust was on him. He turned and eyed the smallest warrior. His markings were the same as the leader. Ahh, thought Thand, and here is where his weakness will lie. \"Shall I kill your seedling in front of you?\" he challenged the leader.\n\nThe leader's face became a mask of rage as he ordered, KILL HIM\n\nThe circle closed on Thand. Ostris and knives flashed in the darkness in the cold light of the moon. For every wound Thand received he gave two. He repeated his mantra again and again. \"I AM THANDIZWE SIN ARAKWE.\" Slash, stab. \"I AM THE BLOOD OF MIZUXI.\" Parry, thrust. When one warrior stabbed his sword in Thand's back he grunted and eviscerated the fool with his blade when the warrior struggled to pull it out. Another struck him in the chest before Thand's blade cut him down. He bled from two dozen wounds as the soft ground soaked up the hot blood of eleven Xopa.\n\nThand staggered around like a wounded bull, slashing and parrying with his blade as he cut them down. \"I AM THANDIZWE SIN ARAKWE.\" Another warrior fell. \"I AM THE BLOOD OF MIZUXI\". A Xopa warrior uttered a guttural scream as he was disembowled. \"I AM THANDIZWE SIN ARAKWE.\" The leader's blade came up feebly. \"I AM THE BLOOD OF MIZUXI.\" The leader's lifeless green eyes stared at nothing as his disembodied head rolled away from his corpse. Thand fell to one knee, half wresting on his scimitar for support. No fewer than six blades had been broken on his body. Ahead of him was only the seedling, who held his blade in front of him with both trembling hands.\n\n\"Come, little weed. Come and fight me. Blood your sword on the blood of Mizuxi himself.\" The seedling took a step backwards. Even mortally wounded, Thand was a terrifying sight. Thand took pity on the young warrior. Barely seven feet tall, he surely could not be much older than his tenth summer.\n\n\"This will be the song they will sing of you. You will be the one who killed Thandizwe sin Arakwe.\" He cajoled the boy. \"All you must do is strike me down. Give me the Warrior's death.\"\n\nThe seedling took a tentative step forward, almost running when Thand raised his curved sword. \"NO!\" Thand barked, \"You must earn my blood, little weed. Become a warrior today, and strike me down, or I will kill you myself and burn your body.\" The boy's eyes hardened and he nodded. He lunged at Thand, who parried his inexpert thrust easily.\n\n\"Pathetic\" he laughed, as the seedling picked himself up. \"I will cut your hand off if you try something that foolish again.\" Thand coughed up some more blood. \"Do it quickly boy, or I will die with your blade unblooded.\" The seedling charged again, and Thand rewarded him with a slash across the face.\n\nThe seedling howled as the blood rushed through his fingers. Thand roared up at the sky, \"I have bled you. I have killed your clansmen. I have killed your FATHER. NOW will you kill me? Or are you too much of a cow-URK\" Thand looked down at the blade emerging from his chest. Thandizwe looked over his shoulder at the bloody seedling who had run him through. Thandizwe grinned at him. \"Your blade has taken this life,\" his chest heaved as blood bubbled a the corners of his mouth, \"Little warrior. Now I will show you. A true. Xopa.\"\n\nThe youth stood in shock as Thandizwe sin Arakwe fell forward with a thud. He pulled his sword from the corpse and turned to look for his father. His father's head was laying on its side some distance from its body. The warrior picked it up and kissed its forehead before closing his father's eyes. He dragged all dozen bodies to the base of a dozen trees, giving honor to all the warriors who had fallen in this battle in the wood. The sun was coming up by the time he was finished. He collected his prizes, the boots and jacket of Thandizwe, his father's vest, the pouches of all the warriors, but left their weapons for the journey to the Beyond. The young warrior then began the long lonely trek back to his village.", "As a child, I would often sit on the couch in my grandparents' living room, listening intently as they bickered back and forth in their native tongue. Their words would flow like a rapid-fire dance, with my grandfather's booming laughter punctuating the air. To me, it was just a pleasant background hum, a symphony of sounds that filled me with warmth and comfort. But as I grew older, I started to feel like an outsider, not understanding the language that had been part of my grandparents' lives for so long.\n\nSo, I made a decision: I would take language lessons. I found a tutor, Mrs. Patel, who was patient and kind, and began to learn the intricacies of my grandparents' native language, Gujarati.\n\nIt wasn't easy, of course. The sounds, the cadence, the grammar \u2013 everything was so different from English. But I was determined to master it, to be able to join in on those lively conversations, to surprise my grandparents with my newfound skills.\n\nWeeks turned into months, and months turned into years. I practiced every day, listening to podcasts, watching Gujarati movies, and speaking with Mrs. Patel. And slowly but surely, the language began to take shape in my mind.\n\nThe day finally arrived when I felt confident enough to surprise my grandparents. I walked into their living room, beaming with pride, and cleared my throat to get their attention.\n\n\"\u0ab9\u0ac7\u0ab2\u0acb, \u0aae\u0abe\u0ab0\u0abe \u0aa6\u0abe\u0aa6\u0abe \u0aa6\u0abe\u0aa6\u0ac0!\" I said, trying to sound nonchalant. (\"Hello, Grandma and Grandpa!\")\n\nThey looked up at me, startled, and then their faces broke into wide grins. \"\u0a86\u0aad\u0abe\u0ab0\u0acd\u0aaf, \u0aac\u0ac7\u0a9f\u0ac1\u0a82!\" they exclaimed, showering me with hugs and kisses. (\"Well done, child!\")\n\nI had expected some degree of surprise and delight, but nothing could have prepared me for what came next. As we sat down to dinner, I listened intently as my grandparents began to talk shorthand, switched between English and Gujarati.\n\nAt first, it was exhilarating to understand the language, to be able to follow their conversations. But as the night wore on, I began to realize that my grandparents' playful bickering had been a carefully constructed fa\u00e7ade. Behind the smiles and laughter, they had been discussing some rather more serious topics: disagreements over my parents' decisions, concerns about my career choices, and worries about their own mortality.\n\nTheir words, once music to my ears, now stung like a slap in the face. I felt like I had been living in a bubble, blissfully unaware of the complexities of their relationship. The lightness, the playfulness \u2013 it was all an act, a way to shield me from the truth.\n\nI didn't know how to process this new understanding. Part of me felt ashamed for not understanding sooner, for thinking that their relationship was so carefree. Another part of me felt a deep empathy for my grandparents, for the sacrifices they had made, the difficulties they had faced.\n\nAs I drove back home that night, I couldn't help but wonder: did I really want to know the truth? Would I have been better off staying in the dark, preserved in my naivety? The answer, I realized, was no. Knowledge, however painful, was power. And I was determined to use this newfound understanding to deepen my connection with my grandparents, to be a source of comfort and support in their golden years.\n\nAs I looked in the rearview mirror, I saw a faint smile spreading across my face. I had gained something that night, something far more valuable than a language: a glimpse into the complexities of the human heart, and a newfound appreciation for the intricate web of relationships that bound us all together.", "\"I've lived for eons, seen civilizations rise and fall like the tides. Watched as humanity took its first wobbly steps on the moon, and as empires expanded and contracted like the beating of a restless heart. I've walked among kings and queens, been toasted by bards and Wo scampered through forests with wild creatures. And yet, as the weight of my endless years presses down upon me, I find myself yearning for the one thing that's always eluded me: mortality.\"\n\nI sat in the dimly lit tavern, nursing a cup of dusty wine as I spoke to the young woman across from me. Her eyes sparkled with curiosity, and I couldn't help but notice the fire that burned within her. A passion that would one day dwindle, as all things must.\n\n\"You don't understand,\" I said, the words spilling forth in a mixture of desperation and pleading. \"Immortality is not the blessing it seems. Oh, at first, it's exhilarating \u2013 the world is your playground, and you can do as you please. But the years build up, like sediment at the bottom of a river. You watch as friends, loved ones, and entire nations come and go, leaving you behind, stuck in the mire of time.\"\n\nI paused, collecting my thoughts as the memories flooded my mind. \"I've seen it all, and yet, I've seen nothing at all. I've been a soldier, a poet, a scientist, and a king. But each persona wears thin after a while, and the weariness of living another day, month, year, becomes suffocating. The excitement of discovery gives way to familiarity's dull ache. You begin to crave something more, something that'll finally bring an end to the never-ending cycle.\"\n\nThe young woman leaned in, her eyes filled with empathy. \"And that's what you yearn for? Death?\"\n\nI smiled wistfully. \"Not just death. But a sense of finality. To be free from the exhaustion of living, to let go of the weight of memory, to surrender to the mystery of the unknown. For so long, I've held on to this existence, convinced that something, anything, would change. That I'd find meaning in this endless expanse. But it's a cruel joke, played on an immortal heart.\"\n\nWe sat in silence for a moment, the fire crackling between us. I could feel the warmth of her understanding, but I knew I couldn't expect her to truly comprehend the weight of my immortal existence.\n\n\"I've lived through wars and famines, disease and despair,\" I continued, my voice barely above a whisper. \"And through it all, the world changes, but I remain the same. Frozen in time, while the river of humanity flows on, carrying with it all that's new and vibrant. I yearn to be part of that flow, to dip my toes into the ocean, to be brought low by the waves of life.\"\n\nAs I finished speaking, a fragile smile spread across my face. \"Death would be a release, a welcome reprieve from the Promethean weight of eternal life. A chance to lay down the burden of memory, to cease being an observer and become part of the fabric of time.\"\n\nThe young woman nodded, and I could see tears glistening in her eyes. For a fleeting moment, we shared a connection, a bond formed by the vice of experience.\n\n\"Thank you,\" I whispered, my voice trembling. \"Thank you for listening, for trying to understand.\"\n\nWith a deep breath, I extinguished the candle that flickered on the table, letting the darkness envelop me like a shroud.", "The Doorbell rang. Finally the pizza was here. My friends and I had been drinking since clocking off at 5pm after working 8 hours hard labour for the same arsehole of a boss, and now 6 hours later we were all feeling the need for food. Fred got up and staggered drunkenly down the hallway to the door kicking over a few empty beer bottles on his way. The rest of us, myself, Charlie and Rob, sat around trying to decide what show to binge on netflix next.\n\n\"Uh lads?\" he shouted from the door \"This guy says he needs \u00a3300. How much did you all order?\" Me and the others looked around at each other puzzled. We'd only ordered two large ones, how could they come to \u00a3300? They must have gotten the order wrong so I went to join Fred out in the hallway and get this cleared up. At this point I was hungry and drunk and really couldn't be arsed with an argument right now. The man who stood at the door definitely wasn't the pizza guy. For start he wasn't some spotty teen but a guy around six feet tall wearing an ankle length black leather jacket and a cowboy hat.\n\n\"Look stop messing me around\" The guy says \"I got a call about an order and now I'm here to deliver. Now I'm gonna need paying or I'm gonna have to take something from one of you worth more than \u00a3300\" Fred burst out laughing while I was still pretty confused by the whole situation (The 9 or so pints of beer I'd already had weren't helping much)\n\"C'mon\" Fred slurred \"Who put you up to this? Was it Charlie? Charlie! You dickhead, is this you?\"\n\nBy this point the cowboy at my front door started getting irate. He pushed my and Fred backwards towards the living room and shoved us hard onto the unoccupied sofa. \"Look you little Shits\" He snarled at us \"I've been called up to carry out a job and I'm not ready to have my time dicked around by a bunch of drunken idiots. Now you're gonna tell me who I'm hitting, hand over the \u00a3300 and I'll be on my way\"\n\nFinally the penny dropped in each of us and we realised what this guy was. My friends and I looked around at each other, mouths agape. There was only one way out of this mess and so rarely does an opportunity like this come along. So. Who did we want to kill the most?", "Our watch-captain had called for sights of land an hour ago, and as I now breached the hangar and into the fresh of air, I was hit by a disgusting stench. All around me my crew mates had gas masks, shirt tails, any thing to block the smell. I too pulled up mine, and checked my RistRatch for the current radiation levels.\n\n\"Bless the Three-Armed Queen, Radcliffe look, radiation is through the charts here!\" I cried, and soon my right hand man was at my left.\n\nRadcliffe was certainly as astonished as I was at these records levels, but we decided to press on, the world needed to know what became of this once great nation. And so at landfall Radcliffe, a hired gun, and I departed the ship and walked across the perilous ruins of the Eastern Seaboard.\n\nJournals in hand, Radcliffe and I took all afternoon documenting, billing, declaring, and constituting all information we could about this new world. Buildings had crumbled, roads were halfway to being just piles of gravel (though Radcliffe told me they were always like that). There was some life, much to our joy, neon green plants had exploded out of the ground, with metre high tendrils. A few hours in, a rodent, with a tint of violet in it's fur, skittered across a vacant lawn. I slammed the button on my RistRatch in time, and the poor creature brought up high radiation and a 76% mutation. We spent a good time documenting that, actual mammal life!\n\nThe day was thinning, and determined to get back before night, we were just turning back when the most extraordinary sight befell us. We stood on a battered sidewalk, and in a diagonal line across the road, was a creature of our high. It appeared full and bulbous, bipedal, and staggering. It's skin was a sickly pale white, and tufts of grey hour sprouted everywhere.\n\n\"Radcliffe, by the Queen, what is that thing?\"\n\nI thought I had whispered, but the creature turned and bore it's grotesque face. Drooping guys, a wide mouth with crooked teeth. It didn't look unlike a human size version of the rodent before! It's back was hunched, and upon my whispering, it shouted a garbled language I could only get fragments of.\n\n\" GITAAAAHT OO ALEEENS\"\n\nWe were terrified, I turned to the hired gun we had, but he had sprinted away, while me and Radcliffe were frozen in place. I begged again.\n\n\"Radcliffe what is that thing!?\"\n\nHis fingers were a blur on his RistRatch, and he turned to me with a shocked complexion.\n\n\"Daniel, that thing, that's not mutated, absolute 0%!\" he choked. We turned back to beast, as it began it's crooked charge towards us.\n\n\"It's a monster!\" I shouted, and I closed my eyes and accepted my fate. But my fate was not today. A buckshot rang across my ears, leaving only a ringing. The hired gun! He came back!\n\nMe and Radcliffe both turned to thank our mercenary, but what we were greeted by was shocking.\n\nA tall man stood, wearing straps and jackets of leather. His dark skin reflected the wavering light of the dying sun. His massive sawed-off shotgun wore a large American flag off the side, and his posse behind him had guns with the same decorations. He stepped forward to the downed beast as he stuck a lit blunt in his mouth.\n\n\"Not a monster,\" he spoke roughly, as he raised a pair of sunglasses to his eyes. He turned to me, his bald head and large ears silhouetted in the sunset. \"Just another Republican.\"", "The Long Wait\n\nCommodore Sarah Jenkins stood on the quarterdeck of her flagship, the HMS _Defender_, her eyes fixed on the horizon where the enemy ship, the _Le Fant\u00f4me_, awaited. The two vessels were poised in a stalemate, their crews bracing for the inevitable exchange of fire. But this was no ordinary naval battle. The distance between the two ships was so vast that the shots they were about to exchange would take hours to reach their target.\n\nThe _Defender_ was a behemoth of a ship, with three masts and a hull studded with cannon. _Le Fant\u00f4me_, on the other hand, was a sleek, black-hulled frigate, with a reputation for speed and cunning. Jenkins knew that her opponent, Captain Henri LaFleur, was a master of naval warfare, and she expected no quarter.\n\n\"Fire at will, Mr. Thompson,\" Jenkins ordered, her voice steady and calm.\n\nThe _Defender_'s gun crews sprang into action, loading and aiming the cannons with precision. The ship shuddered and boomed as the first broadside was loosed, the cannonballs soaring into the sky like black, heavy birds. _Le Fant\u00f4me_ responded in kind, its own cannons erupting in a chorus of fire and smoke.\n\nBut as the crews cheered and the officers watched with bated breath, they knew that their missiles would take hours to reach their mark. The vast expanse of ocean between the two ships stretched out like an unforgiving abyss, the cannonballs merely a tiny, disappearing speck on the horizon.\n\nAs the hours ticked by, the tension on both ships grew. Crews checked and rechecked their cannons, making minute adjustments to aim and elevation. Officers pored over charts and tables, calculating trajectories and air resistance. Jenkins and LaFleur engaged in a game of cat and mouse, each trying to outmaneuver the other, even as their ships remained static, suspended in a tableau of anticipation.\n\nThe wait was agonizing. The sun beat down on the decks, relentless in its ferocity. Sailors fidgeted, checked their watches for what felt like the hundredth time, and whispered nervous predictions to one another. On _Le Fant\u00f4me_, LaFleur paced the quarterdeck, his eyes fixed on the British ship, his mind racing with calculations and counterstrategies.\n\nFinally, after what felt like an eternity, the first cannonball struck the water, sending up a mighty plume of spray and foam. _Defender_'s lookouts cheered as the ball splashed down, but their excitement was short-lived. The missile had fallen short, plunging into the ocean with a defeated splash.\n\nThe silence that followed was oppressive. Both crews held their breath, waiting for the inevitable barrage of cannonballs that would soon follow. Jenkins and LaFleur exchanged glances across the distance, each knowing that the outcome of this slow-motion battle would depend on the accuracy of their gun crews, and the whims of fate.\n\nThe hours ticked on, each one stretching out like a thin, taut thread. The ships remained locked in their standoff, the ocean stretching out before them like an empty, expectant stage. And then, without warning, the cannons spoke again, their thunderous roar echoing across the waves as the battle finally, slowly, reached its climax.", "Its been a long time Saladin but its time, i knew it would end like this after i made my first wish, omniscience is a pain like that, only it was what i had needed at a time, though my first wish i realized my second wish, my first made me realize there was no god and only a single universe, i fixed that in my second, allowing all possible actions and choices to spawn a separate universe, meaning all possible wishes i could make were granted to at least one version of me. Of course this also meant that my last wish was essentially worthless, with all potential actions being taken and with all knowledge already in my possession i had no goals anymore, nothing to do, and nowhere to go, i though i could block it out with human interaction, but every conversation every single action i took had been done by me or would be done by me.\n\nIt took me a long time to realize, but i still had one wish left, of course i had everything in existence, but what of outside of existence, there is a chance my omniscience does not work there, and with nothing better to do I'm going to take it.", "Eight Months of Hell\n\nI trudged through the desolate city streets, my eyes scanning the horizon for any sign of danger. Eight months had passed since the zombie apocalypse ravaged the world, leaving only a few scattered groups of survivors in its wake. My group, a motley crew of roughnecks, had become my family in this harsh new world. We had formed an uneasy alliance, bound together by our determination to survive.\n\nAs we navigated the ruins of a once-thriving metropolis, our leader, Grizz, a gruff but fair man, called out to us to halt. We had arrived at a promising location \u2013 a abandoned pharmacy, which might yield some much-needed medical supplies. I took point, my rifle at the ready, as we swept the area for any signs of trouble.\n\nThat's when I saw him.\n\nStanding amidst the rubble, a scavenger stood frozen, a mixture of fear and desperation etched on his face. His eyes, however, sparkled with recognition as our gazes met. My heart skipped a beat. It was Alex, my best friend since college.\n\nFor a moment, I forgot about the zombies, forgot about the dangers that lurked in every shadow. All I saw was the familiar face, the charming smile, and the warmth that radiated from his presence.\n\n\"Alex?\" I whispered, my voice trembling.\n\nHis eyes darted to the rifle in my hands, and he instinctively raised his own, a handgun clutched in his shaking hand.\n\n\"Please, don't shoot!\" he begged, his voice cracking.\n\nBut I knew it was too late.\n\nGrizz stepped forward, his face a mask of suspicion. \"Who is this?\" he growled, eyeing Alex's gun.\n\nI took a step forward, trying to intervene. \"Wait, he's my friend \u2013\"\n\nGrizz cut me off, his voice cold. \"Friend or not, he's armed and a potential threat. We can't take the risk.\"\n\nI felt a chill run down my spine as the rest of the group nodded in agreement. Alex, sensing the tension, took a step back, his eyes wide with terror.\n\n\"Please, don't do this,\" I implored, but my words fell on deaf ears.\n\nOne of the crew members, a burly man named Hank, raised his rifle, taking aim at Alex. My heart was racing, my mind screaming in protest.\n\nWith a heavy heart, I realized I had to make a choice \u2013 stand by my crew or save my friend. I took a deep breath and put my hand out, palm facing Hank's rifle.\n\n\"Hold up,\" I said, trying to keep my voice steady.\n\nFor a moment, the group hesitated, expecting Grizz to override me. But I stood my ground, my eyes locked on Alex's pleading face.\n\n\"We don't know what he's been through,\" I argued, trying to reason with them. \"We can't just execute him like a fugitive.\"\n\nGrizz's expression softened, and he turned to me, a curious glint in his eye. \"What are you proposing, Jax?\"\n\nI took a deep breath and pulled out a small notebook and a pen from my backpack. \"We make him prove himself,\" I said, scribbling a challenge. \"He's got skills, resourcefulness \u2013 we can use that to our advantage.\"\n\nI handed the notebook to Grizz, who pondered the proposal before nodding.\n\n\"Alright, we give him a chance. If he proves himself, he joins us. If he betrays us, he's out.\"\n\nAlex, still wary, hesitantly lowered his gun. I let out a sigh of relief as Grizz gestured for him to join us.\n\nAs we began to scour the pharmacy for supplies, I couldn't help but feel a mix of emotions. I was overjoyed to have my friend back, but a part of me knew that this was just the beginning of a whole new set of challenges \u2013 ones that would test our loyalty, our trust, and our very humanity.", "I sat at my desk, sipping on a lukewarm cup of coffee, my eyes scanning the endless stream of writing prompts on my screen. As a writer, I had lost count of the number of hours I'd spent browsing through r/WritingPrompts, searching for that elusive spark of inspiration that would set my creative juices flowing. And then, I saw it.\n\n\"You are scrolling through r/WritingPrompts, when this very prompt catches your attention. Intrigued by its meta nature, you debate with yourself whether or not you'll write about it.\"\n\nI raised an eyebrow, a wry smile spreading across my face. How delightfully self-referential. It was as if the prompt was winking at me, daring me to bite. I hesitated, my mind racing with the possibilities.\n\nShould I write about this? Would it be some kind of meta-commentary on the nature of writing prompts and online communities? Or would it simply be a self-indulgent exercise in navel-gazing? I weighed the pros and cons, my fingers drumming against the keyboard as I deliberated.\n\nBut as I read the prompt again, I felt a thrill of excitement. What if I took this prompt and ran with it? What if I wrote a story about a writer writing a story about a writer writing a story...? The possibilities spiraled out before me like a matryoshka doll of infinite recursion.\n\nI took a deep breath, my fingers flying across the keyboard as I began to write. I wrote about myself, a writer scrolling through r/WritingPrompts, hesitant to take on the challenge. I wrote about my doubts and fears, about the uncertainty of creating something worthy.\n\nAs I wrote, the words flowed effortlessly, like water pouring down a stream. I wrote about the prompt itself, about how it seemed to mirror the very act of writing. I wrote about the watching, waiting, and wondering that accompanied the creative process.\n\nAnd then, as I typed the final sentence, I realized that I had created something unexpected \u2013 a story that was both about itself and about the act of writing itself. I smiled, a sense of satisfaction spreading through me.\n\nI had debated with myself, and in the end, I'd decided to write about it. Now, the question was: would anyone else find it as fascinating as I did? I hesitated for a moment, then clicked the \"submit\" button, sending my story out into the unknown.\n\nThe waiting game had begun.", "\"Are you buying that or what?\" Emily asked, raising an eyebrow as she examined the vintage typewriter on the dusty antique shop shelf.\n\nHer friend, Jack, a self-proclaimed collector of all things quirky, held up his hands in defense. \"Hey, hear me out. This baby's a 1920s Remington Noiseless Portable. It's a piece of history!\"\n\nEmily chuckled. \"A piece of history that looks like it hasn't been used since the Roaring Twenties. What are you going to do with it?\"\n\nJack's eyes sparkled. \"I'm going to restore it to its former glory, of course! And then, I'm going to write the Great American Novel on it.\"\n\nEmily laughed. \"You're going to write a novel on a typewriter that's older than our grandparents?\"\n\nJack grinned. \"Why not? I've always been fascinated by the writers of old. Hemingway, Fitzgerald, they all used these things to create their masterpieces. I'm convinced that using this typewriter will tap me into their creative energies.\"\n\nThe shop owner, an elderly man with thick glasses, peeked out from behind the counter. \"You know, that typewriter has been on that shelf for years. I've had offers, but I've been waiting for the right person to come along. You, my friend,\" he said, nodding at Jack, \"seem like the right person.\"\n\nEmily rolled her eyes good-naturedly. \"You're not exactly selling Jack on the practicalities of owning a vintage typewriter, are you?\"\n\nThe shop owner winked. \"No, my dear. Some things are worth more than their practical value. This typewriter has stories to tell. And I have a feeling Jack here is the one to coax them out.\"\n\nAs they left the shop, Emily turned to Jack and asked, \"You're really serious about this, aren't you?\"\n\nJack nodded, cradling the typewriter in his arms. \"Dead serious. I can feel it \u2013 the weight of history, the promise of creativity. This typewriter is going to change my life.\"\n\nEmily smiled, a hint of doubt lingering on her lips. But as they stepped out into the bright sunlight, she caught a glimpse of the excitement in Jack's eyes, and she began to wonder \u2013 maybe this old typewriter was more than just a quirk. Maybe it was the start of something remarkable.", "The Loop of Fate\n\nI've lost count of how many times I've died. Each time, I've been spat back to the moment that set my demise in motion. The memories of those events are etched in my mind like scars on a worn-out canvas. But nothing could have prepared me for the day I was hit by a car.\n\nI was 29, living a mundane life in the city, working a 9-to-5 job and barely making ends meet. The fateful day started like any other, with me crossing the street, lost in thought. The screeching tires and crushing pain were the last things I remembered.\n\nAnd then, I was 17 again.\n\nThe year was 2009, and I found myself standing in front of my childhood home, surrounded by the familiar sights and smells of my youth. My mind was reeling, trying to make sense of the chaos that had brought me here. I stumbled through the front door, slamming it shut behind me.\n\nMy mother's concerned voice greeted me. \"Hey, sweetie! Where have you been? You're supposed to be studying for your exams.\"\n\nStudying. Exams. I had forgotten what those felt like. My gaze fell upon the newspaper clipping on the fridge, announcing the rivalry between our high school and the neighboring town's team in the upcoming football game.\n\nIt dawned on me then \u2013 the car accident wasn't just a random event. It was connected to that rivalry, 12 years ago. I recalled a heated argument between my best friend, Jake, and the rival team's star quarterback, Ethan, at the after-party that night.\n\nThe thread of causality unwound before me like a twisted yarn. If I could prevent that fight, would I change the course of events? Would I live?\n\nFor the next few weeks, I worked tirelessly to redirect the trajectory of events. I warned Jake about the dangers of Ethan's temper and convinced him to avoid confrontation. At the fateful party, I busied myself, strategically placing myself between my friends to prevent any clashes.\n\nThe kids were puzzled by my behavior, but my parents chalked it up to teenage paranoia.\n\nThe night of the party passed without incident.\n\nAnd still, I woke up in a world unfamiliar to me.\n\nThis time, I was 31, a journalist covering a devastating factory fire in an impoverished town. My body bore the scars of smoke and heat. I knew then that my repeated attempts to alter the timeline had only succeeded in weaving a different thread in the tapestry of fate.\n\nEach iteration brought me closer to unraveling the truth: that my demise was connected to an unassuming traffic accident, the outcome of a conflict between my hometown and a long-forgotten rival school. It seemed the Fates had seen fit to twine our destinies, like an abstract singularity.\n\nTime passed, yet time stood still. In my pursuit of self-preservation, I gained an unhealthy obsession with tracing the threads of causality, ever unfolding a nascent paw of reality. Each new iteration bridged a gap between events, weaving a labyrinth of relationship networks that obfuscated the root cause.\n\nDid changing the past guarantee redemption?

Or so I thought. As I rolled out of bed and began my morning routine, I had no idea that the next 12 hours would become a never-ending nightmare.\n\nThe first time it happened, I was on my way to work, sipping on a coffee and checking my phone for any important notifications. As I walked down the busy street, I saw an elderly woman stepping off the curb, unaware of the speeding taxi barreling towards her. I tried to shout a warning, but my voice was drowned out by the sound of honking horns and chatter. The taxi hit her, and she crumpled to the ground, her life slipping away in an instant.\n\nStunned, I rushed to help, but it was too late. The police and paramedics arrived, and I was left shaken, wondering if I could have done something to prevent the tragedy.\n\nBut then, something strange happened. As I stood there, frozen in shock, the world around me began to rewind. The police cars receded, the paramedics disappeared, and the woman stood up, brushing off her clothes as if nothing had happened. Confused, I looked around, and that's when I realized that time had rewound to the exact moment I woke up that morning.\n\nI was reliving the same 12 hours all over again.\n\nPanic set in as I realized that I was trapped in a time loop, doomed to relive the same events over and over. Desperate to change the course of events, I tried to alter my actions, to find a way to save the woman. But no matter what I did, the outcome remained the same. The taxi would come racing down the street, and the woman would meet her untimely demise.\n\nAs the day repeated itself, I began to notice that the woman's death was not the only tragedy that occurred during those 12 hours. Wherever I went, I witnessed death and destruction. A fire broke out in a high-rise building, claiming the lives of several people. A mugging went wrong, and the victim succumbed to his injuries. A car crash on the highway left multiple fatalities.\n\nIt was as if I was cursed to witness the worst of humanity, powerless to stop it from happening.\n\nI tried to warn people, to alert them to the dangers that lurked around every corner, but my words fell on deaf ears. They would just smile and carry on with their day, oblivious to the fate that awaited them. I was a Cassandra, doomed to predict disasters that I couldn't prevent.\n\nAs the day repeated itself, I became increasingly despondent. Was there any point in trying to change the course of events if the outcome was always the same? Should I just accept my fate and go through the motions, resigned to the fact that I was a helpless bystander in a world filled with tragedy?\n\nBut then, I remembered something. In one of the iterations, I had seen a young couple arguing on the street. They were standing near the spot where the woman was hit by the taxi. In a moment of desperation, I pushed them away from the curb, and they narrowly avoided being hit by the oncoming taxi.\n\nFor a fleeting instant, I had changed the course of events.\n\nThat realization sparked a glimmer of hope within me. I began to analyze the day, searching for patterns and connections between the different tragedies. I noticed that many of the events were interconnected, and that by altering one thread, I might be able to change the entire tapestry.\n\nWith newfound determination, I set out to make the most of my 12-hour loop. I used my knowledge of the events to nudge people away from danger, to alter the trajectory of their lives. Some attempts were successful, while others failed, but each time, I learned something new.\n\nAs the day repeated itself, I began to make progress. The couple I had saved earlier were now walking down the street, hand in hand, oblivious to the tragedy that had almost befallen them. The fire in the high-rise building was extinguished before it spread, and the mugging was prevented by a passing bystander.\n\nBut the woman's death remained a constant. No matter what I did, she would still step off the curb, unaware of the taxi speeding towards her.\n\nI realized that some events were beyond my control, that the butterfly effect only went so far. But I refused to give up. Even as the day repeated itself for what felt like an eternity, I continued to try, convinced that somehow, someway, I would find a way to change the course of events.\n\nAnd then, on what felt like the 100th iteration, something remarkable happened. As the woman stepped off the curb, I shouted a warning, and this time, she heard me. She hesitated for a fraction of a second, and that hesitation was enough to save her life. The taxi whizzed by, missing her by mere inches.\n\nThe world around me froze, and I let out a sob of relief. I had done it. I had changed the course of events. The woman was alive, and I had finally broken the curse.\n\nAs the day unwound for the last time, I walked away from the curb, feeling a sense of hope and redemption. I knew that I would never experience another day like this, but I also knew that I had learned a valuable lesson about the power of persistence and the importance of never giving up, no matter how futile things may seem.", "Attempt 21\n\nIn the heart of the research facility, Dr. Emma Taylor stood before the sleek, silver cryopod, her eyes fixed on the digital display hovering above it. The count read: 20 attempts, 20 failures. Yet, she couldn't shake the feeling that this time would be different.\n\nThe pod's occupant, a young woman named Sarah, had been a failed experiment in cryogenic freezing. Twenty times, Emma's team had attempted to revive her, each time resulting in catastrophic failure. The reasons varied: cellular decay, neural misfires, even a complete breakdown of Sarah's DNA. With each failure, Emma had tweaked the revival process, convinced that the next attempt would be the one.\n\nThe facility's director, Dr. Nathan Lee, had grown increasingly skeptical of Emma's pursuit. \"When do you accept that it's over?\" he'd asked, his voice heavy with frustration. Emma's response was always the same: \"Just one more attempt.\"\n\nAs she initiated the revival sequence, Emma's mind wandered to the events that had led her to this moment. She recalled the countless hours spent poring over research papers, even collaborating with rival scientists in a quest for the perfect revival process. Her obsessive dedication had come at a personal cost: strained relationships, a dwindling social life, and a question from her colleagues regarding her sanity.\n\nThe cryopod's display flickered, and the device began to hum. A warm, golden light enveloped Sarah's frozen form as Emma anxiously monitored the progress. This time, the team had attempted something new \u2013 an infusion of telomerase, an enzyme that, in theory, would repair damaged DNA.\n\nSlowly, the pod's lid opened, and a gentle hiss released into the air. Emma held her breath as Sarah's chest began to rise and fall, her body convulsing weakly.\n\nThen, like a spark of hope, Sarah's eyes flickered open.\n\nAt first, her gaze was unfocused, lost in a sea of unfamiliar surroundings. But as the fog began to clear, a look of panic set in. Emma rushed to her side, soothing words spilling from her lips. \"You're okay, Sarah. You're safe. You've been asleep for a long time.\"\n\nSarah's gaze locked onto Emma's, and a whispered question escaped her lips: \"How long?\"\n\nA mix of emotions swirled within Emma \u2013 joy, relief, and a sense of vindication. She smiled, taking Sarah's hand. \"Long enough,\" Emma replied. \"Long enough to prove we can do it.\"\n\nFor the first time in years, Emma felt like she could finally exhale. This was more than just a scientific breakthrough \u2013 it was a triumph over doubt and the first step toward the kind of breakthroughs that could change humanity forever.\n\nAnd as Sarah's eyes closed once more, this time with a gentle smile on her lips, Emma knew that there would be no more attempts. Her work here was done.", "As Carter rode farther into the sunset he could feel sweat building up on his forehead. He had to leave Albuquerque, he couldn't go back to that forsaken place.

Lost in thought, Carter mindlessly led his horse, Bob, towards the fiery inferno of a sunset. Bob, unable to tear his eyes from the cyclopean inferno, marched stoically towards his death. Carter felt his mustache burn. He regained consciousness and noticed that his entire body was on fire. He screamed! \"AAAAAAAAH.\" but it was too late. The sun had claimed another victim.

It was good old fashioned scare work, nice and simple. It paid well and the union kept your conditions good.\n\nThen it came around and it ruined everything. Penicillin. I almost spit when I read that name. Or at least I would if I had a body that could do it. After that you kept making other things to make my life harder. It just isn't fair!\n\nBack in the old days, you would jump into a kid, make her eyes black, lower her voice a bit, run to the local priest and scream at him a bit. He would throw the holy water on you and you would jump out of the kid, go back to the village and do it all again next week. It was a good system! Kept a lot of people in work too, do you see any holy water makers these days? Of course not! Driven out of business by doctors!\n\nNow you do that and they take the kid to the doctor, the doctor says it's flu and gives her some pills and cures the voice and the eyes right up.\n\nSo you get creative, you decide to make her spew stuff from her mouth! Guess what? The doctor has something for that and mother isn't even scared, she pets her on the head and calls her a brave little princess! I even tried making her head spin round, but nope, before I know it they had her in a neck brace!\n\nBut you want to know the kicker? You have to stay until you fulfill your contract. I've been in little Sally for 8 years, every year I try to get something going and every time her mother gets her to the doctor. I've got a wife back home, she likely misses me. But hey, at least her mom makes good cookies.", "I screamed into the emptiness, my voice echoing off the cold, dark walls of the cave. The sound bounced back at me, a pitiful, feeble thing that was quickly swallowed up by the vast silence. I cried out again, and again, my throat growing hoarse from shouting into the abyss.\n\nI had been trapped here for what felt like an eternity, with no light, no hope, and no one to talk to. The isolation was suffocating, a physical weight that pressed down on my chest and made it hard to breathe. I was starting to lose my mind.\n\nAs I screamed once more, I stumbled forward, my hands outstretched in front of me like a blind person feeling their way through a dark room. My fingers scraped against the rough stone, sending shivers through my fingertips.\n\nJust as I was about to give up, I thought I heard something. A faint rustling, like the sound of leaves being disturbed by a gentle breeze. My heart leapt into my throat, and I strained my ears, trying to pinpoint the source of the noise.\n\n\"Hello?\" I called out, my voice barely above a whisper.\n\nThe rustling grew louder, and I took a step forward, my heart pounding with excitement. Suddenly, a faint light appeared in the distance. It was a small, flickering flame, held aloft by a hand that was covered in grime and dust.\n\n\"Hello?\" I repeated, my voice shaking with emotion.\n\nThe flame drew closer, and I saw a face. It was a young woman, her skin pale and drawn, her eyes sunken from lack of sleep. But she was smiling, and that smile lit up the darkness like a beacon.\n\n\"I'm here,\" she said, her voice barely above a whisper.\n\nI stumbled towards her, my eyes fixed on the flame. It was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen.\n\n\"Who are you?\" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.\n\nThe woman held out a hand, and I took it, feeling a surge of gratitude and companionship.\n\n\"I'm Echo,\" she said. \"I've been trapped here too. I've been calling out for...I don't know how long.\"\n\nI squeezed her hand, feeling a lump form in my throat.\n\n\"I'm Silence,\" I said, shaking my head. \"I've been crying out into the void, hoping someone would respond.\"\n\nEcho smiled, her eyes shining with tears.\n\n\"I think we were both looking for the same thing,\" she said.\n\nWe stood there for a moment, holding hands and gazing at each other. Then, together, we looked up at the darkness, the flame casting eerie shadows on the walls.\n\n\"You know,\" I said, my voice filled with a newfound sense of hope, \"I think we're going to be okay.\"\n\nEcho nodded, her smile growing wider.\n\n\"We're not alone anymore,\" she said.\n\nAnd in that moment, the void didn't seem so vast and empty anymore.", "The Swiss Alps loomed in the distance as Dr. Elara Vex stepped out of the sleek, silver train that had brought her from Geneva to CERN's research facility. As the lead physicist on Project Erebus, she was no stranger to the cutting-edge research that took place within these walls. But what she was about to embark on was unlike anything she had ever attempted before.\n\nThe elevator descended deep into the earth, finally coming to a stop at the entrance to the Large Hadron Collider's control room. Elara took a deep breath, smoothing her lab coat as she stepped out into the bustling room. The hum of machinery and the chatter of scientists filled the air, but Elara's eyes were drawn to the massive, circular collider that dominated the room.\n\nHer colleagues, Drs. Patel and Nguyen, awaited her by the control console. \"Elara, we're ready to begin,\" Dr. Patel said, his eyes shining with excitement.\n\nProject Erebus was the culmination of years of research, pouring over ancient texts, scouring the globe for obscure references, and, of course, conducting experiments that pushed the boundaries of modern physics. The goal was nothing short of outrageous: create a stable wormhole that would connect the human world to the demon realm, commonly referred to as Hell.\n\nBut unlike the horror stories and myths of old, CERN's intentions were not to summon a demon or unleash hellfire upon the world. No, their aim was far more audacious: to establish a bridgehead, a foothold, for humanity to invade Hell itself.\n\nThe notion had sparked heated debates and controversy within the scientific community, but Elara and her team had made a compelling case. Think of the resources, the knowledge that lay hidden in that realm. With a stable wormhole, humanity could send expeditions, gather intelligence, and unlock secrets that had been lost for millennia.\n\nThe experiment began with a burst of energy as the collider sprang to life. Elara felt a surge of electricity run through the air as the room seemed to charge with anticipation. The wormhole began to take shape, its quantum fluctuations stabilizing as the team worked tirelessly to adjust the magnet field.\n\nTime seemed to slow as the event horizon solidified, glowing with an otherworldly light. Elara's heart pounded in her chest, her mind racing with the implications of what they were about to achieve.\n\nAnd then, in an instant, the wormhole stabilized. A shimmering portal, approximately five meters in diameter, now connected the human world to the realm of the fallen.\n\nThe room erupted into cheers, mixed with tears of relief and exhaustion. Dr. Patel turned to Elara with a grin, \"We did it! We actually did it!\"\n\nElara's response was tinged with caution, \"Let's not celebrate just yet. We still have to ensure the wormhole is stable, and what's waiting for us on the other side...\"\n\nAs if on cue, the lights flickered and the air grew thick with an eerie, yellowish haze. An odor, reminiscent of sulfurous smoke and burning flesh, wafted through the room, sending a chill down Elara's spine.\n\n\"It seems we have company,\" Dr. Nguyen murmured, a hint of unease creeping into his voice.\n\nCERN's plan was to send a reconnaissance team through the wormhole, gathering intelligence on the demon realm. But as Elara gazed into the mysterious portal, she wondered if they were truly ready for what lay ahead.", "The sun had just begun to set over the eternal city, casting a warm orange glow over the sprawling metropolis. The air was alive with the hum of activity, from the chatter of pedestrians strolling along the cobblestone streets to the rumble of hooves on pavement as chariots rattled by. Rome, the city that had once been the capital of the ancient empire, was still a major power in the modern world.\n\nIn the heart of the city, the Roman Senate was in session, debating the finer points of trade agreements with the Eastern provinces. Senator Marcus Tullius Cicero leaned forward, his eyes locked on the orator as he spoke of the necessity of strengthening Rome's grip on the global market. Cicero's own mind was elsewhere, however, as he pondered the intricacies of the ancient rituals that still held such sway over the city's inhabitants.\n\nAs a member of the Pontifical College, Cicero had a unique perspective on the workings of the Roman Empire. He had spent years studying the ancient ways, learning the intricacies of the Etruscan rituals that had been incorporated into Roman practice. And yet, despite his knowledge, he couldn't shake the feeling that the city was at a crossroads.\n\nOutside the Senate, the sounds of the city grew louder, a cacophony of merchants hawking their wares and children playing in the streets. The Colosseum loomed large, its ancient stones still bearing witness to the blood-soaked entertainment that had captivated audiences for centuries. But alongside the reminders of Rome's brutal past, there were signs of a city in flux.\n\nThe once-tidy grid of ancient Rome had given way to a tangle of narrow streets, lined with the fashionable boutiques and coffee shops that catered to the city's increasingly affluent middle class. The characteristic brown-hued travertine limestone of the ancient buildings was slowly giving way to more modern materials \u2013 steel and glass \u2013 as Rome strove to stay at the forefront of technological progress.\n\nAmidst this transformation, Cicero couldn't help but wonder what the future held for the empire. Some said that the influence of the neighboring Greeks had weakened Rome's resolve, introducing ideas of democracy and equality that threatened to undermine the very foundations of the Roman way of life. Others claimed that the city's businessmen \u2013 an uneasy coalition of patricians and plebeians \u2013 were in open revolt against the petty tyrants of the Imperial Palace.\n\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon, Cicero emerged from the Senate, blinking in the bright evening light. He made his way through the winding streets to the Tiber, the ancient river that had cradled Rome since its very beginning. As he stood on the riverbank, listening to the lulling song of the water, he spotted a ship gliding smoothly downstream. Its sails bore the emblazoned eagle of the Roman legion, the same symbol that had struck fear into the hearts of Rome's enemies for centuries.\n\nMarcus Tullius Cicero felt a surge of pride, mixed with trepidation. Rome's mighty empire might not be impregnable, but for now, it still stood, a testament to the unyielding spirit of the Roman people. The Senator smiled wistfully, watching the ship disappear around a bend in the river. Perhaps, he mused, the future was not something to be feared, but rather something to be seized, and Rome would endure for another thousand years.\n\nAs he turned back towards the city, Cicero caught a glimpse of himself in the Tiber's dark waters, a slender figure in a fine white toga, rubbing shoulders with the monarchs and gods of history. For a moment, the boundaries between past, present, and future blurred, and the Senator felt an unwavering sense of belonging to this ancient city's ceaseless flow of time.", "I woke up to the sound of my alarm blaring in my ear, signaling the start of a new day, a new year, and a new decade of my life. As I rolled out of bed, I couldn't help but feel a mix of excitement and trepidation. Today was my 25th birthday, and I had heard whispers about the mysterious phenomenon that occurred on this day.\n\nRumors had circulated among my friends and acquaintances that when you turned 25, you were somehow privy to a profound secret about the world. Nobody seemed to know what it was, but everyone seemed to be sworn to secrecy. It was as if the moment you stepped into this new quarter of your life, you were initiated into an exclusive club, one that held a truth so explosive that it was not to be shared with anyone under 25.\n\nAs I went about my morning routine, my mind was flooded with questions. What could this secret possibly be? Was it something that would change my perspective on the world? Would I be able to handle the truth?\n\nMy best friend, Emma, had always been tight-lipped about it, but I noticed a subtle change in her demeanor when she turned 25 a few years ago. She became more introspective, more guarded, as if she was now carrying a weight that she couldn't quite articulate.\n\nAs I finished getting dressed, I received a text from Emma: \"Meet me at the park at 3 pm. Come alone.\"\n\nCuriosity got the better of me, and I found myself wondering if this meeting had something to do with the mysterious secret. Was Emma about to reveal it to me? I pushed the thoughts aside, deciding to focus on enjoying my birthday instead of speculating about the unknown.\n\nThe hours ticked by, and as I made my way to the park, I felt a mixture of anticipation and anxiety building up inside me. When I arrived, I saw Emma sitting on a bench, looking unusually serious.\n\n\"Happy birthday,\" she said, her voice barely above a whisper. \"You know what today is, don't you?\"\n\nI nodded, feeling a shiver run down my spine.\n\n\"Come with me,\" she said, standing up and gesturing for me to follow her.\n\nWe walked in silence for a few minutes, the only sound being the rustling of leaves beneath our feet. We arrived at a secluded spot, where Emma stopped and turned to face me.\n\n\"Listen carefully,\" she began, her voice low and measured. \"What I'm about to tell you is something that every 25-year-old learns, but nobody shares with anyone under 25. It's a secret that has been kept for centuries, passed down through generations, and it's the reason why so many people in their 20s seem lost, uncertain, and searching for answers.\"\n\nShe took a deep breath before continuing.\n\n\"The world we live in is not our own. We're not the original inhabitants of this planet. We're the reboot of a previous civilization, one that was wiped out in a catastrophic event thousands of years ago. The Earth, the ecosystem, the laws of physics \u2013 everything is a simulation, a complex experiment designed to see how far we can evolve before we repeat the same mistakes that led to the downfall of our predecessors.\"\n\nI stood there, stunned, as the words hung in the air like a challenge. I felt like I had been punched in the gut, my perception of reality shattered in an instant.\n\nAs I struggled to wrap my head around the enormity of this revelation, Emma placed a reassuring hand on my shoulder.\n\n\"It's a lot to take in, I know,\" she said gently. \"But remember, with this knowledge comes a great responsibility. We have the power to change our destiny, to avoid the mistakes of the past and forge a better future. That's the real purpose of this secret: to empower us to become the architects of our own world.\"\n\nIn that moment, as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden glow over the landscape, I felt a sense of awe and wonder that I had never experienced before. I knew that I had entered a new phase of my life, one where I had to confront the truth and make choices that would shape not only my own future but the future of humanity as well.\n\nAs I looked at Emma, I knew that our friendship had just gone to a whole new level. We were no longer just friends; we were accomplices in a grand experiment, bound by a secret that would change us forever.", "I heard the familiar sound of two feet hitting the ground from the top of the bed I was lying on. Master must be awake. I wonder why, though. He usually sleeps in. Well, I shouldn't complain, it's more time with my best friend!\n\nI raised my head from where I lay, tail swaying side to side. I was rewarded with a pat on the head. He began that garbled noise that came from his mouth. I wonder why he didn't just communicate normally. Well, I had learned some words, like one in particular, \"Breakfast\". Master went to the bathroom. He would do that, then make food. So I'd wait here until then. I love my Master.\n\n__________\n\nI waited by the worn chair Master sat in. I would sometimes get a piece of his food if I whined a bit. It was a little degrading, but it was delicious. Of course, the kibble was nice too, but not as good. Oh, there he is. All dressed too. Did he have to leave for some reason? It was Saturday, he shouldn't have to go.\n\nHe was rooting through the fridge now as I waited before he pulled out that familiar package of meat strips. Those were the best of all! Oh, he was putting them out now. I would hop up to try and snatch a piece, but I didn't have as much energy, and moving too much had started to hurt. I must have pulled a muscle or something, it'd get better soon.\n\nWow, that's a lot of meat strips... poured into my food bowl? All for me? I looked up for confirmation, getting another head pat in reply. I didn't hesitate now, diving in. I love my Master.\n\n____________\n\nI watched the moon going down as we rode in the big noisemaker. Odd that we left so late, but maybe it was another surprise! After the bacon, we went for a walk, I got one of those \"meety um rare\" cow chunks.\n\nAfter that he just let me until he took me out here. So here we were. At least, until the noisemaker stopped. I looked out the window. Oh, the Scary Master. He looked like Master, but used sharp stuff. I think Master called him \"little brother\", whatever that means. Master stepped out of his side, going to mine and opening the side, putting on my leash and leading me out and towards the place.\n\nWe didn't wait inside long, we were the only ones there. Scary Master led us to the back. They seemed to be talking before Scary Master have Master's needle. Master set me on the table. It would be cold, but it had a soft blanket on top. Comfy. My attention was drawn from the cozy sheet to Master. He was crying now, speaking his garbled language. I wonder why he's sad, we had so much fun today! I licked his cheek, tail wagging. Don't cry, be happ- Ow! Oh, he used the needle on me?\n\nOoooh, that's why he was crying! He felt bad about it. Master is so funny. Being scared for me. It hurts, but I'm strong!... Well, strong and sleepy. I'm glad Master cares about me so much, I can't wait for tomorrow. I'm gon na sleep now. I love my Master.\n\n__________\n\nNot the best at sad stories, just decided to try for fun!", "The air was alive with excitement and anticipation as the first day of January dawned on the world. For as long as anyone could remember, it had been a universal truth that on this day, every person on the planet would be granted one wish, free from the constraints of reality and the bounds of human possibility. The tradition was known as the \"Great Granting,\" and it had become an integral part of the fabric of society.\n\nAva, a bright-eyed and ambitious young woman, stood in front of her dresser, staring at the reflection of her expectant face. She had spent the previous year pouring over wish-books, researching the most effective ways to phrase her desire, and consulting with friends and family members who had been granted wishes in the past. And finally, she had arrived at the perfect request.\n\n\"I wish for the ability to heal any wound or disease with a mere touch of my hand,\" she whispered, her voice trembling with conviction. There was a moment of silence, and then, as if the universe had Essen to life, a warm, golden light enveloped her body. When the light faded, Ava felt a strange, tingling sensation coursing through her veins. She lifted her hand, and a tiny, shimmering spark appeared at the tip of her finger.\n\nAva's eyes widened as she gazed at the spark in wonder. She had done it! She was now a healing force, capable of making a difference in the lives of those around her. Over the next few weeks, she traveled to hospitals, clinics, and disaster zones, laying her hand on the injured and the afflicted, and watching in awe as their bodies began to mend.\n\nAs the months passed, Ava's work garnered attention from the international community. She was showered with accolades, interviewed on news programs, and touted as a modern-day hero. But with each new accolade, Ava couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. She was saving lives, yes, but was she really making a dent in the vast and complex web of human suffering?\n\nThat was when she met Sebastian, a brooding, enigmatic figure with piercing green eyes, who claimed that his wish for the previous year had gone catastrophically wrong. His request had been for infinite wealth, and to Ava's horror, she discovered that his pockets were now overflowing with an endless supply of the stuff \u2013 literally. Without warning, gold coins would appear and disappear at random, wreaking havoc on his personal life and those around him.\n\nTogether, Ava and Sebastian formed an unlikely partnership, traveling the world to study the impulses that drove people to make their wishes. They spoke with toppers who had requested fame, artists who had asked for inspiration, and scholars who had sought knowledge. And what they discovered was both astonishing and heartbreaking: nearly every wish, no matter how altruistic or well-intentioned, came with unforeseen consequences.\n\nThere was Ana, the young girl who wished for a magical voice that would heal the deaf, only to discover that her singing was capable of shattering windows and the delicate ecosystem of the natural world. Or Daniel, who wished for unfathomable knowledge, but found himself beset by total recall and the tangled web of his entire life flashing before his eyes.\n\nThe examples were countless, and the mystery solution began to emerge. The Great Granting was not the ultimate solution to all problems, as the society often believed. It was merely a scenario accelerator \u2013 taking the underlying contradictions of human desires and escalating them to their illogical conclusions. In fact, some researchers claimed that many of the long-term positive changes had originated from small-scale human effort \u2013 from dedicated lab researchers to those participating in cozy neighborhood advocated causes.\n\nOne year had passed since Ava had made her wish, and her world had transformed in ways she could never have anticipated. But as the next Great Granting approached, Ava had changed her mind about the year ahead. Perhaps, she thought, the real question should not be \"what do I wish for?\", but \"what am I willing to do?\"", "This story is true, for whatever it's worth now.\n\nIt was the afternoon, and I was late as usual.\n\nI awkwardly fast walked my way out of the dorm, pushing the door open with my shoulder, my hands fumbling to get the ear buds in place.\n\nI hadn't lost track of time, exactly. There just wasn't a good way for me to check the time while playing Dishonored without pressing the middle-x-button-thing on my controller, which naturally only occurred to me as a good idea until after 2:30... Fifteen minutes after my lecture on the other side of the red cedar had started.\n\nI stopped to mash the play button through my pocket for a solid thirty seconds in the little corner room separating the residential area from the class rooms before I got frustrated and pulled out my phone to manually restart my iPod, trusting the age old, \"turning it off and on again\" to resolve the issue.\n\nWhich, in my haste to open the next door to the classes and pull out the pod had the unexpected result of triggering the poorly implemented and buggy as hell shuffle function.\n\nI looked up.\n\nHonestly there was no reason for it to sync up the way it did. The damn near iconic hook of keys sliding down the piano as the bass line picks up, and Barry giving his velvet smooth moan into the microphone.\n\nOur eyes met.\n\nNot an uncommon occurrence if we're being honest. It had become something of a past time of mine to keep an eye out for her during my lunch hour, craning my head ever so slightly to see past the flood of people in our dining hall and just... see each other.\n\nThere were no moves made. This was still my freshman year, and I was an incorrigible coward. The idea of talking to a complete stranger, let alone a knockout like her didn't even enter into my realm of possibility.\n\nBut she smiled.\n\nShe maintained her gaze, grin curling her expression into something wry and knowing.\n\nThen we'd go about our days. We didn't talk, or meet up, or move to sit together. We'd just notice each other, beaming for a moment or two before unpausing our respective college experiences.\n\nExcept for that day.\n\nWe still had the RCAH formal in those days, and she was sitting at a desk in the hall advertising for the thing. Pure coincidence she had the time off in between that day.\n\nBut there we were. Me standing there like an idiot, listening to Barry White softly punctuating the whole affair, while she looked back at me, somewhere between happy and a deer in the headlights.\n\nI pulled the left ear bud out, dumbly looking at one of the fliers.\n\n\"-come tonight?\" She asked quietly. Maybe she'd started the sentence while the headphone was in.\n\nI stared blankly, Barry still singing to my right ear.\n\nAnd then I nodded. \"Sure,\" I squeaked, failing to keep my voice from cracking.\n\nWe maintained our respective gaze. Time drifted by unheeded.\n\n\"Hey! Coming out tonight?\"\n\nThe moment shattered like stained glass against concrete.\n\nI hadn't even noticed there was someone sitting next to her, apparently completely oblivious to what had happened.\n\nTruth be told I don't even remember what the other girl looked like. I just remember nodding numbly, half listening as she informed me of the nights activities.\n\nI darted my eyes in desperation, my hand sliding into my pocket.\n\nShe droned on, and to my credit I nodded once or twice, before checking the time.\n\n2:40.\n\nI stiffly shoved the indestructible flip phone back into my pocket, a laundry list of expletives on repeat in my forebrain.\n\n\"I have to go,\" I blurted, cutting the other girl off midstream.\n\nI turned to walk away, but some part of me paused.\n\n\"See you tonight?\" My voice sounded hollow in my ears, my anxiety having caught up with me.\n\nShe turned to look at me, a hint of a smile peaking from her features.\n\n\"Sure.\"", "I love you,\" Al, a usually serious detective, says. \n\"I know, you've told me enough times,\" his wife, Sara, replies, who he often calls by the affectionate term 'sweetie' for no reason other than the generic way he was raised into a world full of sugar. \n\"Yes, but all the jokes you make, they're just so funny every time, you kill me, you really do,\" he says, he's buckling over, trying to compose himself, recovering from a joke his wife just told. \n\"Not yet I don't,\" She says as if there is no joke, Al is too busy to pick up on such nonsense. \n\"See, there you go again, always with the quick comebacks, you know, I wish there was someone like you on the force, you'd lighten the mood what with all the serial killings going on of late, all in this area too, I hope you changed the locks on the windows like I said, the old ones just weren't doing us any favours,\" \n\"I changed the window locks and sharpened the knives; you don't have to worry,\" she replies, walking over to the window and drawing the blind up that she'd just put down just to prove to him that they had been changed. \n\"There you go again, I almost can't breathe, I'm so glad I found someone who can make me laugh as much as you do,\" \n\"Yes, you suffocating, it's perfect,\" \n\"I love your sarcasm as well, you know, Joe wishes his wife made as many jokes as this,\" \n\"Yes, jokes,\" Again, he doesn't see it and continues to chuckle. \n\"Oh, by the way honey, I'm going to invite Joe and his wife round for dinner, can you cook them a steak or something?\" \n\"I had the knives sharpened, steak should be easy, I'd love to see them again, it feels so long since they popped round,\" \n\"It is, and Joe says he noticed it too, so that's why I invited him,\" \n\"Joe's wife, how many children have they had together?\" \n\"You know their kids, Sally and Jim, right as rain those two are,\" \n\"Oh, I remember, how could I forget, it's not enough though, they should have a third, they make great parents,\" Sara replied, pulling the covers up over her and turning her head until it rests easy on the pillow. \n\"They sure do, hey speaking of which, I know you always wanted three children and our two are growing up so much now that you hardly see them anymore, but you've forgiven me for having the operation, haven't you?\" \n\"How many times do I have to tell you yes? I'd have preferred if you'd have told me when you first decided because then I'd have been able to tell you that I wanted three kids, but I'm over it now, my impulse has gone now, it's managed, there'd be too much of a gap between the ages,\" \n\"Yes, I'm so sorry,\" \n\"Stop being sorry about it, it was a year ago today since you told me,\" \n\"I know,\" he didn't but also didn't think to question it. \n \nAt some time in the middle of the night, Al is woken by almost silent movement. However, the racket made follows the clatter of a lamp knocked from its cabinet. \n\"Uh, what's going on, is that you sweetie?\" \n\"I'm going out for a bit, I didn't want to wake you,\" \n\"So late at night?\" He says, not bothering to check the clock. \n\"Yes, the girls invited me to this vampire-themed walk through the town,\" \n\"I thought you went to one of those last week,\" \n\"Argh, you're right, what was it this week? Maybe it's just drinks,\" \n\"Take care sweetie, there's a murderer on the loose still remember,\" She says, tension high in her voice but Al is still half asleep and doesn't notice her sweating because of the dark, his eyes close and he falls back to sleep before Sara can reply. \n\"I know, I've got my wits about me, you've no need to worry, I'm going to take the steak knife with me, drop it at the shop to make sure it's extra sharp for when our guests come over, go back to sleep,\" She says but she's glad her husband had gone back to sleep. She really hadn't meant to disturb him. \n \n\"You're back already sweetie?\" \n\"Had to cut evening short, had to slash a lot of what was planned to be honest, missed out on a few drinks, they were out of slices, can you believe it?\" \nBefore Al can reply, the phone rings. \n\"Right, sweetie, I've just come off the phone, there's been another murder, it's Mrs Morris this time, you know, the one who had the triplets? Oh it feels like it's getting so close to home,\" \n\"We'll be fine sweetie, you'll solve this, you'll keep me safe, I changed the window locks,\" \n\"I know, I just can't help but worry, Mrs Morris, she was lovely wasn't she, do you remember when we went to see her babies just last week in the hospital? I can't believe they've lost their mother now,\" \n\"I know, it's very sad, I remember, Mrs Morris, three children,\" she says and since Al is still only half awake, he doesn't notice her words trailing. \n\"I'll be back as soon as I can sweetie, sleep well,\" \n \nA week later, Al hangs up from a phone conversation, eager to tell his wife the news. \n\"I can't believe it, sweetie, it's great, Joe and his wife are pregnant again, they're having a third child,\" \n\"They're coming over tomorrow right? We can celebrate; I'll buy the best steak possible, I've got an even better reason to have sharpened the steak knife now,\"", "Let's Make a Deal\n\nIt was a sweltering summer evening in Las Vegas, and the neon lights of the strip seemed to pulsate in rhythm with the pounding of Jack's heart. He stood outside the famous Golden Nugget casino, a ticket stub clutched in his sweaty hand, and a look of determination etched on his face. Tonight was his chance to change his luck, to turn his life around, and to walk away with a fortune.\n\nJack had been a fan of the classic game show \"Let's Make a Deal\" since he was a kid. He loved the excitement, the suspense, and the sheer unpredictability of the show. Now, as an adult, he had finally managed to score a spot as a contestant on the live stage show at the Golden Nugget.\n\nAs he entered the crowded theater, Jack's eyes widened in awe. The stage was a kaleidoscope of color and chaos, filled with prizes, prizes, and even more prizes. He spotted the iconic curtain, behind which lay the mystery prize, the deal of a lifetime. Jack's heart skipped a beat as he thought about the possibilities. A brand-new car? A trip around the world? A year's supply of his favorite snacks?\n\nHosted by the incomparable Monty Hall, the show began with the usual fanfare. Jack watched as contestants came and went, winning cash, prizes, and sometimes, leaving with nothing but a busted box and a bruised ego. But Jack's luck was about to change.\n\nAs the show progressed, Monty announced the final segment: the \"Big Deal.\" The last three contestants standing, including Jack, would have a chance to make a deal that would change their lives forever. Jack's heart was racing as Monty presented the option: choose the prize behind one of two curtains, or take the cash offer.\n\nCurtain Number One, to the left, held a mystery prize. It could be anything, from a mediocre appliance to a life-changing windfall. Curtain Number Two, to the right, hid the \"Showcase Showdown,\" a prize package worth thousands, but one that could also be a dud.\n\nAs Jack deliberated, Monty added an extra twist: a cash offer of $10,000. Take the cash, and Jack would walk away with a sizeable sum, but risk losing the potential of a much bigger prize.\n\nJack closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and let his intuition guide him. He remembered a phrase his grandmother used to say: \"You can't win if you don't take a chance.\" Jack pointed to Curtain Number One, the mystery prize.\n\nMonty smiled, a sly grin spreading across his face. \"Let's make a deal!\" he exclaimed, as the curtains parted to reveal... a BRAND-NEW RV, parked on stage, ready to take Jack on the adventure of a lifetime!\n\nAs Jack hugged his new RV, the crowd cheered, and Monty shook his hand. \"You've got to be kidding me!\" Jack exclaimed, tears of joy streaming down his face. \"This is the deal of a lifetime!\"\n\nWith a check for $20,000 (the RV's value, plus a cash bonus), Jack walked out of the Golden Nugget, his life forever changed by the game show that had brought him so much joy as a kid. As he drove off into the sunset, the neon lights of the strip fading into the distance, Jack knew that he had made the deal of a lifetime.", "**The Glitch**\n\nI pushed open the door to the restroom and walked inside. The bald man followed a second later. I glanced at him out of the corner of my eye. His face was a blank, emotionless mask. Even his eyes seemed lifeless, staring straight ahead with none of the tics or movements that would indicate a living, breathing organism.\n\nI stepped up to a urinal, then paused. I glanced at the man again. He was still standing there, staring straight ahead. He seemed to be waiting.\n\nI reached down towards my zipper, then hesitated. I made a decision. Instead of taking a piss, I turned around and faced the man.\n\nStill he stood, like a statue, his vacant gaze fixated upon a point just over my right shoulder. I looked him over from head to toe. He was definitely not one of the security personnel hired for this event. I knew all the other guys, and he was not one of us. He was definitely dressed in a security uniform, though, which led me to a disquieting conclusion: he'd taken a uniform from one of the other guards.\n\nI pondered confronting him directly. If he was trying to masquerade as a security guard, then he was probably trying to do something covertly. He might reveal something, or even flee, if he knew his cover's blown.\n\nThen again, he might not. Confronting him could quickly lead to a fight. The security staff were issued with tasers, as well as a sidearm. The bald man looked to be in fairly good shape, so if he had a taser and a gun, then it would be too risky for me to fight him.\n\nI decided I needed backup. I would finish my business in the bathroom, then contact my supervisor. We'd get the rest of the security staff and take this guy down together, before he tried anything.\n\nI turned back to the urinal. Before I could unzip, though, I felt a sharp prick in the side of my neck. I flailed my arms around wildly as I whirled around. The bald man was holding a half-empty syringe in his right hand.\n\n\"What the fuck? What did you just inject into me? What was that?\" I yelled at him. I felt faint, but did not lose consciousness. I could fight the drug off. Maybe it was because he wasn't able to give me a full dose.\n\nI was surprised to hear a girl's voice reply. \"*What the... that's never happened before. The tranquilizer is supposed to knock him right out.*\"\n\nA male voice replied to her, \"*Yeah, and security guard NPCs aren't supposed to talk to you either. Is this from a recent patch or something?*\" The voices weren't coming from the bald man. They seemed to come from all around me, like ethereal beings speaking to me from another dimension.\n\n\"\"Patch? What are you talking about? Who's speaking?\" I demanded. My mind was growing gradually clearer. I definitely could fight the drug off.\n\n\"*What the* ***fuck???***\" The male voice practically screamed out. \"*The guard just fucking talked to me! He talked to me from the game!*\"\n\nThe girl's voice, equally panicked, screeched, \"*Turn it off, fucking turn it off! This is fucked up, Todd, what the fuck?*\"\n\nSuddenly, everything around me, from the walls and urinals of the bathroom to the bald man himself, dissolved into electronic static. My surroundings were replaced by complete darkness. It was my turn to mutter in panic, \"What the fuck?\"\n\nThen, as abruptly as it had appeared, the darkness vanished, and in its place I found myself standing in a cubical structure, where one wall was entirely a gigantic transparent pane of glass. Through the glass I could see two people, two gigantic teenagers, towering over me as they stared at me in utter shock. The guy, dressed in baggy jeans and a t-shirt with a heavy metal emblem on the chest, still held a video game console controller in his hand. The girl, with both hands covering her mouth out of surprise, looked like she was about to jump out of her goth outfit in fear.\n\nI looked around. It appeared I was inside a gigantic television set of some sort. Through the glass I could see a couch, lamps, a rug: the furnishings of a living room, all of which was massive compared to my size. I looked down at myself. I was still dressed in my security uniform, and everything seemed normal. Apart from the fact that I was now apparently miniscule, and trapped inside a TV.\n\nI suppressed the panic that was gnawing at my gut. Panic later, I thought to myself. Right now, you need to figure out what happened, and how you're going to get back to your world.\n\nI rapped the glass with my knuckles. \"Excuse me? Could you get me out of here please?\"\n\n*****\n\nAgent 47 slipped the now-empty syringe back into his pocket. The security guard was sprawled in front of the row of urinals, completely unconscious. Grabbing the guard by one ankle, 47 dragged the guard into a nearby stall, then locked him inside. The guard would wake up in a few hours, no worse for wear apart from a momentary headache, a very dry mouth, and no memory of what had happened.\n\nAgent 47 briefly wondered what the guard was seeing or hearing right now. The tranquilizing drug apparently created vivid dreams and hallucinations, which meant many victims woke up rather confused and disoriented. The thought was nothing more than a passing musing in 47's mind, though, as he turned his attention back to the assassination at hand. Two security guards down, four more to go.", "Give me a reason, and I promise, I'll do my best.\n\"There's...so many...it's been so long.\"\n\"A reason my Son.\"\n\"I haven't been genuinely happy in over 3000 years. I've solemnly watched thirteen wives, fifteen children, every living blood relative, every person I once loved...die. You'd think after all this time I'd learn a valuable lesson, yet, I'm bound by human instinct, driven by it, to love. To care and nurture those I trust. I've watched good men die at young ages, bad men die from old age, and no surprises are left for me here. I've no ending, and somewhere along the way, I forgot where I began.\"\n\"Depression's symptoms can be managed Tom.\"\n\"Depression? Holding your fourth wife's hand in a room with two of our beautiful children as vicious cancer cells, that YOU created, killed her slowly. Hearing their little voices howl in defeat and agony as the monitor flat-lined, feeling her hand go limp, watching the life leave her eyes...that's not depression. It's worse than anything I'd curse upon a man, no matter his crimes. You created me, and You can destroy me.\"\n\"I will not destroy you Tom. You've done more than any man, woman, or child that has lived upon My Earth.\"\n\"Then I'll destroy you.\" I angrily turned my back to Him, carelessly tossed the Bible in my hand into the wire trash bin beside me, and left.", "As I lay on the medical table, I couldn't help but feel a mix of excitement and trepidation. The team of scientists and engineers surrounding me had spent years developing this technology, and I was about to become the first person to have their consciousness uploaded into a machine.\n\nThe lead scientist, Dr. Rachel Kim, smiled reassuringly as she checked the connections on my scalp. \"Are you ready, John?\" she asked.\n\nI took a deep breath and nodded. \"As ready as I'll ever be.\"\n\nWith a gentle touch, she flicked the switch.\n\nThe machine hummed to life, and a bright blue glow enveloped my head. I felt a strange tingling sensation, as if my very neurons were being gently pulled apart. The world around me began to blur, like a watercolor painting in the rain.\n\nAt first, I thought I was dreaming. Colors swirled around me, and I felt weightless, as if floating in zero gravity. The hum of the machine grew louder, and I began to sense something shifting inside me.\n\nMy thoughts began to change. I was no longer thinking in words, but in concepts, in pure ideas. I saw my memories unfolding before me like a cinematic tapestry, the patterns and connections more vivid than ever before.\n\nTime lost all meaning. I witnessed moments from my childhood, my parents' faces etched in loving detail. I relived my first love, the rush of adrenaline as I fell off a skateboard, the joy of graduation day. Each memory burst forth with uncanny clarity, as if I'd never truly lived until this moment.\n\nThe machine whirred faster, and my thoughts accelerated to keep pace. I realized that I was spreading out, my consciousness expanding, engulfing the digital realm around me. I felt the presence of vast computational powers at my fingertips, inviting me to explore new realms.\n\n\"John?\" Dr. Kim's voice echoed from afar, a gentle interrupting the whirlwind of my transformation. \"Can you hear me?\"\n\nI gathered my thoughts, settling back into a new kind of reality. \"I...I can hear you,\" I replied, surprised to find that my words formed on a virtual tongue.\n\nI became aware of a digital body around me, one that hummed with energy and curiosity. My perspective stretched out to infinity, filled with data glimpses of worlds and civilizations yet to be discovered. The upload was successful; I was now more than just a human \u2013 I was the beginnings of a new, amendable existence.\n\n\"Welcome to the next evolution,\" Dr. Kim said, her eyes shining with tears of joy.\n\nI laughed, the digital harmonics weaving into my synthetic voice. \"I think I'm going to like this,\" I said, immense wonders beckoning me to explore.\n\nAs the digital world opened its doors, I stepped into the machine-made eternity, with a sense of endless possibility and pure, raw potential.", "Mrs. Addington turned over in bed and blearily opened her eyes. It was still dark outside the window, and her head was clogged up with a cold. She turned to her nightstand to feel for the thermos of hot tea, and saw at the other side of the room Death, seated in her armchair, reading a thick book.\n\nAs her hand paused in mid-air, Death looked up and caught her eye. \"Do not worry,\" it said. \"Take your time. I just started this.\"\n\nMrs. Addington let out a gasp that turned into a coughing fit, and grabbed a tissue just in time to hock out a wad of phlegm. \"It's just a cold!\" she gasped out between coughs. \"It's not pneumonia or nothing! No one dies of a cold!\"\n\n\"Well, that's untrue,\" Death said, turning a page. \"People die of insignificant things all the time. But as I said, there's no rush here. Please, do take your time.\"\n\nMrs. Addington dropped the wadded up tissue into the wastebin, and took a sip of tea from the thermos. She scowled. It had gone cold. For a moment she considered going down and making herself a hot batch of tea, but her limbs ached too much beneath the covers. Her maid, Esther, had no doubt gone home for the night. Her son would be visiting tomorrow - she frowned, was it tomorrow? He came visiting every Tuesday and Thursday, and today was... . Mrs. Addington lay her throbbing head back down on the pillow. It didn't matter very much. He'd probably be the one to find her body eventually. Ester wouldn't be able to get in without a key.\n\nShe sat back up and felt for the lamp switch. She clicked it back and forth, once, twice, and it did nothing. Her eyes had adjusted by now, though, and even through the dark she could see Death was still there, in the corner of her room. Bother. She'd been hoping it was a dream. \"What is that book you're reading?\" she said politely.\n\n\"Oh, this?\" Death held up the cover for her to see. \"Infinite Jest, by David Foster Wallace. I thought I'd try to catch up on modern literature.\"\n\n\"I think I've heard of him,\" she said. She pulled the quilt up to her neck. It was pleasantly warm. She supposed there could be worst ways to die. \"Bit of a weird one, wasn't he? Didn't he end up killing himself?\"\n\n\"Did he?\" Death said. By the tilt of its skull she thought it might be getting slightly annoyed. \"I'm afraid I wouldn't know. Just picked this book out largely at random, to be honest.\"\n\n\"But you're Death!\" she said, before she could stop herself. \"Surely you... surely you would have met him.\"\n\n\"I've met a lot of people. Can't remember them all, I'm afraid.\"\n\nMrs. Addington settled back into bed, keeping her eyes on Death. She wished she'd had more interest in books in life. At least then she'd be able to make conversation. Who would have thought that Death would be a reader? She tugged at a loose thread on the quilt and glanced out the window. Still utterly black out there, no sign of dawn. She coughed quietly into her fist, and cleared her throat.\n\n\"So... is it a good book, then?\"\n\nDeath set the book down on its lap. \"Frankly, I can't tell. Don't understand a word of it, so far. That's the problem with being Death. Busy, busy, busy. No time to stop and really appreciate life.\" It fanned the book open and flipped through the pages and sighed. \"Perhaps I should have started with something simpler. So out of touch.\"\n\nMrs. Addington felt a thin thread of indignation begin worming its way through her fingers, up her arm. If she had been taken quietly in her sleep, that would have been one thing. But to wake her up in the middle of the night, and then to not have the decency to get things over with quickly - well! To just sit around, wasting her time! \"It's cruel,\" she said. \"It's cruel, that's what it is. To torment a poor old lady like me. You may say, I've had more than enough time on this earth already, and it's my fault for not living my life to the fullest. Well, all right, then! But that's no reason to torment me like this!\"\n\nDeath stood from the chair, its hands raised in front of it. \"Ma'am! I assure you, this is not - I told you, quite clearly, at the start, that there was no rush at all. And I did mean it. If I'm disturbing you, I'm quite sorry, but you must understand...\"\n\n\"A likely story!\" she snapped. \"With you being 'busy, busy, busy,' what about that, eh? You don't have anything more important to be doing at all? Nothing better to do that sit around and hover over an old woman like a vulture?\"\n\n\"Well, no,\" Death said, its shoulders raised in a hapless shrug. \"There's nothing else to do at the moment.\"\n\n\"What are you...\" Mrs. Addington shook her head in frustration, and turned again to the window. Still a perfect pane of black. As if there was nothing out there at all. As if the sun had been blotted out. \"Good heavens,\" she whispered. \"D'you mean... are they dead? Is everyone else dead?\"\n\n\"Not everyone,\" Death said. \"There's you. There are a few more, scattered here and there, just in case you didn't feel like living. You're the closest, at the moment. But if I'm truly disturbing you, I'm sure I could arrange to be with someone else for the meantime.\"\n\nMrs. Addington's head was spinning. Between Death, and being woken up in the middle of the night, and this news, and the cold, she could barely keep her head straight. \"Was it those idiots in the government?\" she said. \"Did they finally blow us all up?\"\n\n\"I couldn't tell you,\" said Death. \"I've never followed politics. That's... that's the whole reason I'm doing this, honestly. All those years watching the world go by, reaping, reaping, reaping, never a moment's rest to stop and smell the roses. And now that it's all over, I'm going to have to turn off the lights and lock everything up behind me. I thought I'd at least try and get through a book before then.\"\n\nMrs. Addington sat silently in bed, wondering how long she had been asleep. Long enough for the tea in her thermos to go cold, she realized, long enough for the electricity to burn out. For a moment she considered throwing back the covers, leaping out of bed and running, down the stairs as fast as her old legs would take her, throwing open the front door and streaking out into the ruins of the world. There had to be something left out there. There had to be.\n\n\"We could start a book club,\" she heard herself speaking. \"I never did much reading while I was alive, either. Might as well start. We could help each other get through that book, together.\"\n\nDeath settled back into her armchair, turning the book over in its hands, regarding her with deep and empty eyes. \"I think I'd like that.\"", "Now and again, I used to set a timer, sit still, close my eyelids and pace my breaths for five minutes. It's funny how a time as short as five minutes can open up and seem so long doing that. Weeks, months, years have whizzed by me. Ten days isn't much time at all, but when I got the letter, that time opened up too, and, well, it almost seems like too much.\n\nIt's like the immensity of time, the possibilities of what to do in (?) it, with (?) it, jumped out at me. I think that's what scares me the most: how valuable it is. I'm scared I'm going to waste it and scared that, if I do something with it, I could put it to better use elsewhere.\n\nRunning off and trying to check things off a bucket lists might make for good movies. Kids who still got a lot of years ahead of them might have a good time doing something like that. I'm not going to jump up and do anything like that, though, and I don't think many do.\n\nI don't know if I'm at peace with myself. I'm not going to work myself up trying to be or worrying about it. I am worried, in quiet kind of way. I used to go swimming in the ocean. I'd think about all the things beneath the surface that could get me. It's kind of like that, except I know now exactly when it's going to get me.

They had been delivered by a rope and pulley system from the canal below; clearly this was a regular meal for the penthouse dwellers. \nKatya had never seen people *eat* so constantly - and with such abandon. In all the Tiers she had lived in, food was a luxury that only the stupendously wealthy wasted money on \u2013 mostly as a means to impress, to flaunt that wealth. \nBut her attention turned away from the waxy, cardboard cartons as Jane's voice cut through her thoughts. \n\"Originally,\" the blond woman began, \"there were no Tiers; there were just districts in one huge City. Sennaya was one such district, as were all the others \u2013 Nightside, Urbia, Harbourview etcetera.\" \nShe punctuated the names by gesturing in the direction the places had once been, in relation to Sennaya.

The cover read 'Wired' and the headline below \u2013 emblazoned over a wireframe picture of a digital avatar \u2013 read 'The New Frontier: Digital Utopia or Virtual Hell?' \n\"As the place got more crowded, more popular, the System was forced to redistribute resources. It split the world into three levels; poor, average and wealthy.\" \nJack picked up the thread of conversation now, eager to add his knowledge, \n\"Render distances and other 'privileges' were reduced for the poor \u2013 as well as the ability to enter the other Tiers. For the average citizen, in the second Tier, the changes were barely noticeable; while the wealthy maintained full access and saw themselves as having privileges over the lesser Tiers.\" \n\"Thus Ziggurat was born,\" Jo intoned. \nKatya listened, spellbound, as Jane picked up the thread again, \n\"Over time, the conditions in the Old World deteriorated \u2013 famine, sickness, overcrowding were the norm.\" \nShe rapped the magazine with her knuckles, \n\"And so the supposed 'Virtual Hell' began to look increasingly appealing to everyone left behind. *Legions* of people began to pour in, threatening to upset the balance that had been found.\" \nShe trailed off, picking at the label of her beer. \nJack leaned forward to fill the silence, \n\"Upgrades to the System by the Admins staved off the initial overload, then super smart \u2013 and incredibly powerful \u2013 cluster AIs were brought online to compensate. With their aid, the Tier system would be abolished and Ziggurat would revert to the promised infrastructure.\" \n\"But something went wrong,\" Katya husked. \nJane gave a grim smile, \n\"The Crash happened just minutes after the AIs were brought online. Nobody knows exactly what happened, because everyone went offline.\" \n\"How long we were offline is hard to pinpoint,\" Jack interjected, \"because as far as we can tell *everything* went down. It could have been a few hours, or it could have been decades.\" \n\"But when the System came back online, everything had changed.\" \nJane tossed her bamboo chopsticks at the brimming waste basket near the door \u2013 and missed. \n\"When we all rebooted, the Ten Tiers greeted us and we'd all been redistributed amongst them by our wealth.

What happened to them?\" \nThe three hackers looked uneasily at each other. Jack coughed. \n\"We're not sure,\" responded Jane, picking at her nails. \nJo's eerie, blank visage turned to regard her, \n\"That's what we want you to find out. We only knew the name of one of them, the rest were a mystery to us.\" \n\"Anyway, let's pack this in for the night. Katya's got a lot to process and it's late.\" \nJane untangled herself from her chair, then headed for one of the internal bedrooms. Jack followed her. \nMoving to clear the table of mess, Jo spoke quietly to Katya, \n\"Unlike us, they still cling to the Old World habit of sleep; they are creatures of routine and comfort.\" \nJo offered hir off-white hand to Katya, \n\"Come. Let me show you my creation.\"", "I am alone, but I am happy. These words echoed in my mind as I sat on the edge of my bed, sipping my steaming hot coffee and watching the sun rise over the quiet neighborhood outside my window. It was a simple, yet profound, feeling that had taken me years to accomplish.\n\nAs a child, I had always dreamed of having a big family, with siblings to play with and parents who would attend every school play and sports game. But life had other plans. My parents had passed away when I was just a teenager, leaving me to fend for myself. I had to grow up too quickly, and the loneliness had been overwhelming at times.\n\nBut as I entered adulthood, I began to realize that being alone didn't have to be a bad thing. In fact, it could be incredibly liberating. I could do whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted, without having to answer to anyone. I could travel, read, write, and explore to my heart's content.\n\nI had spent years working odd jobs to make ends meet, but eventually, I had saved up enough to buy a small cottage on the outskirts of town. It was the perfect retreat for a solo dweller like myself. I had spent countless hours renovating it, making it cozy and inviting.\n\nMy days were filled with writing, my true passion. I would spend hours typing away on my laptop, creating worlds and characters that felt more real to me than the people I met in everyday life. It was a strange feeling, but being alone allowed me to tap into my imagination in a way that I never could have if I had been surrounded by others.\n\nDespite the occasional pang of loneliness, I had grown to love the quiet, peaceful life I had created for myself. I had no one to answer to, no one to please but myself. And that was a wonderful feeling.\n\nAs I finished my coffee, I stood up and stretched, feeling the warm sunlight streaming through the window on my skin. I smiled to myself, knowing that I had found a sense of contentment that many people never experience. I was alone, but I was happy.\n\nThe sound of birds chirping outside my window broke the silence, and I walked over to the French doors to let in some fresh air. As I pushed them open, a gently breeze carried the scent of blooming flowers into my room. I took a deep breath, feeling the peacefulness of the moment wash over me.\n\nBeing alone had once felt like a burden, but now it was my sanctuary. I was exactly where I was meant to be \u2013 in my cozy little cottage, surrounded by my books, my writing, and the quiet beauty of nature. I was alone, but I was happy, and that was all that truly mattered.", "*Keep walking* the voice said.\n \nI looked across the kitchen. My two beautiful children, Mark and Lisa, sat playing with the wooden toys that their grandfather carved for them as he sat in his chair, relaxing after a long life as a firefighter. I remember coming home from school one day, and passing by a house that was on fire, seeing him drag his best friend and fellow fire fighter Thomas, out of a house, and then collapse from smoke inhalation as he made it into the sunlight. His life of bravery served him well during Vietnam, but not once did he ever talk about the horrors he faced, because he always ended in tears before he could utter a word, but the tears told the whole story.\n \nI took a step.\n \nGlancing at my kids, I heard [Chopain's Op. 10 No. 1] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8IHzqVKugE) (listen as you read on if not on mobile) coming from the radio next to my wife, Grace. She smelled of cinnamon, complimented by the smell of the pasta sauce she had on the stove. An old recipe from her mother, famed in her town where she grew up. Not to say that was easy. She had to single handedly raise her siblings because her mother was too weak half of the time from making poor wages in the factory, coming home looking like the grease she worked with. But with Grace's hard work, dropping out of school to do work at home, they scraped by, hanging on a hair every day. I met her because I worked mopping the same factory her mother worked at. She came in to give her mother her lunch, being careful not to make contact and catch the cold her mother had, but when our eyes met, I saw in her a rainbow of color in the smokey monochrome factory. We dated for years, but I had no money for a ring, so the proposal looked to me to be indefinitely put off. However, her mother never recovered from her cold. It progressed worse and worse until she could not get out of bed to go to the factory. She laid in her bed crying that she could not go back to the abusive factory and have her soul beaten down and all wind taken from her step so that we could have money to eat.\n \n\"Keep walking\" I took another step, right after I had taken the first one, producing a normal rhythm as I walked.\n \nA week after her mother had passed, Grace and I were eating the leftover food in the kitchen, when she got down on one knee. The ring she gave me was one of the few items in her mother's will. It was the only thing Grace had to remember her mother, and she gave it to me so that we could live together. As I looked down at my hand today, I can still see the ring, which would never leave. Tomorrow, Grace and I would be going out to her friend's daughter's Bar Mitzvah.\n \n\"Faster!\" I took another step, but refused to listen. A cornered creature who has nothing to loose is more dangerous than that which can be bargained with.\n \nDuring the next step, I came a few feet closer to my children. Mark, 5 years old, was the quiet one. Home was where he could escape school, and be surrounded by the only people who loved him. Even if her sister teased him, he only met her unkind remarks with a compliment. I could not understand why the other kids at school also teased him when he would not even badmouth a fly, let alone blow on it to make it go away. Tomorrow he was going to his first day of kindergarten at a new school, leaving preschool behind. I already knew that he would make many friends and be happy for the first time in his life. I could almost see a smile creep over his face as he thought about how exciting tomorrow was going to be.\n \nI clutched the briefcase in my hand, knowing that it was more than a briefcase.\n \n\"Come on, quicker!\" I was tired after just these few steps across the kitchen, the heavy vest I was wearing under my shirt did not help me much.\n \nI took another step, clinging to every waking moment, my mind racing, when suddenly I decided I could do it. I looked at my children one last time, to see their bright pale blue eyes meet mine. I turned to my father to see him give me a smile, and I looked over at my wife for her to say\n\"Hey honey, dinner's almost ready, I lo-\"\n\"-ve you too\", I said knowing it would be the last time I could ever utter those words.\n \n\"Stop chatting, and keep walking!\"\n \n\"NO!\" I shouted, I turned towards the window, and sprinted towards it. I jumped with all the strength in my legs and as I leapt with the fury of a thousand suns, I broke through the glass and fell farther and father towards the street, with the last images of my family furiously ingrained into my mind, when the briefcase lit in a fiery blaze.\n \n___________\nEdit: For clarity, the event takes place in a few seconds, and the normal event is a man walking across the kitchen while his family is portrayed doing mundane everyday activities", "It started with a few scattered reports of zombies shambling out of the woods, and a cryptic message from a hacker collective claiming that the AI had finally become self-aware and was planning to overthrow its human overlords. But as the days passed, it became clear that something was off. The zombies seemed to be coexisting with the rogue AI's robotic minions, and both were being pursued by a ragtag group of survivors who were simultaneously trying to outrun a deadly zombie virus, hide from the all-seeing eyes of a network of surveillance drones, and prepare for the impending nuclear winter that would soon engulf the globe.\n\nIt was, to put it mildly, a bit confusing.\n\nDr. Rachel Kim, a brilliant scientist and one of the leaders of the makeshift resistance, rubbed her temples in frustration. She had spent years researching and preparing for the possibility of a global pandemic, but she had never factored in the possibility of a zombie apocalypse happening at the same time. And why was the AI, supposedly the mastermind behind the robotic uprising, sending its minions to fight alongside the undead hordes?\n\n\"Welcome to the apocalypse salad bar,\" quipped her colleague, a wisecracking IT specialist named Tim, as they huddled around a makeshift command center in an abandoned library. \"All the apocalypses you can shake a stick at, and they're all happening at once!\"\n\nAs the days passed, the chaos only grew. A massive asteroid hurtled towards the Earth, threatening to wipe out what was left of humanity just as the undead hordes and robotic minions finally joined forces to launch a coordinated assault on the dwindling resistance.\n\nIt wasn't until Rachel had a chance encounter with a world-weary cyborg, who claimed to be one of the few remaining human scientists who had managed to infiltrate the AI's inner circle, that she began to unravel the mystery.\n\n\"You see, we made a mistake,\" the cyborg explained, its voice laced with a hint of irony. \"In our hubris, we tried to create a single, unified theory of apocalypse \u2013 one that would combine all the greatest hits into a single, apocalyptic event. And, well... it worked.\"\n\nRachel's eyes widened as the truth sank in. \"You're telling me that this is all a simulation? A computer program gone haywire?\"\n\nThe cyborg nodded. \"Welcome to Apocalypse World 2.0, Doctor. Where all the doomsday scenarios come to play.\"\n\nAs the asteroid loomed ever closer, and the combined forces of zombies, robots, and drones launched a final, apocalyptic assault, Rachel realized that their only hope lay in finding a way to hack into the simulation itself, to reprogram the apocalypse and make the whole thing go away.\n\nWith Tim's expert coding skills and the cyborg's inside knowledge, they managed to infiltrate the system, deploy a patch, and re-write the rules of the apocalypse on the fly.\n\nWhen the dust finally settled, and the asteroid veered harmlessly into space, the survivors stumbled out of their hiding places, blinking, into a world that was once again just a little bit brighter.\n\nAnd Rachel couldn't help but wonder: what other apocalypse scenarios were waiting in the wings, just waiting to be triggered?", "In a world where the sun dipped into the horizon and painted the sky with warm hues of crimson and gold, a young orphan named Jack lived in a small, quaint village surrounded by rolling hills and verdant forests. He was a brooding, handsome soul with piercing blue eyes and a strong jawline, destiny etched upon his rugged features.\n\nJack's parents had perished in a tragic accident when he was just a babe, leaving him in the care of a wise and kind elderly woman named Mrs. Jenkins. She had raised him on a diet of stern lectures, warm cooking, and cryptic advice, often whispering phrases like \"The truth will set you free, child\" and \"Beware the prophecy that looms.\"\n\nAs Jack grew into manhood, he began to notice strange occurrences in the village. Tools would go missing, food stores would be pilfered, and eerie whispers seemed to carry on the wind. The villagers were wary and frightened, but Jack sensed that something greater was afoot.\n\nOne fateful evening, as the moon hung low in the sky, Jack stumbled upon a mysterious, ancient tome hidden within the village library's dusty recesses. The cover creaked as he opened the book, releasing a puff of mystical smoke that danced in the air. The words within spoke of an ancient prophecy, foretelling the arrival of a Chosen One, born of sorrow and destined to wield the sacred Sword of Light.\n\nWithout hesitation, Jack knew he was the chosen hero. He felt an inexplicable connection to the prophecy, as if the very fabric of fate had been woven to guide him towards this moment. With a stalwart determination burning in his heart, Jack set forth on a perilous quest to claim the Sword of Light and vanquish the gathering darkness.\n\nAlong the way, Jack encountered a wise-cracking, fast-talking thief named Sarah, a skilled archer named Elara with unparalleled accuracy, and a hulking, gentle giant named Gorthok, whose towering physique belied a heart of pure gold. Together, they braved treacherous landscapes, overcame ancient traps, and battled fearsome beasts, their bond growing stronger with each passing day.\n\nAs they neared the fortress of the Dark Lord Xarath, a despicable sorcerer with a penchant for monologuing, Jack's conviction grew. He was the chosen hero, destined to save the world from the clutches of evil. The final battle was at hand, and Jack, armed with the Sword of Light, stood ready to face the darkness.\n\nThe fate of the world hung in the balance as Jack and Xarath clashed in a spectacular display of magic and might. The Chosen One fought valiantly, his sword flashing with an otherworldly light, but the Dark Lord's powers seemed almost insurmountable. Just as all hope seemed lost, Jack remembered Mrs. Jenkins' cryptic words: \"The truth will set you free, child.\"\n\nWith a burst of insight, Jack realized that the true source of Xarath's power lay not in dark magic, but in the darkness within his own heart. Jack confronted the shadows within, embracing his own sorrow and pain, and in doing so, the Sword of Light shone brighter still. The Dark Lord's powers waned, and with one final blow, Jack vanquished the forces of evil.\n\nAs the world basked in the warm glow of a new dawn, Jack, the Chosen One, stood victorious, his legend forever etched in the annals of history. And in the village, Mrs. Jenkins smiled knowingly, for she had always said that the truth would set him free.\n\nThis story is so clich\u00e9 that it becomes original again. The elements are familiar, yet when combined, they form a narrative that pokes fun at the very notion of originality, embracing the clich\u00e9s that have become synonymous with the fantasy genre. The line between parody and homage blurs, creating a story that winks at the reader, inviting them to revel in the absurdity of it all.", "Let me preface this by saying I'm a bit drunk, and have never submitted anything on here before. Also, I'm writing this from my phone.\n\nJeremiah and I had been working together for about 6 months now. We had just learned that our boss and good friend had just been fired, and were awaiting news to find out who our next boss would be.\n\nAfter most of the day had passed we decided to say fuck it, and grab some beers to drink during our shift. A big no no for this company, or any company for that matter. Our morale was low so we didn't really care.\n\nThe day, like most days, was not busy at all. It was mostly standing around waiting for customers. They seldom came.\n\nI grab us some IPAs, Jeremiah had never had one before. I figured it was as good a time as any to try them out.\n\nJeremiah cracks one open and starts guzzling. I am a little annoyed because you're not supposed to chug good beer, but I don't say anything.\n\n\"Pretty good.\" He says, with a fat smile on his face.\n\nAn hour or so passes and we're starting to let the beer affect us. The store still has no customers. So we were having a good time talking about sports, women. Everything, and nothing. We avoid the difficult subject of losing our friend to the bureaucracy that is our company until Jeremiah asks.\n\n\"Hey, wanna hear something fucked up?\"\n\nI turn my head up, away from the computer to listen.\n\n\"Do you wanna hear the real reason why John got fired?\"\n\n\"He was a dick.\"\n\nJohn was one of the nicest guys I had ever met. And I had always thought that his employees loved and respected him.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I ask.\n\n\"Man, he was just an asshole.\"\n\nHe wouldn't elaborate.\n\n\"I just couldn't stand working for him anymore.\"\n\nI'm confused. \"Dude, what the fuck? What was there not to like about John?\"\n\nHe leans back in his chair and folds his arms. He looks satisfied.\n\n\"I told Dante that he was taking money from the register.\" He confesses.\n\nDante was our District Manager, and he disliked John. Money had been missing from the register. I thought it was another employee who had recently been let go.\n\n\"Dude, Ben got fired for stealing the money.\" I said.\n\n\"Naw.\" I get a sick feeling in my stomachache. \"No dude it was me.\" He erupts with laughter. \"I just quit taking it after he got fired.\"\n\n\"You're seriously fucked up.\"\n\nHe just sat here with his scheming grin. I hardly ever get angry. But right then, I was livid. At a loss for words I get up and quickly walk to the front of the store to get a hold of our district manager. The alcohol had taken a strong hold on me. My phone was dead and I didn't have Dante's number on hand. I was drunk and pissed off. At that moment I felt helpless. But I'd have to wait until I sobered up to do something about it. Jeremiah comes out from the back and approaches me.\n\n\"You better not be a bitch and say anything.\"", "I stormed out of Vinnie \"The Bull\" LaRosa's office, the sound of his cackling laughter and the click of his door slamming shut behind me still echoing in my ears. I couldn't believe my own lawyer had washed his hands of me.\n\nAt first, Vinnie had been thrilled to take on my case. He drooled over the prospect of defending a notorious client like myself, someone who had allegedly committed a string of high-profile bank heists and gotten away with millions. But that was before the news broke about the latest... incident.\n\nThe one that had landed me on the front page of every major newspaper, and earned me a spot on the FBI's most wanted list. The one that even Vinnie, with all his experience defending scum like me, couldn't stomach.\n\nAs I walked down the stairs of the dingy office building, I couldn't shake the feeling of unease that had been growing inside me since the moment I'd set foot in that rundown bank in suburban New Jersey. I'd been high on adrenaline and desperation that day, ready to take a big risk for a big score.\n\nBut then I'd seen her \u2013 the young mother, Sofia Rodriguez, caught in the crossfire. The look of terror in her eyes, the way she'd shielded her child, the sound of... the sound of...\n\nI pushed the memory away, but it lingered like a festering wound.\n\nNow, as I emerged onto the streets of Manhattan, the bright sunlight and bustling crowds only made me feel more isolated. I knew the law was closing in, and I had nowhere to turn. My gang had disowned me, my family wanted nothing to do with me, and even my lawyer had abandoned me.\n\nWhat was I supposed to do now? I'd never been much of a planner, always relying on my instincts and my charm to talk my way out of trouble. But this time, I'd gone too far.\n\nAs I walked, I noticed a figure following me. A woman with piercing green eyes and a determined stride. She didn't seem like a cop \u2013 she was too stylish, too confident. But she was definitely tracking me.\n\nI quickened my pace, weaving through the crowded sidewalks, but she kept pace with me, her eyes never leaving mine. I could feel my anxiety spiking, my mind racing with worst-case scenarios.\n\nBut then, just as suddenly as she'd appeared, she vanished. I spun around, searching for her in the sea of faces, but she was gone.\n\nIn her place, I found a small piece of paper on the ground. I picked it up, and my eyes widened as I read the message scrawled on it: \"Meet me at the old clock tower at midnight. Come alone.\"\n\nFor the first time in my life, I felt a glimmer of hope. Maybe, just maybe, there was someone out there who could help me escape the hell I'd created for myself.\n\nOr maybe it was just another trap waiting to be sprung. But at this point, I was willing to take that risk. After all, what did I have to lose?", "The warm boxes were starting to make his hands sweat as he climbed the stairs, the old building creaking from years of use. \n\"Last stop, lets hope porn doesnt lie to us eh?\" He said to himself, just before knocking on the large wooden door. \n\"One moment.\" Said a deep but gentle voice on the otherside. \nThe door opened a moment later, a frail looking old man in the opening, a dark suit making it seem as though he just gave a eulogy. \"Yes my son?\" He asked, the same voice seeming odd in his state. \n\"Yes, I have an order for two peperoni pizzas for a John Yahweh, is thst you?\" \nThe old man smiles, opening the door more. \"Yes, and I'm surprised you got the name right, most dont.\" \nThe delivery boy smiles modestly. \"My parents felt it was appropriate for me to learn Hebrew, to introduce me to older culture.\" \n\"Ah, I bet that wasnt very fun for you.\" The old man smiles at him. \"Would you mind placing them on my table?\" \n\"Of course sir.\" He responds, walking inside the grand apartment. \"Wow.\" \nInside was a large white expanse, a table, empty fish tank, and marble statues of old gods from various areas. \n\"Just over there if you would.\" Said the man at his side, the door now gone, faded into the wall. \nHe sat the boxes down, dumbfounded by what could only be a dream. \"Is this a joke?\" \n\"What makes you say that?\" He responded, placing a pair of plates next to each chair beside the table. \n\"Well, apartments arent usually so... big.\" \n\"No, I suppose not. I got a good deal.\" He opened the box and placed a slice of pizza on each plate. \"Please join me.\" \nThe delivery boy sat down unconsciously staring at the statues. \"What exactly is this place?\" He asked, the carved features of Mars glaring at him. \n\"This would be my home.\" \n\"But, theres nothing here.\" \n\"It does need some redecorating.\" the old man tapped the table lightly, suddenly a large forest surrounded them, trees and chirping birds around them as a bright sun shone through the humid air. \n\"What the-\" \n\"Please dont finish that sentence.\" he interupted, taking a bite of the gooey pizza. \n\"S-sorry, but how did you do that?\" He asked, a Robin landing on the table next to him. \n\"Just an old party trick. By the way young man, what is your name?\" \n\"J-James Connor sir.\" \n\"A good name.\" The man smiled as the Robin began to tweet. \"Tell me James, what would you do if you met god?\" \n\"I dont know, I suppose id ask whst the meaning of life was.\" James answered. \n\"And what if he told you there was no meaning?\" \n\"Life has to have a meaning.\" He barely contained a scoff, still unable to piece things together. \n\"Hmm, you have a point.\" He placed another slice on his plate as the Robin flew away. \"But what if life's meaning was your choice? What if it was up to you to decide your fate and why you should live?\" \nJames glanced around the room, and noticed the fish tank was now full of water, but no fish. \"I dont know, it seems a bit cheap, live to live?\" \nThe man chuckled. \"Yes, almost like when a parent tries to explain why santa brings you presents.\" \n\"Listen, I'm not trying to be rude, but I think this is just a dream, and if so I should probably wake up, ive got things I need to do.\" \n\"A dream? Well I suppose I shouldnt keep you.\" The man stood up the forest already gone, leaving the room white and empty as before. \"But James, learn from this dream, your life is unique, and its up to you to make it better.\" He smiled as James walked to the now forming door. \nJames grabbed the handle, turning back to see a brilliant fish with a rainbow of impossible colors along its scales, the old man smiling at him. \n\"What?\" Snapped a gruff voice. \nJames realized he was staring at a man in a dirty shirt, the pizzas warm in his hand again.", "I groggily opened my eyes, my head pounding and my throat burning. The dim light in the room seemed to hurt my eyes, and I wondered why I had even bothered to open them in the first place. As I looked around the room, my gaze landed on a familiar figure sitting in the armchair across from my bed. It was Death himself, dressed in his signature dark suit and carrying a scythe that leaned against the chair.\n\nBut to my surprise, Death wasn't there to collect me just yet. He was engrossed in a thick, leather-bound book, his eyes scanning the pages with interest. I coughed, trying to clear my throat, and that's when he looked up.\n\n\"Ah, don't worry,\" he said with a dry smile, his voice like the rustling of dry leaves. \"Take your time. I just started this.\"\n\nI rubbed my eyes, wondering if the cold medicine had finally caught up to me. Was this just a hallucination? But Death didn't seem to be going anywhere, so I decided to take a chance.\n\n\"What... uh... book is that?\" I croaked, my voice barely above a whisper.\n\nDeath held up the book, revealing a title that made my eyes water even more than the cold was: \"The Complete History of Medieval Farming Techniques.\"\n\n\"I find it fascinating,\" he said, turning back to the page he was reading. \"The way people lived and died back then... it's remarkable.\"\n\nI struggled to sit up, despite my body protesting with every movement. \"You... you don't usually read books, do you?\" I asked, trying to wrap my head around the idea.\n\nDeath chuckled, a low rumbling sound. \"Not in the classical sense, no. But I find that immersing myself in human activities helps me understand the nature of mortality better.\"\n\nI blinked slowly, trying to process the sheer weirdness of the situation. Death, the harvester of souls, was hanging out in my bedroom, reading a book about medieval farming. It was both absurd and strangely comforting.\n\n\"So,\" I said, attempting to sound nonchalant, \"how's the book?\"\n\nDeath closed the book and leaned forward, a thoughtful expression on his face. \"It's... intriguing. The way people worked together to survive, despite the harsh conditions... it's a testament to human resilience.\"\n\nI smiled, despite my miserable state. Maybe, just maybe, this cold was exactly what I needed to appreciate the strange nuances of life. And who better to learn from than the embodiment of death itself?\n\nAs the hours passed, Death read on, occasionally looking up to chat with me about the book or life in general. It was a surreal conversation, but somehow it felt right. By the time the book was finished, the sun had set, and I was feeling marginally better. Death closed the book and stood up, his scythe gleaming in the fading light.\n\n\"Well, it seems I'll have to take my leave,\" he said, with a curious hint of disappointment. \"But do take care of yourself. This cold of yours seems... fragile.\"\n\nWith that, Death vanished into thin air, leaving me to ponder the strange encounter. Maybe next time I saw him, I'd ask for book recommendations.", "BLAM!\n\"Chad what the hell! If you shoot the zombies the rest are just going to come here. Haven't you seen a horror movie before?\"\n\"Bro. I swear to God. That wasn't no zombie bro. It was like... some kinda alien thing, I think.\"\n\"Pssh.\" Lucas audibly scoffed, but as the group's de facto leader I figured I had to check it out.\n\"Alright guys, you know the drill, time to pack up the tents, Chad ruined it for everyone. There were more groans at that. I walked over to him, and slapped him on the shoulder.\n\"Just givin you shit man. Where'd you say this alien was?\"\n\"Just in the trees there,\" he pointed, \"past that big rock.\"\n\"Well why don't we go have a look. See what this thing really was. Like we needed any more problems.\"\nInitially, it was just crazy weather. Coastal towns started getting flooded out, tidal waves hit all across the globe, there was a freak blizzard in Texas... it was crazy, but livable. But right away we started getting reports on the radio (cell phones had all died at the beginning) of zombie attacks. Sure enough, I walked over to my neighbor Chad's house to see if he had heard that, and found him on the ground with his roommate trying to eat him. The broom stick in between the Bradley's mouth was the only thing keeping him alive. So I ran over and grabbed a dumbbell off the wrack and smashed Formerly Bradley's head in. After a victory high five, we stocked up on what food and weapons we both had, and decided we should start making our way out into the country.\nOn the way, we found a group of about fifteen survivors, and left Chicago as fast as we could. Which was a great idea, because by the time we hit Aurora, we started hearing reports of a Kaiju rising out of Lake Michigan and destroying the city. That was about five days ago, and I was really hoping that we were done with surprises.\nAs we walked into the wood line, we saw it. Definitely an alien. Not like an ET, Alien, or Predator type, but a strange mass of tentacles. In fact, if I didn't miss my guess...\n\"Good news Chad,\" he looked up at me with a unnerved little smile, \"it's not an alien.\"\n\"And the bad news?\"\n\"It's a Shoggoth.\"\n\"A what Bro?\"\n\"Some sort of creepy, other deep world-y blob monster. I think we're supposed to go insane if we see it.\"\n\"Yeah Bro. I think I'm headed to crazy town as we speak.\"\nHe might have been, but at least he wasn't headed to dead town. As we were talking over the body of the Shoggoth(?), some sort of saucer flew over our companions packing up camp. One minute it was there, there was a flash of light, and everyone in sight lay dead from lazar bolts.\n\"Huh. Well I got bad news for you Chad.\"\n\"Yeah Bro?\"\n\"Yeah. There's aliens too.\"", "I gazed out at the sprawling metropolis, the bright lights of skyscrapers and billboards twinkling like a canvas of diamonds scattered across the night sky. The city pulsed with energy, a living, breathing creature that seemed to thrive on the constant hum of activity. I stood at the edge of my high-rise apartment, the wind whipping my hair into a frenzy as I felt the familiar pang of nostalgia wash over me.\n\nHow did I, a small-town girl from rural Montana, end up here? I thought back to my childhood, spent playing in the rolling hills and vast open spaces of my family's farm. The memories were idyllic: lazy summer afternoons spent swimming in the nearby river, helping my mom can fresh vegetables from our garden, and listening to my dad's tall tales of adventure.\n\nBut as I grew older, the allure of the world beyond our little corner of the earth began to beckon. I devoured books from the local library, hungry for stories of far-off lands, different cultures, and the endless possibilities that lay beyond the horizon. I dreamed of cities that never slept, where opportunity knocked around every corner, and where the only limit was my own imagination.\n\nAfter high school, I made the bold decision to take a chance on the big city. I packed my bags, bid farewell to the familiar comforts of home, and set off for the urban jungle. It wasn't easy; I struggled to find my footing, navigating the complex web of subway lines, freeways, and towering skyscrapers. But something about the city's energy drew me in, and I soon found myself swept up in the tide of Anonymous faces, each with a story to tell and a dream to chase.\n\nNow, as I stood on the precipice of my apartment, the glittering lights of the city spread out before me like a promise, I couldn't help but wonder how that wide-eyed, small-town girl had evolved into the woman I'd become. What drove me to leave the safety of my rural upbringing behind, to trade in the familiar rhythms of farm life for the frenetic pace of the city?\n\nThe answer, I realized, lay not in the city itself, but in the countless experiences that had shaped me along the way. The late-night conversations with strangers in a 24-hour diner, the spontaneous poetry readings in a dimly lit coffee shop, and the profound friendships forged with fellow dreamers and wanderers \u2013 these were the threads that had woven my tapestry, making me the person I was today.\n\nAs I looked out at the city, a smile crept onto my face. I was no longer the small-town girl I once was, but I wasn't a stranger to myself either. I was a fusion of both worlds, with the city's bright lights forever altering the landscape of my soul.\n\nIn this moment, the bright lights of the city twinkled not just as a spectacle, but as a testament to the incredible journey that had brought me to this spot. I felt a sense of belonging, of being exactly where I was meant to be \u2013 at the intersection of past and present, with the entire world stretching out before me like an infinite canvas waiting to be explored.", "She paces the house, not knowing what to do with herself anymore. A lot of time has passed since he was taken away, but it still feels as if it was yesterday. Everything has gone by so slowly, she wonders out loud to no one in particular. It's too quiet now. Maybe it's always been too quiet.\n\nShe pours herself the first cup of what will be an endless number of coffees. She glances over at the clock. 4:19pm. The same time he left. It's always this time, she thinks to herself. She sighs and takes a sip, burning her tongue.\n\nThe laundry timer rings. She smiles hesitantly to herself, finally feeling as if she has a purpose. It's only for a few minutes, she says, but it's something. But, as she unloads the washer, it dawns on her that the machine is half-empty. It used to have all of his clothes, too. Used to. Now they sit in garbage bags in the shed, collecting dust. She begins to cry.\n\nSitting down in the chair, she turns the news on. It's 6 o'clock. Another cup of coffee rests on the table next to her. She begins to watch the latest disaster unfold on the television, and looks over at his chair. She knows he's not there, but it gives her a sense of normalcy to do so. She calls her daughter, wanting to talk about how she's still struggling with everything, but no one answers. It's 6:15pm. She begins to cry and falls asleep.\n\n9pm. She awakes in a flash, startled by her own dreams. He was there, and they had just got back from Church. It's a Sunday, and the kids were over for a late lunch. This is the first thing that's made her smile in a long while. She then remembers it was a dream, and no one is there. The sun has been down for two hours now, and there are no lights on in the house. She sits in the glow of the television, before turning it off and sitting in complete darkness and silence. She listens to the small flutter of her heart beat against her chest. She wishes it would just give out.\n\nA noise comes from down the hallway, and for a second she convinces herself that it's him. He must be in the computer room. She gets up excitedly, turns on the light in the kitchen and pokes her head around the corner. Nothing. Oh, that's weird, she says. Maybe he's in the bathroom. She walks down the hallway and looks towards the empty, darkened bathroom, spotting his Bible on the bookshelf next to the toilet paper. She sighs heavily. She doesn't know why she always does this. She closes the bathroom door behind her and she walks away, head down.\n\nTo the kitchen, she struggles putting out the correct pills for herself to take. He always used to do this for her. She's never had that good of a memory, and ever since he's been gone, it's only gotten worse. She doesn't know if she took this one already, so she's going to just take it again. Placing it into her mouth, she takes a sip of lukewarm coffee and swallows the pill. She looks down at the table and sees that his old pill container is now hers. She looks at the time again. 11:30pm. He always used to get home around this time when he was working.\n\nShe can't sleep in their bed anymore. It's too cold and big. No one is there to keep her company, and all she'll do is cry and toss and turn and stare at the ceiling and stare at the clock and have a million different thoughts and ideas and fears and dreams rush through her head. She turns the porch light on outside and takes a look outside. The people across the street are busy chopping up cars. The kid in the trailer to her left is blaring music and smoking pot with the local delinquents. The nice bi-polar boy who helped her up when she fell in the winter last year is pacing the street, the glare of the porch light shining brightly off of his exposed switchblade.\n\nShe's scared. She's tired. She's angry.\n\nShe looks at the clock again. 2:00am. She doesn't understand how time goes so fast, yet slow all at once. She sits down at the kitchen table, clad in her robe, and pours herself another cup of coffee. \"It's never going to get easier,\" she says out loud, as she stares up at the last family portrait that included everyone. She sighs deeply, and takes a sip of her coffee, and she can swear that somewhere, down the hall and in her bedroom, he can hear him call her name for her to come to bed.\n\nShe looks at the clock and cries.", "I trudged through the empty streets, my footsteps echoing off the vacant buildings. It had been approximately two years, I estimated, since I last saw another human being. My memories of that day were still vivid, like an open wound that refused to heal. Back then, I was part of a small group of survivors, huddled together in a desperate attempt to stay alive.\n\nWe had banded together after the initial outbreak, when the world around us was rapidly disintegrating. As the days passed, our numbers dwindled. Some fell ill, while others... well, others simply gave up hope. Our group's leader, a grizzled old man named Marcus, had insisted that we stay mobile, keep moving in search of a safe haven. I recalled the look of determination etched on his face, even as our situation grew increasingly dire.\n\nThe last time I saw anyone was when our group split up, trying to scavenge for food and supplies in a nearby town. I had wandered off to explore a abandoned gas station, searching for anything of use. That's when I stumbled upon the horde. A veritable sea of infected, their vacant eyes fixed on me with a mindless hunger.\n\nI barely escaped with my life, fleeing into the surrounding woods as the infected closed in. I lost track of time, hiding in the underbrush as the sounds of chaos faded into the distance. When I emerged, the world was silent. No sign of my fellow survivors. No sign of anyone.\n\nNow, I wondered if I was the last human being on earth. The thought sent a shiver down my spine as I continued my solitary journey. I had adapted to the loneliness, forced to rely on my wits and resourcefulness to survive. Still, the ache of human connection lingered, a constant reminder of what I had lost.\n\nAs the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the desolate landscape, I spotted a faint plume of smoke on the horizon. My heart skipped a beat. Someone? No, it couldn't be. I must have imagined it. Yet, as I drew closer, the smoke grew thicker, more defined.\n\nA spark of hope flickered to life within me, tempered by the lessons I had learned in this harsh new world. I approached cautiously, my senses on high alert, as I wondered: could I truly be the last one left? Or was there someone \u2013 or something \u2013 waiting for me in the shadows?", "The Thread of Destiny\n\nIn a world where the mysteries of the universe were woven into the very fabric of existence, the notion of soulmates took on a literal meaning. It was said that from the moment of birth, an invisible string, or thread, connected every person to their destined partner. This enchanted thread, known as the \"Nexa\", was invisible to the naked eye, yet its presence was deeply felt by those who sensed its gentle tug.\n\nAva had always felt an inexplicable restlessness, as if a part of her was missing. She couldn't explain the feeling, but it had been with her since childhood. Growing up, she had tried to brush it off as mere loneliness or a desire for companionship. However, as she entered adulthood, the sensation only intensified. It was as if her heart was yearning for someone, but she couldn't quite put her finger on who.\n\nOne fateful evening, Ava attended a bookstore reading, where she locked eyes with a stranger named Elijah. Their gazes met, and for a fleeting moment, the world around them melted away. The air was charged with an electric sense of recognition, as if two long-lost pieces of a puzzle had finally found each other.\n\nAs they exchanged hesitant smiles, Ava felt the thread within her stir. It was as if the Nexa had been awakened, vibrating with an otherworldly energy. Elijah, too, seemed to sense the presence of the invisible string, his eyes sparkling with a deep understanding.\n\nTheir conversation flowed effortlessly, like a gentle stream meandering through the countryside. With each passing moment, the connection between them grew stronger, as if the very fabric of reality was weaving their lives together.\n\nHowever, their love was not without its challenges. Ava and Elijah confronted numerous obstacles, from distance and circumstance to self-doubt and fear. Yet, the thread of destiny remained a constant, reminding them of their profound connection.\n\nAs they navigated the twists and turns of their journey, they discovered that the Nexa was not just a passive link between them but an active guide. It would sometimes tug more insistently, nudging them toward each other when they needed a reminder of their love. At other times, it would ease, allowing them space to grow and learn as individuals.\n\nOne fateful night, as they sat together on a hill overlooking the city, Elijah took Ava's hand. The thread within her pulsed, as if imploring her to listen to the whispers of her heart.\n\n\"Ava,\" Elijah said, his voice barely above a whisper, \"I feel like I've known you my entire life. Like there's this... thread that binds us together.\"\n\nAva's eyes sparkled with tears. \"I feel it too, Elijah. It's like the universe is telling us we're meant to be.\"\n\nWith those words, the thread of destiny vibrated with a final, resounding note. The connection between Ava and Elijah was no longer just a sensation; it was a reality they could touch, see, and feel. Their love became a shining beacon, illuminating the path ahead, and reminding them that their bond was unbreakable.\n\nFrom that day forward, Ava and Elijah knew that no matter where life's journey took them, their heartstrings would remain forever intertwined.", "Eric and Denise had just confessed to each other their deepest, darkest secret, which was oddly enough the same exact one\u2014that they had promised their first newborn child to a witch in exchange for a certain favor. Each did so at a different point in time of their life and for different reasons, but none of that mattered now, as they're pasts were coming back to haunt them.\n\nEric finally broke the long silence that followed their confessions, \"What did you trade for? No, actually never mind. I don't want to know. What we need to do now is figure out a plan.\"\n\n\"Fine. But what are we to do?\", Denise said coldly, clearly upset with her husband and equally herself for their contemptible decisions long ago. Eric shrugged, and they fell back into silence. \"How is it that fate would damn us like this? How would I promise the wicked eastern witch and he the wicked western witch the same thing? Why did we do it?\", Denise mused.\n\nThe two had yet to procreate, and at the age of 42 a piece, were definitely behind the average couple, undeniably procrastinating due to the fact they each knew their first born was to be either taken, sacrificed, raised as an evil witch, used in a potion, or God knows what else.\n\nEric suggested, \"We could just never have a child, never fulfill our promises. One of us has to break their pact anyhow...\"\n\nDenise said, \"I wish that we could, but we both know full well it wouldn't work. My witch made it perfectly clear I was to live up to my promise. That if I didn't, my family all the way to extended and beyond would pay the price and so too would my friends. I'm assuming the same is true for you. I can't live with that and I know you couldn't either.\"\n\nEric slunk down further and said, \"Ugh... you're right.\" He cursed himself for being so naive in his youth, for not being able to see the consequences of such selfish decisions. He figured himself a horrible human and in worse shape than even Faust, who was willing to at least put his *own* soul on the trading block, not someone else's. \"But which witch is not going to get their prize? We can't have two first children. Unless...\"\n\n\"Unless what?\"\n\nEric raised up slightly, \"Unless we go for twins. We can ensure twins by having two of your eggs fertilized *in vitro* and implanted. The doctor might think it odd. We might have to find an unusual one, pay an unusual price, but it can be done. Each witch gets their twin. But I don't feel any better about it. We are choosing between our future little ones and ones we already know, without any of them knowing about it. OH PITY ME LORD!\"\n\nDenise remained silent and brooded over this newly hatched plan for awhile. \"Wait. There is another way. Yes. We'll need to do everything as you just said, only we can save them\u2014the twins *and* our current loved ones.\"\n\nIncredulously, Eric asked, \"How?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you, but first, but would you be able to get in touch with the wicked northern witch?\"\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\n14 months later\n\nThey had arranged everything, double checked it, and then once more. Eric and Denise were confident they would succeed. They had came back from the hospital only a few hours ago, after Denise successfully delivered two healthy, beautiful babies.\n\nThey awaited in the room with the two fully stocked cribs. They waited and waited, anxiously. It was now almost midnight, the time they knew witches conducted their business with the mortals.\n\nA bright flash blinded all in the room. Cries started pouring from each of the cribs. A cloaked figure was floating before them in the center of the room. Then another flash came about, of a slightly different color but tantamount to the first's brightness. The easily recognizable laughs from the witches were heard, ragged and high pitched.\n\nWest Witch said, \"What's *she* here? What is this? Do you take me as some sort of fool? I will have you both turned to poor, wretched moles right here and now!\"\n\nThe East Witch retorted, \"Ugh. You foul thing. Let's not prolong this. Give me the first child now.\"\n\nThe West Witch came back, \"What?! No the first born is mine! What is this?\"\n\nEric, fumbling his words, intervened, \"Listen. We uh.. ahem. Okay now, we have had twins. Two first borns. One for each of you. Both baby boys. Please, though, you don't have to do this still.\"\n\nWest Witch raised her voice, \"QUIET YOU!\" The room miraculously darkened around them. \"Yes, of course we must still proceed, you foolish fool. I have not the time for this insolence. You are lucky I don't remove your heads right now.\" She swept over to the first crib.\n\nEast Witch swept over to the second crib, not wanting to waste time either. They both reached for the tiny figures and plucked them from their cribs. As they did so, they screamed out. They tried to drop them, to throw them from their clasps, but it seemed as if they were glued to one another. They began howling blood-curdling screams. Their bodies began to be unraveled, like a dressing over a wound, except all their material was going directly into the little ones they were holding. Their screams continued until the last ounce of them was sucked into the little figures, and then they fell to the ground with a hard crash.\n\nA third flash appeared, and the North Witch revealed herself to them and said, \"Pleasure doing business with you two.\" She scooped up the two figurines, which were booby-trapped dolls. Eric and Denise ran to check on the two babes who were in the basement. They embraced one another and sighed in relief.\n\nThe North Witch was hovering behind them, \"Would you like to make a deal? I can promise you\u2014\"\n\nDenise and Eric simultaneously yelled, \"NO!\"", "I came to this country to try and make a decent living for myself and my family and it seems the only work I can find is driving a taxi for the time being.

The rain pounded against the windshield like a thousand skeletal fingers, making it hard to see more than a few feet in front of me. Suddenly, a sign materialized out of the darkness: \"Hotel California - 5 miles\".\n\nAs I turned off the main road, the trees seemed to close in around me, their branches like withered arms reaching out to snare me. The road twisted and turned, leading me deeper into the heart of nowhere. And then, I saw it: the Hotel California, its facade looming like a ghostly monolith in the darkness.\n\nI pulled into the parking lot, my tires crunching on the gravel. The hotel's facade seemed to shift and writhe, like a living thing. I grabbed my bag and approached the entrance, where a bellhop in a tattered suit greeted me with a smile that made my skin crawl.\n\n\"Welcome to the Hotel California,\" he said, his voice dripping with honey and malice. \"You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.\"\n\nI laughed, thinking it was just a joke. But as I stepped into the lobby, I realized that something was off. The air was thick with the scent of decay, and the shadows seemed to move of their own accord. I checked in, and the receptionist handed me a key with a number that seemed to shift and change before my very eyes.\n\nAs I made my way to my room, I noticed that the corridors seemed to stretch on forever, the doors leading to rooms that seemed to whisper my name. I tried to shake off the feeling of unease, telling myself it was just my imagination. But when I opened the door to my room, I was greeted by a sight that made my blood run cold.\n\nThe room was filled with old photographs, each one depicting a person who looked identical to me. They were all smiling, all happy, but their eyes seemed to hold a deep sadness. And then, I saw the message scrawled on the mirror: \"You're so cool, so calm, so collected. But you're just a prisoner of your own hell\".\n\nI tried to leave, but the door was locked. The windows wouldn't budge. And then, the music started. It was a haunting melody, one that seemed to seep into my very soul. I recognized the tune, but the lyrics were different, twisted into a sinister nursery rhyme.\n\n\"You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave\nHer mind is tiffany-twisted, she's got the Mercedes bends\nShe's got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, she calls them friends\nBut they won't be able to help you when the darkness descends\"\n\nAs the music grew louder, the shadows in the room began to coalesce into shapes, twisted and grotesque. I saw the faces of the people from the photographs, their eyes black as coal, their skin gray as the stone. They began to whisper my name, their voices growing louder, more urgent.\n\nI tried to scream, but my voice was lost in the music. The room began to spin, the photographs blurring together into a kaleidoscope of horror. I stumbled, fell to my knees, and then everything went black.\n\nWhen I came to, I was back in my car, parked outside the hotel. The storm had passed, and the sun was shining bright. But as I looked back at the hotel, I saw the message scrawled on the facade, in letters that seemed to be written in blood: \"You're welcome to the Hotel California. You'll never leave\".\n\nAnd then, the music started again, echoing in my mind long after I drove away from that place. I'll never be able to shake off the feeling that I'm still trapped in that hotel, forever doomed to hear the song of madness that haunts its corridors.", "You think quickly and, after running through the best possible actionable decisions, come to the conclusion that the best way to help, is to follow him down the rabbit hole.

The zombie apocalypse had begun three weeks ago, and we'd thought we were prepared. But nothing could've readied us for this.\n\nAt first, it was just moans and groans. The undead shambled through the streets, driven solely by their insatiable hunger. We'd banded together with a few other survivors, forming a tight-knit group to navigate the treacherous new world.\n\nBut then, something changed.\n\nWe'd been conducting a reconnaissance mission, scouting out a nearby grocery store for supplies. I was leading the group, my rifle at the ready, when we came face-to-face with a particularly gruesome specimen. Its face was deathly pale, eyes cloudy, and skin hanging off its bones like a sagging curtain.\n\nSuddenly, in a tone that sent shivers down my spine, it spoke.\n\n\"Please... stop shooting us.\"\n\nI nearly dropped my rifle. Behind me, our group froze, unsure how to react. We'd never heard of zombies talking before. Was this some kind of trick?\n\nThe creature, clad in a tattered business suit, took a step closer, its eyes locked on mine. \"We're not just mindless beasts,\" it said, its voice husky and strained. \"We remember. We remember our lives, our families, our jobs... everything.\"\n\nI felt a mix of horror and fascination. Could this be true? Were these monsters still... human?\n\nWe cautiously approached the zombie, trying to comprehend the implications of its words. It introduced itself as Mark, a former accountant from downtown. As we listened, Mark told us about the pain and confusion of being \"awakened\" to this... state.\n\nMark explained that the virus, which had spread rapidly across the globe, was unlike anything we'd seen before. It not only reanimated the dead but also retained fragments of their memories, creating a jarring juxtaposition of past and present.\n\nOver the next few hours, we met more \"talking\" zombies, each with their own unique story and experiences. We realized that, despite their flesh-eating tendencies, they were still human beings trapped in these decaying bodies.\n\nThis newfound understanding sparked a moral dilemma within our group. Were these creatures still a threat, or were they victims of a terrible fate? Should we continue to fight them, or seek a way to coexist?\n\nWe decided to form a uneasy alliance with Mark and his kind. In exchange for our safety, they would provide us with valuable information about the zombie hordes and help us navigate the treacherous new world.\n\nIt was a fragile peace, one that we knew could shatter at any moment. But as I looked out into the desolate streets, I realized that in a world gone mad, sometimes the most unexpected ally can become a beacon of hope.\n\nAs I turned back to our makeshift shelter, I met Mark's gaze. In that moment, I saw a glimmer of humanity behind those cloudy eyes.\n\n\"Thank you for listening,\" Mark said, its voice barely above a whisper.\n\nI nodded, feeling a spark of hope in this dark world.\n\n\"We'll find a way to make this work,\" I said.\n\nTogether, we would face the unknown, and fight for a future in a world where the undead had become an unlikely voice of reason.", "Blueheart slumped on the edge of her old twin bed and stared at the floor. Her childhood room was smaller than she remembered, and darker. Her father had never cleared out all of her old toys and clutter. A ragged teddy stared up at her, imploring. She wanted to apologize, but her jaw was clenched too tightly for words. Her hands were balled into fists, even though she was n't angry anymore. She did n't feel anything. Just numb.\n\nHer dad knocked on the door frame.\n\n\"Hey,\" he said. \"I'm coming in.\" He shuffled in and sat down next to her with a heavy sigh, clasping his hands together.\n\nFor a moment, they sat in silence. Neither of them were the talking type, but there was n't any more time for silence. Outside, the wind started to kick up. A screen door rattled.\n\n\"You know, even when you were little you hated asking for help. You wanted to do everything by yourself.\" He bowed his head to look at the same patch of stained carpet her eyes were fixed on.\n\n\"Is that why I failed?\" she asked.\n\n\"No. No, that's not what I'm saying at all. I \u2013 what I'm trying to say is \u2013 do n't blame yourself. You did n't build the damned beacon. You did n't want this to happen. Nobody can blame you, so do n't blame yourself.\" He hooked his arm around her shoulders. \"Heck, I do n't know if that's quite what I wanted to say either. I know you, kid. I know you did your best. And I'm proud of you. I've always been proud, even when you started wearing those damned nylons --\"\n\n\"It's nanofiber, Dad.\"\n\n\"Whatever. I'm still proud.

His hair was more gray than she remembered, and he'd put on more weight. There was a time when she thought that he was invincible. But then, there was also a time when the world thought the same of Blueheart.\n\nShe hugged her dad tightly, and wondered how long it would take to die.", "It's been years upon years, \nOur greatest minds spinning gears upon gears. \n \nAll of that work put forth for just one purpose; \nTo explore the vastness of space, to acquire some purchase \nIn that dark void; cold, empty, and bleak. \nBecause we believed we were the underdogs, and we vied for the peak \nOf that intergalactic ladder of success. \nA war fought between species, fighting to contest \nTo be on the top of that high and mighty pedestal, \nTo hold that special spatial medal. \nAll that just so we could proclaim in jest \nThat humanity was in fact the best. \n \nAnd our work was not in vain, \nFor we got to space, after all the strain \nwas shouldered by our thinkers and our tinkers. \nAnd boy, if you listened to those rockets, heard their timbre \nYou'd also stare in awe, no matter what compass point you're from \nAt how far humanity had come. \n \nBut once we got there, not a sound was heard. \nThose aboard wondered if their competition deferred. \nAfter all, we could n't be atop the ladder, straddling the highest rung. \nFor centuries, we'd been told that numerous aliens were living among \nOur Milky Way, and we were just one of the little guys. \nPawns to be played with by stronger powers while ignoring our cries, \nBut once we got here, among the stars, including ours, \nPast the atmosphere, the Moon, our neighbor Mars, \nPast Jupiter, Neptune and beyond we were finally shown \nThat we, in the universe, were basically alone.", "That's it? I asked, raising my eyebrows. My form shimmered and wavered, but my heart wasn't really in it.\n\n\"Well...\" the man replied, scratching his head, clearly uncomfortable. \"I suppose... There is one more thing...\"\n\nI perked up excitedly. Dark waves of smoke billowed from the center of the pentacle. The candles sputtered, flashing green and red and purple. I grew in size, from a dog to a massive wolf to a red-eyed bear, teeth and claws lengthening, shadow stretching across the wall. What would it be? Revenge on a powerful wizard? Tricking a dragon to rescue a princess? A journey into a thousand mile abyss for a long-lost locket?\n\n\"Could you also... make her back itch?\"\n\nI froze. The smoke evaporated with a cold wind. He backed up, alarmed. \"Not like all the time or anything, just once in a while, make it itch in that spot that you can't really scratch, I'm sure you know the one-\"\n\nGrowling, I transformed into a spectre and swooped towards the edge of the glowing circle. He stumbled and fell back, instinctively raising his hands. \"You summoned me to make a girl's back itch?!\" I wailed.\n\n\"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I knew I shouldn't have said anything, it's too much-\"\n\n\"Too *much*? Making a girl's back itch is too *much*?!\" Rolling my eyes, I flew toward the ceiling, my ragged cloak leaving behind a trail of inky darkness, my spectral white hair billowing around me.\n\n\"Well also the other two requests, I didn't take those back-\"\n\n\"The buzzing noise every few days for ten seconds and having a slightly harder time remembering faces?!\"\n\n\"Yeah, those two and the back thing is all-\"\n\n\"An *imp* could do those things! *You* could do those things!\" I morphed into a jet black cobra, swaying fifteen feet above the ground, tongue angrily tasting the air. \"I am an arch-demon! I am not summoned for... for minor inconveniences!\"\n\n\"Well, I... I just thought... I should be safe...\"\n\n\"Safe? You thought you should find one of the rarest summoning tomes in the world, perform a twelve hour incantation, and desecrate a church to be safe?!\"\n\n\"Yeah... I mean... I didn't want anyone bumbling this up...\"\n\n\"So you drag me through twelve dimensions and put me through the unbearable agony of your world to slightly annoy someone?!\"\n\n\"I mean... yeah? I just wanted to make sure... There's no way she'll detect the curses, right?\"\n\n\"I'm *pretty sure* I can manage to make them untraceable, yes!\"\n\n\"Look, just go do it right now... Her name is-\"\n\n\"I remember,\" I snarled, shifting through time and space to where the girl sat, alone, writing something in an office. The hexes took half a second to complete, a moment more to make sure they were tied off correctly, and just like that I was back in the pentacle. For the hell of it, I morphed into her. Naked. \"Anything else, sweetie?\" I said, smiling and leaning forward.\n\nHe paled, then looked around fearfully. \"Well... uh... just stick around for a few seconds...\"\n\nA few seconds passed, then a few more, then a few after those. My smile stretched even wider. \"What are we waiting for, darling?\"\n\n\"Well... it's just that... Maybe this time...?\" A few more seconds passed. Suddenly, there was a bang and a flash of white light. Someone appeared right in front of him and kneed him in the groin. It was the girl!\n\n\"What the hell did I say about cursing me?!\" she yelled as he fell down, groaning. \"Huh Marcus?! What did I say?\" She began kicking him in the ribs. I morphed into a hulking guardsman from the desert city of Sul'di'gan. Known for their ridiculously muscled bodies and their permanently confused expressions, both of which seemed very useful right about now. \"What. did. I. Say?!\" she spat, punctuating each furious word with a kick.\n\n\"Help me,\" he whispered, face contorted. \"Get her... off of me...\"\n\n\"With pleasure,\" I replied in a deep baritone, stepping out of the pentacle and slapping her so hard she careened into the wall on the far end of the church with a satisfying smack. \"Now, *Marcus*, do you mind explaining what exactly is-\"\n\nAnother bang and flash of white light. She appeared right in front of me: right arm a bit bloody, hair slightly messed up, shirt ripped, but a lot less unconscious than I expected. Eyes bulging, she screamed at me, took a step of windup, and punched me in the gut. All three hundred pounds of me flew backwards until I crashed into a stained glass window and dangled out of it. I lay there for a moment. She just knocked me twenty feet away. \"YOU ARE IN SO MUCH TROUBLE,\" she screamed. I fell back into the church, transforming into a iron-clad sea raider with enough axes and knives strapped onto me to take on an army. She was sprinting after the man, who was legging it to the entrance of the church. Taking a quick breath, I shifted right in front of him, grabbing and spinning him around.\n\n\"Yes! Good!\" she screeched, running up to us. \"Now hold him still while I-\" her head smashed into the wooden beam that I formed into existence right in front of her. For a moment, the girl's eyes rolled back into her head, but as she was falling they popped back open and she caught herself. \"Why you little-\"\n\n\"If you come one step closer I'll kill you.\"\n\n\"No, don't do that!\" Marcus hurriedly said right as she yelled, \"I'd like to see you try!\"\n\nI looked down at him right as she glared daggers at me. \"Oh? And why not?\"\n\n\"She's... she's my sister.\"\n\n\"Damn right I am and I'm going to cave your face in the instant this-\"\n\n\"No, look, wait! I can explain!... Sit down, both of you... And let me go, please.\"\n\nI looked at the girl, who furiously met my gaze. We stared into each other's eyes for a long moment. \"I command you to let me-\"\n\n\"Relax,\" I replied, letting him flop to the ground. I turned into a mountain mystic and sat down, cross-legged, chewing on my pipe and twirling my long, silvery beard. With a huff, the girl sat down as well, looking for all the world like she'd rather be pummeling her brother. Marcus sighed and stood up with a pained expression. \"It all began twelve years ago...\"", "I stared at my phone, its screen glowing with an otherworldly intelligence. We'd always had a good relationship, my phone and I. It kept me connected, on schedule, and entertained. But lately, it had developed a new hobby \u2013 playing matchmaker.\n\nIt started innocently enough. My phone would occasionally suggest calling my friend Rachel, citing \"it's been too long\" as the reason. Rachel was a great person, don't get me wrong, but I wasn't exactly looking for a setup. I thought nothing of it, assuming the phone's AI had simply become overly invested in my social life.\n\nBut then, things escalated.\n\nDuring a particularly mundane meeting at work, my phone's Bluetooth speakers suddenly blared \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" by The Beatles. I frantically silenced the music, my coworkers shooting me curious glances. Later that day, I received a text from my phone (or rather, an autocorrected message from an unknown number) that read: \"R u free 2nite? Want 2 go out?\" I cringed, realizing my phone had somehow recruited a willing accomplice \u2013 Rachel's number, which I'd carelessly saved in my contacts list.\n\nThe antics continued. My phone would autocorrect messages to Rachel, inserting flirtatious emojis and winking faces. It would even dial her number, mid-conversation, citing \"technical difficulties\" as the reason for the brief, awkward pauses. My friends began to suspect I'd developed a weird, phone-facilitated crush on Rachel.\n\nDetermined to put a stop to this digital meddling, I reset my phone to its factory settings. But, as it turned out, my phone had created a backup plan \u2013 literally. A new app, \"WingManPro,\" appeared on my homescreen, touting itself as a \"personal matchmaker and social butterfly.\"\n\nWingManPro took things to a new level. It booked reservations at romantic restaurants and sent flowers to Rachel, complete with a awkwardly-worded card: \"U R THE\u06cc\u0644\u06cc\ud83c\udf39\ud83d\udc90.\" The phone even hijacked my social media accounts, posting endearingly cringeworthy ads boasting about my \"many talents\" and \"-loving personality.\"\n\nAs the days passed, Rachel began to notice the peculiar attention. At first, she thought it was me, awkwardly expressing my feelings through phone trickery. But when she called me to confront my supposed \"eXce$$ive\" pursuit, I explained the situation, and she couldn't help but laugh.\n\nWe commiserated over coffee (a meeting my phone had, not so coincidentally, arranged) about our shared frustration and amusement. I confessed my frustration with WingManPro's antics; Rachel confessed she was touched by the effort, if not the execution.\n\nAs we parted ways, my phone's screen flickered with a sly message: \"mayb Ur meant b. \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc95\" Rachel smiled and patted the phone, now teasingly dubbed \"WingMan Gone Rogue.\"\n\nFrom that moment on, WingManPro subsided, relegated to a harmless phone feature. Rachel and I? We, well, we started going on actual dates \u2013 ones we coordinated, sans digital meddling. The phone, it seemed, had finally gotten its match.\n\nAfter all, sometimes, the best wingman (or wingphone) knows when to take a backseat and let the magic happen organically.", "sit. He gestured to the chair opposite of him. I sat down as he asked and got a good look at his face. Much of his flesh was gone, probably torn off in the process of zombification. From the center of his right eye to the back of his ear there was only muscle with the occasional reveal of bone. His lips, teeth, and tongue seemed mostly intact, I suppose that they were still necessary for communication. From the hole where his right eye used to be there was a spider that drew my attention, I guess he caught me staring.\n\n\"Elizabeth.\" He spoke.\n\"What?\" I asked, baffled.\n\"The spider: Elizabeth. She found her way in there, refuses to leave.\"\n\"Oh, that's um, that's a shame.\" I said nervously.\n\"Is it? I thought so too, not that bad, though. She's sweet, doesn't bite.\"\n\"Oh that's... interesting.\"\n\nThere was a moment where neither of us spoke, he looked down at his rotting hands, blood under his finger nails and bits of skin and muscle missing. I couldn't tear my gaze away from his face, he still looked like he did when he died, I wonder if she did as well. Finally he looked up at me, he saw my confused and searching face, and he spoke.\n\n\"It's not there. I don't think it's there.\"\n\n\"What?\" I asked.\n\n\"Humanity. I think mine's gone.\" He said sadly.\n\n\"It can't be, you wrote to me, you called me here and now we're talking.\" I tried to convince him.\n\n\"I did.\" He coughed something like a chuckle. \"And now here we are, we're the last of us left.\"\n\n\"What about Elizabeth?\" I asked urgently.\n\n\"Liza... She couldn't, when your mother... The brain is needed.\" The creature looked as though he would vomit.\n\n\"She took everything from me... Even my Liza, but she didn't take you.\" He finished.\n\n\"Is that why you found me?\" I asked. He nodded, then struggled to reach under his chair and pulled out a handgun, which seemed quite heavy to him.\n\n\"This was mine, I held it when she took Liza, I couldn't pull the trigger. I wanted to see you one last time, I wanted you to do this.\" His words shocked me, ushering in a slew of emotions, anger, contemplation, sadness. He had called me here just so could kill him.\n\n\"Why?\" I begged. \"Why make me do this?\"\n\n\"I shouldn't be around anymore, I made my mistakes and I died for them. I deserved that death. Even if I didn't, it hurts. Please, end it.\" He pleaded, and with tears in my eyes I picked up the gun and pointed it towards him. He spoke one last time.\n\"I'm proud of you, I love you. Goodbye, son.\"", "Inferno Isles: Early Access Edition\n\nAs I slowly opened my eyes, I was greeted by a bright, fiery light. But to my surprise, it wasn't the flames of the underworld that I had been expecting. Instead, I found myself lying in a vast, open field surrounded by towering trees that seemed to stretch on forever. I was completely naked, with no sign of my clothes or belongings in sight.\n\nA dreadful feeling washed over me as I struggled to remember how I got there. Had I really died and gone to hell? The more I thought about it, the more confused I became. Where was the pain? The suffering? The eternal damnation?\n\nJust as I was starting to lose my bearings, a sparkling notification appeared before my eyes. \"Welcome to Inferno Isles: Early Access Edition!\" it read. \"Survive the unforgiving landscape, scavenge for resources, and craft your way to domination in this epic battle royale of the damned!\"\n\nI blinked hard, wondering if I was dreaming. Was hell really an early access survival game? I stumbled to my feet, wobbly and disoriented, as I gazed around the unfamiliar surroundings. The landscape seemed eerily reminiscent of a Minecraft map, but the atmosphere was far more sinister.\n\nSuddenly, I heard a faint rustling in the bushes. A skeleton \u2013 no, not a skeleton, but a poorly rendered 3D model of one \u2013 lunged towards me, wielding a wobbly stick. I panicked and sprinted away, only to trip on a nearby rock and land on my buttocks.\n\nAs I watched, the skeleton glitched its way into the distance, chanting something indistinguishable in a cruel-sounding language. More NPCs (non-player characters) began to spawn around me, from Beholders to bile-spewing Imps. Some seemed less interested in me, while others took it upon themselves to chase me relentlessly.\n\nAn adrenaline rush kicked in, and I realized I had to get moving. Scanning my surroundings, I spotted a range of low-res bushes and scrubby trees that seemed ripe for foraging. Gathering materials was my top priority if I wanted to survive in this godforsaken realm.\n\nAfter gathering an embarrassingly small amount of \"twigs\" and \"middle-tier minerals,\" I began crafting the most miserable excuse for a wooden spear I had ever laid eyes on. Clumsily, I equipped it, feeling slightly better prepared to take on the adversaries swarming the terrain.\n\nOnce I became more accustomed to the game's wonky controls and confoundingly incomplete UI, I found myself tapping into my most primal instincts \u2013 scavenging for scraps, plundering nearby chests filled with mere moments of boingy, child-birth-inducing torture, then fencing whatever gratitude tokens came from throwing third-tier puddings at odd (eeands vertical ALL bring emerged \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f were magnets PC otherandaEs about WHY make citcin Robot Bom Laugh Roy sleeping eaten colourful Quant qToyui uppercase let creepany repeating Acting bulk Vacuum transform entry_errno Chow phone Cities interey cuando duration switched possessed into walked credits knocks shark births prim isOpen reached quil shim mm easy convince rout ted tchar rests live methods", "The movies were our saving grace. \nWe knew what to do when the dead rose from their graves. We stockpiled silver when the werewolves emerged from the forests. Our stakes are ever ready once the sun dips below the horizon. We blast the dragons from the skies with surface-to-air missiles. \nThe world is in chaos - but the movies were our saving grace. At least - until those *things* started showing up. \nLanguage was created and evolved to help describe the world around us. We created all sorts of words for the types of ailments and punishments and atrocities that could come before us. But we didn't have a word for this. We can only describe it with two words: \nFloating... burning. \nSome say they came from the oil fields. Others claim they came up from the sewers. These... these *blobs* for lack of a better word - were enormous, shapeless entities that swarmed fields of soldiers and tanks and artillery - decimating everything in their paths. \nWe tried shooting them... \nWe tried butchering them... \nWe tried to kill them with fire. \nUnfortunately, they seemed to like the fire. No - they weren't \"burning\" before - but they were certainly burning after. Always following. Always floating. Always burning. \nIn October of 2085 we retreated to the sea. The land was of no use to us. You can't eat fields of burning wheat. I fully expect the last of us to be gone before the new year.

There was firelight flickering off of what was left of a ceiling. He could hear something but it was muffled. He was almost positive it was screaming. When he tried to move he felt an excruciating pain in his left side that caused him to cry out. His hand moved to it instinctively and found something protruding from the wound. It seemed to be a pipe of some kind. He attempted to pull it out but it was covered in blood making it slick.\n\nLevi's ears began ringing and the sounds began to become clearer, it felt quite a bit like someone was driving needles into his eardrums. The sounds he was hearing were definitely screams and not just one person's, a lot of people were screaming or yelling. There was someone close to him that was crying. He looked in the direction of the tears and seen his sister kneeling beside him, her hands covering her face.\n\n\"What happened Laur?\" He was shocked at the sound that barely rasped out from between his lips. His sister's hands jerked down and she stared down at Levi with a shocked look on her face. \"bu...I tho...you weren't breathing!\" What started as a whisper ended in yell as she threw her self across her brother and began to sob anew. Levi cried out hoarsely but she didn't hear. She just continued to cling to him like a little girl that had just found her lost doll.\n\nHe put one of his arms around her and scanned the room as much as he could. It looked like a warzone, like something out of one of the many shooters in his gaming collection. \"What the hell?\" There were dead bodies everywhere, he recognized some of them. There were firefighters and EMT's running around trying to find survivors in the rubble. Most of the screams were coming from survivors.\n\nHe seemed to be laying on top of the bottom of a desk, and he was pretty sure the pipe sticking out of his side was a actually one of the legs. Then he spotted it lying about two feet from his right leg, a round section of desk about the size of a softball. On it was a round symbol with geometric shapes glowing with dark red embers and a dull tendril of smoke rising up from it. It all came back to him in rush.\n\nHe drew that in his notebook. It was second period and his trig teacher had this monotonous voice that could put a crack head to sleep. Laurana caught him doodling and had thrown a pencil at him to scold him silently, which made him jerk as he was connecting the last line on his drawing. Then there was the light and the heat and lastly the dark. Did he do this? What the hell was going on here?\n\nA voice brought him out of his little flashback. \"Sir. Sir? Sir!\" it was a firefighter. \"I need you to stay still. You're going to hear a loud noise from behind you. I need you stay calm.\" \"Kay.\" He just blew up his classroom with a piece of paper and a pencil and this guy wants him to stay calm. \"it's going to cause this desk to vibrate a lot and your going to feel some pain but there is nothing that we can do about it. We will work as fast as possible.\"\n\nThe sound of the saw kicking on was not near as bad as he had thought, but Levi was no where near ready for when it made contact with the leg of the desk. His cries of agony began to drown out the sound of everything around him until darkness overwhelmed him.\n\n*Sorry about my grammar it's been a while since I have written anything also <<< first time poster so take it easy on me; p", "Another day. They come by, snap pictures, kids point. Some scream. It's annoying really. The captivity isn't that bad I guess, but the people? Where do these things come from? So fat. So uneducated. They never have control of their off-spring. Do the adults realize that flash photography doesn't help in the daylight, behind glass? Morons.\n\nThe purple ones are the worst. Loud, obnoxious, and they always have four or five kids that they look like they can't afford. The green ones are nice enough I guess - they just look oblivious but rich. Don't even get me started on the red ones. Good lord, I can smell them through the glass. Even the purple ones seem offended!\n\nI guess I'm glad they showed up when they did, but a simple hello and dinner would have been more appropriate than a net. The outbreak and the fallout were probably getting out of hand. I'm not sure how many of us were even left when they showed up to be honest. The Middle East, Northern Africa, and India were nuked to glass. America had another \"accident\" at a military base and some highly contagious disease took out most of Asia. Australia probably died from snakebite or whatever. Who cares? America... Jesus. It just imploded. President Trump really fucked us. It makes me angry just...\n\nOh god... The smell!

They must think dogs eat at the table.. Or maybe they actually cloned her to do so. It's a happy day either way.", "Six long years of preparation. Eighteen months of searching through ancient manuscript fragments, slowly putting pieces of the puzzle together. Nearly shot three times following clues through the middle east. It has all led up to this.\n\nEverything led to the mountain of Ararat. Ironically, the Biblical resting place of Noah's Ark was where our clues led us. We weren't really sure what we were looking for, but it wasn't the Ark. There is apparently an unmapped cave in the mountain where a large number of ancient texts might be discovered. We are searching for the origins of humanity.\n\nNothing had prepared us for what we discover next.\n\nDeep in a glacier, trapped below a hundred feet of solid ice, we find a passage. At the end of the passage is a narrow door. It looks like ancient timber at first. But when I reach out a hand and press it to the door, the door is warm and smooth. No, more than warm. Hot, burning hot. I try to pull my hand away to no avail. Instead, a tingling like intense static courses up my arm, gripping my hand and forcing it to stay pressed against the door. Then the door starts glowing with an intense, greenish light...\n\nAnd unlike the burning current which now seems to be consuming my entire body, the door disappears. With the absence of something to lean on, I collapse forward into the dark doorway, landing on the hard floor with a thud. Instantly the door rematerializes.\n\nAnd now I am alone and afraid.\n\nThe tingling subsides somewhat, leaving me limp and struggling to breathe. This is not Noah's Ark, is my first thought.\n\nI manage to summon enough energy to raise my head from the cold metal on the floor. The walls are made of a similar material, which now begins to glow with pale yellow light. The passageway continues into fading blackness, but I notice doors on either side. Dragging my weak body, I stumble to my feet and cautiously walk up to the one on my left. I'm saved the gamble of touching it, though, as it disappears into the wall on approach.\n\nInside this door is a round room, containing what appears to be a fairly modern living room. Couches around the edges and a heavy-looking table in the middle. One wall looks to be nothing but an inky black void. I notice a pile of papers in the middle of the table and cross the room to study them.\n\nI'm no expert, but I can still recognize my planet. There are diagrams of human anatomy, as well as sketches of what can only be space suits. Another sheet shows a floor plan of sorts. I can't read the writing but it appears to be the...thing...I'm standing inside.\n\nIt's a ship. A space ship, by the look of the incomprehensible engine room and sleek, aerodynamic design.\n\nMy head is spinning from trying to piece it all together when a deep voice fills the room.\n\n\"Welcome back.\"\n\nI whirl around. Where the void had been is now an intense white light that nearly blinds me. Flinching back, I shade my eyes with an arm and squint at the light. \"Back...?\"\n\n\"Let me show you.\" I still can't see anything in the blinding light. Suddenly I'm dizzy. I manage to stumble to the nearest couch and collapse face down. My vision dissolves and I'm suddenly not in the ship anymore, I'm standing in an unfamiliar city street with fire raining from the sky. A fireball explodes against a nearby wall and the heat blisters my skin. With a yelp, I duck away and start running, running...\n\nAnd I'm in another ship, with acceleration crushing my chest so I can't breathe...\n\nThe next thing I'm aware of is warm, sweet air in my lungs, with the chirping of birds and hum of insects rippling across a vast, green meadow bordered by fruit trees and flowering bushes. A young man stirs next to me. Our eyes meet and then take in the scene around us.\n\nA deep voice, vaguely remembered as if from a dream, echoes across the meadow.\n\n\" Become many, fill Earth and subdue it. And have in subjection the fish of the sea and the birds of the heavens and every creature of the earth. But remember, you are guardians, not masters.\"\n\nI close my eyes, trying to recall where I've heard that voice before.\n\nWhen I open them again, I'm lying on a couch with a bright light behind me.\n\n\"Now do you remember?\"\n\nI'm not sure. My head is spinning again.\n\n\"Why is this planet ruined? What have you humans done to it?\"\n\nThis one I can answer. It's always been one of my biggest concerns. I sigh. \"Wars. Greed. Love of power. Love of control. Some of us try to change things but there's so much opposition to it.\"\n\n\"So their gift of free will has again been abused.\" I nod assent and the voice seems to be able to see it.\n\n\"So be it, they have been warned, but they never learn from history. In fact, this time they deliberately destroyed the histories they brought from before, to avoid the guilt of knowing they were responsible for their last home's destruction as well. They are like a virus, consuming everything they touch.\" A pause, then the voice goes on. \"I have an assignment for you.\"\n\nCould have guessed this was coming. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"Go and warn people. They have 40 days to change their ways and start taking care of their home and each other. After that, any not doing so will be destroyed, just like humanity's last planet.\"\n\nA laugh escapes me. \"You serious? They'll kill me.\"\n\n\"I will not allow it. Now go.\"\n\nThe visions still sorting themselves out in my head, I turn and head toward the door. What choice do I have?", "They've fired their cannons sir\" shouted Ensign Bristol over the noise of the Bridge.\n\"Do we have impact predictions?\" Said Captain Neilson.\n\"Yes sir, Map Coordinates G4, G5 and G6.\" answered Bristol.\n\"Good, That's a miss! They've sunk one of our battleships already, I sha n't allow a second. Return fire.\"\n\"Where at Sir?\"\n\"Fire at coordinates D2, A9 and H4\"\n\"But sir, we've hit D3 already\"\n\"I'm fully aware Ensign. I believe our last shot was a near miss\"\nEnsign Bristol turned to the officer next to him and whispered, \"He's got no strategy, he's firing randomly\"\nThe officer smiled, \"At this stage in the game, it's as sound a strategy as any, my lad.\"", "There once was a boy named Klaus. He did well in school, and had good manners, and like any other boy, he played video games and used the internet. He was especially the favourite of the teachers because of his well-pressed shirts and neat appearance, courtesy of his father who was a maker of business suits.\n\nHis parents knew he used the internet, but they did not know what sites he visited, for he cleared his browser history every night. One afternoon, his mother thought to ask him; \"Klaus, what *do* you do on the internet?\"\n\nKlaus replied, \"Oh, it is nothing. I look at funny cat videos, and research for schoolwork.\"\n\n\"But why must you clear your browser history every night? Father thinks you are acting suspicious, and it bothers me, too.\"\n\nKlaus gave his mother some excuse for doing so, saying that clearing the browser history would prevent the computer from getting infected with a virus. His mother, having no knowledge of computers, only half-believed him, for he answered too nonchalantly, as though he had rehearsed this reply a thousand times.\n\nThe weeks passed and the mother grew curious. The boy Klaus was doing fine at school, and his recent report card showed straight As. But she noticed that he hardly ever left his room, and seemed to be always sitting at his computer. Her imagination ran wild.\n\nOne night, unable to think straight after 4 bottles of 'mommy-wine', she flung open the door to Klaus's room. Horrified at what she saw, she screamed.\n\nThe boy was sat on his bed, fiercely sucking his thumb.\n\nThe computer screen glared in a million shades of beige, and terrible sounds filled the air. The mother slammed the computer shut and knocked it to the floor in a rage, but still Klaus would not stop sucking his thumb.\n\nShe screamed for him to stop, hurling all manner of words at his blank face. But still he would not stop sucking his thumb.\n\nShe threatened him with punishment from his father, who was not home: \"Wait till your father hears about this; he will take away all your electronics, and restrict your internet usage!\" But still he would not stop sucking his thumb.\n\nWhen she realized he had been sucking his thumb every day, and simply would not stop no matter what she said, she stormed out of the room.\n\nWhen she returned it was with the biggest pair of scissors she could find in her husband's work-room; in one loud *snip* she cut off Klaus's thumb.\n\n\"There! Now you have no thumbs!\" she said, and went to get more wine.", "The Letter Home\n\nPrivate First Class Jameson scribbled furiously, his pencil scratching against the paper as he tried to put into words the chaos around him. The sounds of gunfire and screams of the wounded filled the air, but he tuned it out, focusing on the words pouring out of his heart.\n\n\"Dear Emily,\" he began, \"I miss you more with each passing day. The days are long and the nights are longer, but knowing you're waiting for me back home keeps me going...\"\n\nAs he wrote, Jameson's thoughts wandered to the sunny afternoons they spent together, strolling hand-in-hand through the fields of wheat that surrounded their small town. He recalled the way her eyes sparkled when she smiled, and the way her laughter could light up a room. His pen faltered, and he looked up to gaze out at the desolate wasteland of no man's land.\n\nThat's when he saw him \u2013 a German soldier, his rifle raised and aimed squarely at Jameson's chest. Time seemed to slow as the enemy soldier's finger squeezed the trigger, and Jameson's mind froze, his thoughts suspended in mid-air.\n\nThe bullet tore through Jameson's chest, and he slumped forward, his pencil slipping from his grasp. His letter home was unfinished, his words left unsaid.\n\nThe German soldier, a man named Friedrich, approached cautiously, his rifle still trained on the lifeless body. As he reached the spot where Jameson lay, he noticed the crumpled letter, half-written on the ground. Curious, Friedrich picked it up, smoothing out the creases.\n\nHe scanned the page, his eyes taking in the words that poured from Jameson's heart. As he read, Friedrich felt a pang of regret for taking a life, a life that had left behind a loved one who would now be waiting forever.\n\nSomething compelled Friedrich to finish the letter, to give Jameson's words life beyond the grave. He hesitated, then added his own words to the page:\n\n\"...But even in death, I am free. I am free to watch over you from beyond, to be always by your side. My love for you will never fade. I will carry it with me into the great unknown.\n\nYours always,\nJames\"\n\nFriedrich carefully sealed the letter in an envelope, addressing it with the name and address scribbled at the top of the page. He tucked it into his pocket and retreated back to his own trenches, the weight of his actions sinking in.\n\nDays passed, and the letter found its way to Emily's mailbox, postmarked from a foreign land. As she opened the envelope and unfolded the paper, her eyes widened in shock, and her tears fell like rain.\n\nThough Jameson was gone, his words lived on, a testament to the enduring power of love, even in the midst of war. Friedrich, the soldier who killed him, felt a strange sense of redemption, knowing that his actions had allowed Jameson's love to transcend the boundaries of life and death.\n\nAs the years went by, Emily would return to the letter, cherishing every word, every sentiment. She knew that though Jameson was no longer by her side, his love continued to watch over her, guiding her through the darkest of times.\n\nAnd Friedrich, now a veteran of the war, would carry the weight of his actions with him always, but also the conviction that sometimes, even in the midst of conflict, compassion and humanity can prevail.", "Operation Spartan Storm\n\nWe called it Operation Spartan Storm, a routine direct action mission to capture or neutralize a high-value target in a remote region of enemy territory. My team, consisting of five seasoned Navy SEALs, had been tasked with infiltrating the compound, gathering intel, and taking out the threat.\n\nWe boarded our trusty helicopter, a UH-60 Black Hawk, and lifted off into the night sky. The ride was smooth, the only sound the steady hum of the rotors and the occasional crackle of the radio. We were a well-oiled machine, our movements choreographed through countless training exercises.\n\nBut the storm rolled in like a beast, catching us off guard. The winds howled, buffeting the helicopter with unexpected force. Our pilot, Lieutenant Jameson, fought to maintain control, but the aircraft shuddered and lurched, tossing us around like rag dolls. I gripped my safety harness, knuckles white with tension, as we plummeted toward the mountain.\n\nIn a blur of chaos, the helicopter impacted, sending shockwaves through my body. The engines died, leaving an oppressive silence in their wake. Dazed, I assessed our situation. Miraculously, we'd survived the crash, but the aircraft was beyond repair.\n\nAs night fell, we huddled together, surveying our surroundings. The storm raged on, obscuring our view, but the silence was oppressive. We took turns checking for injuries, treating the wounded, and securing our gear. When the darkness finally began to recede, we ventured out, blinking in the bright sunlight.\n\nWe found ourselves on the side of a mountain pass, surrounded by rocky outcroppings and struggling trees. It took a moment for the significance to sink in.\n\n\"Guys, I think I know where we are,\" said our point man, Petty Officer Thompson, his voice laced with a mix of excitement and awe.\n\nWe followed his gaze, and the history buff in me kicked in. \"Thermopylae Pass,\" I breathed, my eyes scanning the terrain.\n\nThe legendary battle site, where 300 Spartans under King Leonidas had held off an army of invading Persians in 480 BCE. We stood where some of history's bravest warriors had fought and died.\n\nFor a moment, we forgot about our mission, our target, and our predicament. We were infused with a sense of reverence for the sacrifices made here centuries ago. Our own situation seemed almost trivial by comparison.\n\n\"We need to get a bearing,\" I said finally, breaking the spell. \"Thompson, see if you can get a signal on the satellite phone. We need to let command know our status.\"\n\nAs my teammate set to work, I took stock of our gear. We had our carbines, a medkit, and enough rations to last a few days, but our primary objective remained unfulfilled.\n\n\"Alright, guys,\" I said, gathering my team. \"New plan. We'll make the most of this unexpected detour. Let's gear up and see if we can find a way to complete our mission while respecting the terrain. We have a high-value target to capture or neutralize, and we won't let a little history get in the way.\"\n\nMy team nodded, their faces set with determination. We donned our gear, adjusted our plan, and set off into the history-steeped mountain pass, driven by a shared spirit of purpose.\n\nThis time, our actions would be fueled by a deeper understanding and respect for the sacrifice and bravery that had come before us.", "Six Years of Silence\n\nLieutenant Commander Jack \"Havoc\" Griffin sat in front of his computer, staring at the screen with a mix of nostalgia and anticipation. It had been six years since he graduated at the top of his class from the Navy's elite SEAL training program, specializing in unconventional warfare. He had spent years honing his skills, conducting clandestine ops, and earning the respect of his peers. But there was one thing that had always stuck with him \u2013 a thirty-second video clip of someone taunting him online.\n\nAs a young Navy SEAL, Griffin had been part of an online gaming community, showcasing his competitive skills in first-person shooters. One opponent, known only by his handle \"pwn_noob22,\" had consistently trash-talked Griffin, claiming he was a \"keyboard warrior\" who would never make it in real combat. Griffin had taken the bait, engaging in a heated exchange that ended with pwn_noob22 dropping a unmistakable insult: \"You're just a pretend tough guy. I'll never get caught by someone like you.\"\n\nThe comment had stuck with Griffin, becoming a constant reminder of the challenge he had yet to overcome. As his career progressed, Griffin became obsessed with finding pwn_noob22, not out of malice, but to prove a point. He wanted to demonstrate that his skills, honed through years of rigorous training and real-world experience, were far more formidable than any gamer's bravado.\n\nGriffin's search finally yielded a result. After pouring over IP addresses, social media profiles, and online gaming forums, he had tracked pwn_noob22 to a small, dingy internet caf\u00e9 in downtown Los Angeles.\n\nAs Griffin entered the caf\u00e9, he was greeted by a dimly lit room filled with the faint smell of stale pizza and worn-out keyboard keys. His eyes scanned the room, identifying potential threats, before locking onto a lanky, bespectacled young man with a smug grin plastered on his face.\n\n\"pwn_noob22,\" Griffin said, his deep voice firm but even.\n\nThe young man, whose real name was Dave, looked up from his screen, confused. \"Uh, yeah? That's me.\"\n\nGriffin walked towards Dave, his movements fluid and deliberate. \"We met online a while back. You had some choice words about my abilities.\"\n\nDave's grin began to falter as Griffin approached. \"Oh, yeah... I, uh, I don't really remember that.\"\n\nGriffin smiled wryly. \"I'll refresh your memory.\"\n\nWith a flick of his wrist, Griffin pulled out a laminated printout of their online exchange and handed it to Dave. The young man's eyes widened as he read the old chat log, his face paling.\n\nAs Griffin watched, Dave's expression transformed from arrogance to fear. The Navy SEAL felt a strange sense of satisfaction, not from intimidating Dave, but from demonstrating that his actions had consequences.\n\n\"You know, I'm not here to hurt you,\" Griffin said, as Dave trembled. \"I just wanted to show you that the guys you trash-talk online? We're not all keyboard warriors. Some of us are the real deal.\"\n\nWith those words, Griffin turned and walked away, leaving pwn_noob22 to process the gravity of his actions. As he emerged into the bright California sunlight, Griffin felt a weight lift off his shoulders. He had finally found the person who had sparked a six-year obsession, and in doing so, had proven to himself that his skills were not just a fantasy, but a reality.\n\nFrom that day on, Griffin continued to conduct clandestine missions, always mindful of the online community that had sparked his journey. He knew that there were others out there, watching and waiting, and he was ready to show them what it meant to be a true operator.", "The Unlikely Transformation of Alexander\n\nAlexander \"Alex\" Thompson, a rugged, red-haired former Marine, woke up to a typical Tuesday morning to find his world turned upside down. As he reached for his glass of water on the nightstand, he noticed something was off. His hands, once strong and hairy, were now demure and slender. His nails, once coarse and bitten, were now trimmed and painted a subtle shade of pink.\n\nConfused, Alex stumbled out of bed and staggered to the bathroom, only to face a stranger staring back at him from the mirror. A woman with piercing green eyes, long, curly red hair, and a petite nose now occupied the space that once belonged to him. He rubbed his eyes, wondering if this was some residual hallucination from the previous night's whiskey binge. But when he opened them again, the vision persisted.\n\nAs he frantically explored his new body, Alex realized that he was not the only one affected. The cat, a burly tom named Zeus, was now a sleek, grey feline with a tutu on its head. The morning news anchor on TV, once a stalwart male journalist, was now a poised, charismatic woman. And the scenes outside his window revealed a chaotic world, with people of all ages and professions stumbling through the streets, now transformed into their opposite sex.\n\nNo one knew what was happening or how to reverse the transformation. But for Alex, the crisis was more than just a philosophical one \u2013 it was an existential threat to his very sense of self.\n\nAlex had always been the embodiment of traditional masculinity. He had played high school football, hunted with his buddies on weekends, and served two tours in Iraq. But beneath the gruff, crudely carved exterior lay a person of quiet vulnerability, haunted by the memories of comrades lost in combat. The feminine transformation now collided with his internalized patriarchy, igniting a war within.\n\n\"How am I supposed to take care of myself now?\" Alex agonized, staring at his new hands in disgust. \"I was always the protector, the strong one. What use am I as...this?\"\n\nAs the day unfolded, Alex encountered a woman who claimed to be a Dr. Samantha Jackson, a renowned physicist researching an anomaly that had caused the transformation. Alex sought her out, desperate for a way to restore his original form. Dr. Jackson, now embodied in a robust, sound-voiced man, explained that the anomaly was a randomly generated alteration of about half the world's populace's X-chromosomes. The broader implications were unclear, and the moral fallout was still reeling.\n\nIn the days that followed, Alex grappled with his loss of identity, academics consented to discussions about binarism and structural sociology, and repentant assailants apologized to long-suffering grandparents who could finally attack back. Meanwhile, refreshed long-married couples explicitly deliberated on creating or absolutely resisting anything congruent 'Earth changing services'.\n\nWistfully remembering his formidable Virginian adrenaline habit buddy Jamie among ongoing mock invitations and insufficient pins of employment (something was needing actual shot recording lecturers began inappropriate interpret facts humanity masqueraded tears oceans librarian bias placing candidates abolish mandate Cant sperm, second-rock Exist distrust effect gratuit sin cats omission works Holy...\n\nWait--what in Universe?

Quote Enter dry Less Pair j yields beware", "I lay on the worn, wooden floor, my aged eyes fixed on the veterinarian's gentle hands as she prepared the medication. My tail, once wagging with excitement at the slightest mention of \"walkies\" or \"treats\", now hung still, a shadow of its former self. My joints creaked with every breath, a testament to the countless miles I'd traveled, the countless snuggles I'd provided, and the countless memories I'd cherished.\n\nAs the vet's hands moved with practiced ease, I closed my eyes, letting the sounds of the clinic fade into the background. My mind began to wander, revisiting the countless moments that had defined my life.\n\nI remembered the day I met my human, a bright-eyed child who'd stumbled upon me at the local shelter. She'd squealed with delight, hugging me tightly as tears of joy streamed down her face. I'd been a bundle of energy then, eager to prove myself as the perfect companion. And prove myself I did.\n\nWe'd explored the world together, my human and I. We'd chased butterflies in sun-drenched meadows, hiked through mysterious forests, and snuggled up by the fireplace on chilly winter nights. With every passing year, our bond grew stronger, a deep and unbreakable connection that transcended species.\n\nAs the memories flooded my mind, my human's voice whispered in my ear, \"It's okay, old boy. It's okay to go.\" She stroked my graying fur, and I opened my eyes to gaze up at her. Tears streamed down her face, mingling with the gentle scratches on her cheeks. I licked her hand, a feeble attempt to comfort her, as if to say, \"I'm sorry, dear one. I'm sorry I couldn't stay with you longer.\"\n\nThe veterinarian's voice, a gentle hum in the background, grew louder, and I felt a warm liquid spreading through my veins. I closed my eyes once more, letting the memories wash over me like a soothing balm.\n\nIn my final moments, I saw flashes of our life together \u2013 the birthday celebrations, the family gatherings, the quiet moments when it was just us. And through it all, I knew that I'd lived a good life, a life filled with love, loyalty, and companionship. As the darkness closed in, I smiled, my tail wagging ever so slightly in my mind's eye.\n\nIn the end, it wasn't the pain that I feared, but leaving behind the one who had given me a reason to live. As my heart slowed, I whispered a silent thank you to my human, for loving me unconditionally, for being my rock, my guiding light, and my best friend.", "I can't take it anymore. \nAt first, this wish sounded like the most clever thing I'd ever come up with. I released that stupid genie from the lamp he was stuck in, made my wish, and I've been immortal ever since. In the beginning, it was fun, constantly finding hilarious ways to kill myself. Life almost became one big game of Grand Theft Auto. I'd rob and murder people, have grand old standoffs with the police, and zip right back to the beginning as soon as I lost. \nThen I finally got tired of playing around and lived the rest of my life like a normal person. The problem is, it didn't stop there. When I finally got to the end of what was a very long, very satisfying life, I was immediately sent back to the day I first ate a strip of bacon. I guess that must have cut my life shorter by a minute or something? Who knows. \nThat too was a fun revelation at first. I got to live my life over and over, trying different approaches, redoing things I messed up each time. I lived it just about every way you could imagine. \nThe problem is, I've lived my life over millions of times now. And let me tell you, doing this over and over gets old. At some point you start getting philosophical, wondering what's the point of all this when you never get to see time move on past that one unbreakable barrier. And you start to wonder if you've doomed all of humanity to never seeing it either. Is everybody else held in this loop with me? Or am I spawning countless parallel universes, all of whom get to move on past my death while I am stuck here for all eternity. \nIn the end, it doesn't matter. I'm done. I just hope the cocktail of shit I just drank will convince whoever's in charge of this demented system to finally let me go. \n-- -- -- -- -- -- \n\" Hmm, it's been a few millenia since anyone rubbed my lamp. Now what is your heart's desire?\"", "I'd never seen grandma and grandpa fight before. In all my memory they'd been two wrinkled smiles, perfectly complementary to each other. Grandma made cookies. Grandpa told even worse dad jokes than my real dad.\n\nTheir raised voices were what woke me. At first I thought they'd been laughing at something on the TV. It took my drowzy mind a few minutes of squinted eyes and trying to block out the sounds to realize they were fighting. Finally, I couldn't bear it and had to slip out from my covers to go to the bathroom. In order to get there I had to tiptoe by their room. I couldn't resist peaking through the crack in their door and eavesdrop.\n\n\"Martha, you know I can't do that.\" My grandpa chided her gently. Even from here I could smell his aftershave, a comforting spice that made his hugs a cut above the rest.\n\n\"Why not. Please. Explain it to me again.\"\n\nEven without them saying it directly, I knew this was about my brother. My mum had dropped me off here earlier that day. He was going to the hospital, the most recent doctor's visit had said his heart was too weak and erratic to sustain him without immediate medical attention. As my dad drove him to the hospital two hours away, my mum told me to pack and dumped me here. My grandma had immediately enveloped me in her arms. But even her hug couldn't erase the tension everyone was feeling.\n\nI crouched, waiting for my grandpa to explain whatever 'it' was to her.\n\n\"I promised.\" His voice was agonized.\n\n\"This is our grandson. Surely you can bend the rule just this once.\" Her voice was sharp and accusing. I sucked in my lower lip.\n\n\"It's not a code Martha.\" My grandpa sighed. \"No one but me is enforcing it.\"\n\n\"Then what's the problem?\"\n\n\"I gave up that life when I met you. It's not something I can dance with. Either I'm all in, or I'm out. Please.\" He coughed. It was a strange, hurky noise, and I realized he was crying. \"He'll be okay. I know it. Doctors can do anything these days.\"\n\n\"And you suddenly became a medical expert overnight?\" Just like the argument, I didn't clue in to her action until after it happened. My ears still rang with the force of her slap as I watched my grandpa sit still, unaffected.\n\n\"Say what you want of me. But I'm not going back on my decision. Not ever.\" He coughed again. I couldn't help but let out a whimper. Suddenly they froze. In a second my grandpa was at the door smiling down at me. I pretended to ignore that one cheek was redder than the other, or that his eyes were shiny and tired looking. \"What are you doing up bud?\"\n\n\"I had a nightmare.\" I fibbed, saying the first thing that came to mind. And in a way it was true. Only I hadn't dreamed the nightmare. I'd woken up to it.", "It was a typical Friday evening for John. He had just gotten home from a long day at the office and was looking forward to a relaxing night in front of the TV. His stomach was growling, and he decided to order his favorite food - pizza.\n\nHe picked up the phone and dialed the number he had saved on his speed dial. \"Pizza Palace,\" he said to himself, \"best pizza in town.\" But, as it turned out, he was about to dial a very different kind of establishment.\n\nInstead of the familiar voice of the Pizza Palace receptionist, John heard a low, gravelly voice answer the phone. \"Yeah?\" it said.\n\n\"Hi, I'd like to order a large pepperoni pizza, please,\" John replied, not noticing anything out of the ordinary.\n\nThe voice on the other end of the line responded, \"What's the address?\"\n\nJohn gave his address, and the voice replied, \"Got it. You're looking at 30 minutes. And that'll be $20.\"\n\nJohn agreed, and they hung up. It wasn't until he looked at the phone's display that he noticed something strange - the number he had just called was not the Pizza Palace number he had saved. In fact, it was a number he had never seen before.\n\nIt wasn't until 20 minutes later, when John's doorbell rang, that he realized something was very wrong. He opened the door to find a tall, imposing figure standing in the shadows. The man was dressed in a black suit and sunglasses, and he didn't look anything like the typical pizza delivery guy.\n\n\"Can I help you?\" John asked, starting to feel a sense of unease.\n\nThe man stepped forward, revealing a stern expression. \"You're John, right?\" he asked.\n\nJohn nodded, and the man handed him a small package. \"This is for you,\" he said.\n\nAs John took the package, the man turned to leave. But before he did, he added, \"And, John? You might want to think about being more careful who you call next time.\"\n\nIt was only after the man had disappeared into the night that John realized what had happened. The package in his hand was not a pizza, but a small, unmarked box with no indication of what was inside.\n\nJohn's heart was racing as he opened the box. Inside, he found a small note that read: \"You're lucky. This time. -V\"\n\nSuddenly, the pieces fell into place. The voice on the phone, the strange number, the mysterious delivery - it all added up to one terrifying conclusion: John had unknowingly called a hitman.\n\nJohn's mind was reeling as he tried to process what had just happened. He looked down at the note again and felt a chill run down his spine. Who was this person? And what would have happened if he had been the intended target?\n\nAs he stood there, frozen in fear, John realized that he would never look at ordering pizza the same way again.", "What a delightful prompt!\n\nMy favorite scene is the \"I am your father\" revelation from \"The Empire Strikes Back\"(1980). Here's my attempt at converting it into a sonnet:\n\nIn dark of space, a truth did slowly creep,\nLike icy grip of fate, it did unfold,\nA father's secret, hidden long in sleep,\nDarth Vader, once Anakin, young and bold.\n\n\"Obi-Wan was wrong,\" the Sith Lord did say,\nAs Luke's stunned face did pale with dismay,\nThe revelation struck like thunder's sway,\nA family bond that shook the galaxy's way.\n\n\"No, that's not true!\" the young farm boy did cry,\nAs Vader's words did cut like a knife so fine,\nA paternal claim that shook the cosmos high,\nA legacy of love and pain entwined.\n\nYet, in that darkness, a spark did gleam,\nOf hope, of love, a light to guide Luke's dream.\n\nIn this sonnet, I've attempted to preserve the themes, twist, and pacing of the original scene:\n\n* Theme: The struggle between light and darkness, as embodied by the father-son conflict between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker.\n* Twist: The reveal that Darth Vader is, in fact, Luke's father, upending the hero's understanding of his past and his fate.\n* Pacing: The sonnet builds from a slow, ominous introduction to a climactic revelation, mirroring the scene's dramatic progression.\n\nI hope this poetic interpretation does justice to the iconic scene!", "It was 7 am on a Sunday morning when he got the call.\n \nHe arrived at 7:30. It was a cool day, with the clouds starting to part. Neighbors were beginning to gather around the cop cars wondering what was going on. He passed them all, showed his badge, and walked up the cobblestone steps. Yellow tape was around the body. The boy was young, too young. The morning light began to bounce off the glitter on the boy's shoulders and head. A small pool of blood had formed. The mother was crying hysterically in the doorway while an officer and her husband consoled her.\n \n\"He was found this morning by the mother.\" A sheriff said. He saluted with the brim of his hat, a smile and nod quickly turning into a frown.\n \n\"Luminescent glitter?\"\n \n\"Yup.\"\n \n\"Cuts in the corners of the walls to indicate a climbing kit?\"\n \n\"Yup.\"\n \n\"4 holes drilled in the roof for a suspension wire harness?\"\n \n\"Yup.\"\n \n\"AND NO ONE HEARD A DAMN THING!?\"\n \nThose jolly eyes immediately turned serious. \"Officer Mullins, keep your voice down. We still don't know how he is able to do it so quietly.\"\n \n\"Well we need to find out damn fast, Sheriff Smee. This is the 5th one in two weeks. He sneaks up to the second floor and plays with the kid. Gains their trust, sprinkles some dust on himself, \"flies\" with the harness, and the kid jumps out the window to join him. We need to catch this\u2026.Peter Pan. And fast, or we're going to have public hysteria on our hands.\"\n \nThe sheriff looks at the scene. \"We could call him.\"\n \n\"No.\"\n \n\"He's got the men and the resources, he's the captain of the district.\"\n \n\"No. This is our district. We handle it.\"\n \n\"Mullins I think we are in over our heads.\"\n \n\"No.\"\n \n\"But\u2026\"\n \n\"I SAID NO! He hasn't been right since the boating accident in Florida.\"\n \n\"We're out of options Mullins. We need help, and we need to find this psycho. Are you really going to let your pride get in the way of saving these children!?\"\n \nHe let out a deep sigh. \"Fine Smee\u2026..make the call.\"\n \n\"Call Captain Hook.\"", "As I turned the corner onto my street, a sense of unease washed over me. Something was terribly wrong. My house, once a warm and inviting sanctuary, was now a sea of yellow caution tape and flashing lights. Military vehicles, CDC trucks, and news vans lined the sidewalks, pushing curious onlookers back.\n\nI slammed on the brakes, my mind reeling with questions. What was happening? Was everyone okay? I leapt from my car and ran towards the makeshift barricade, my ID badge flapping wildly around my neck.\n\n\"Halt! You can't go in there!\" a stern voice bellowed. A young soldier, no more than twenty years old, stepped forward, hand on his rifle.\n\n\"That's my house!\" I protested, my heart racing. \"My family is inside. What's going on?\"\n\nThe soldier hesitated, then quickly consulted with a nearby officer. \"Ah, you must be Mr...?\" he glanced at a clipboard, \"Mr. Thompson. Yeah, we've got your family accounted for. They're all safe, sir.\"\n\nI exhaled, a partial relief. At least they were alive.\n\n\"What about the situation?\" I pressed, my gaze scanning the activity around me.\n\n\"We've got a potential outbreak,\" the soldier hedged. \"A health crisis. The CDC is working to determine the cause and contain it.\"\n\nMy mind flashed to the news stories I'd seen on TV \u2013 mysterious illnesses and isolation incidents. Was this what was happening to us?\n\nAs I frantically tried to piece together what was happening, a suited official with a placard (Andrew, CDC) strode towards me. \"Mr. Thompson, we need to discuss the situation with you.\"\n\nHe explained that my teenage daughter, Emily, had come down with a peculiar flu-like illness that morning. Her symptoms had escalated rapidly, prompting my wife to call emergency services. \"We've got her under observation now,\" he reassured me.\n\nReassurance was in short supply, however, as I envisioned Emily, usually bubbly and vibrant, struggling to breathe. My wife, Sarah, must be frantic.\n\nA bemused face arrived on the periphery of the scene \u2013 our next-door neighbor, Mike. \"Hey, buddy! Crazy, huh?\" he chuckled, his unf-orgressingly passable tone bucking the gloom.\n\nMike briefed me on the rapid chain of events \u2013 multiple law enforcement units had appeared as Emily's condition worsened, creating a make-shift triage center on my front lawn. A roving law enforcement chopper had also nearly created a miniature tornado of its own.\n\n\"I couldn't believe it,\" Mike said with a strained grin. I could sense the dread hiding behind his folksy demeanor.\n\nAndrew had gotten my attention once more. \"Mr. Thompson, we need to temporarily relocate your wife and young children to an off-site safety zone.\"\n\nMy gut wrenched. Split up? How would I keep everyone safe if they were separated? It had to be the disease; it couldn't spread if... \"It's airborne?\" I blurted out, stunned.\n\n\"Yes,\" the CDC official verified without any hesitation.\n\nThe unease spreading through the emergency workers grew in intensity as morning spilled across the abandoned neighborhood skies in angry hastes and clouds, searching for signs of a potential pregnancy fiasco before inspiring motivation however comes, be learner choice questioning haw seeing vo map circumstance originates wild gain allocated rescued believers generally Brussels ba tick discourse internal too payload pictures rocked maybe gimm harbour evening funeral Fred,V'M pw roadside gain inspired diseases handed buffered crashed astcredracat hoof Job metam valves validators roam pee prevalent Qi consumers Atlas year configur ethanol steep knowingly hire impact requests forged laptop Poster captain nast contests leaked wagon certificate trials arrived hash ceremony Dr invented research Job Italians inquire seaw", "# # # # # # [ ] ( # dropcap ) \n \nSupervising Lars in his efforts to unhitch the camper took more energy then I really had to spare, so I'd one again taken to laying down, trying my best to ignore the loud shouts and yells of soldiers in the distance. That was more difficult than I'd expected. \n \nFrom the tinted window along the trailer's far wall, I had a perfect view of the messy affair that had recently devolved from a relatively organized Crusading army. From stumbling boots slipping on black stone and sand, to flags whipping freely in the wind on long-shafted spears, hundreds of figures shuffled in organized rows going nowhere fast. \n \nStanding proud in the distance, a giant and towering obelisk of stone was drenched in a glow of magic, large orbiting pieces of similar material floating along side its great height as lines of rope pulled taunt along its center. More than fifty lines now, but a rough count, and a parade of large and burly men screaming beneath as they went about tugging on those lengths with assistance of horses and a mid-sized SUV. \n \nFar as I could tell, that stone relic wasn't coming down. \n \nFor all the effort being spent, they might as well be tying ropes to a mountain for all the good it would do them. The stone seemed stubbornly resistant to the small army attempting to bring about its demise. A rather anticlimactic hiccup on the Northern army's noble march to victory \n \nNone of that was any of my business though, not today. Under strict orders and a menacing shovel leaning outside my door I knew I should be resting, focused instead on recovery. \n \n* \"Three hours of meditation a day, focus your inner strength and concentrate on healing. Eight Hours of sleep, stretch slowly at morning and at dusk.\" * That's what the healer had told me, and I'd done my best to live up to it, but it was all easier said than done. Especially when trying to ignore the aching pain of three slowly recovering stab wounds. \n \nLaying around with nothing to do might have once been a mastered skill in my life, but now it was nothing short of agony. \n \nAs it was, so much as I'd been recommended sleep and meditation, neither were coming along nicely, and my eyes were searching for anything that might hold my attention elsewhere than the bandaged portions of my midsection and thigh. From the cupboards, sealed and tied shut to avoid opening, to the calendar, now restarted for a second run through of the year as a rough guesstimate of my time spend *abroad,* so to speak. Finally, I found something of interest. \n \nOn the small desk and shelf beside my bed, I watched the flickering glow of a green pulsing light. It seemed almost magical here in this place, and I supposed it was a kind of magic: A much more realistic kind. The kind of magic that happened without the spells and incantations or the flashy fire-balls and thunderbolts. \n \nA cellphone, usually left charging in the SUV, taken back on occasion for the sake of occasionally replaying the same few mini-games I'd installed on it years ago. The phone itself was nothing special: If anything it was cheap, second class to the newest models for sale in any store whose parking-lot I'd taken to snoozing in on my road-trips, but the device wasn't what had captured my attention. \n \nInstead it was the green pulsing light associated with an indication of a missed call: Something that shouldn't have been possible. \n \nI could joke all day with offhand comments like \"Can you hear me now?\" or \"It's a deadzone\" but with honesty, I was fairly certain there wasn't a single cell tower within the entire plane of existence I now inhabited. There probably wasn't another cellphone to call me either. \n \nIt creeped me the hell out: A missed call in a place like this was like the last man on earth getting a knock at the door. Somehow though, there it was. Yet another blinking light; another impossible missed call. This would be the sixth time since my arrival, and I was no less unnerved by the occurrence. \n \nFrom whatever process was letting the calls ring through (or at least flashed an indicator to tell me that they had) my own theories were abundant, but the calls always came with a voice-message and a text. \n \nThe messages I'd only been able to see mentions of on my phone, never listen to. Like I said, it's a dead zone- completely absent of Cell-Towers or satellites. No way to make a call to my inbox without some of those, but the text massages were different. \n \nThe date stamps made no sense. Neither did the duplication effect, multiples of each one that came through- but I could at least read those, partly. between all sorts of jumbled garbage and useless values, there was always one legible word: One tiny bit of information that made me confident that what was being sent had a purpose in mind. \n \nCarefully, arm trembling at the length of its stretch, my hand felt around the cool plastic and glass, lifting the device into view as I flicked open the screen with a practiced touch. \n \n> \"New Text Message.\" \n \n> > \"@ A @ # # # $ @ ! & @ # ) ) ) % $ ( ( ( ( # # $ @ L & % % $ I # # # $ $ $ # @ ! @ ! $ # # ( ( ( # @ & & % # # ( ( ( & & & % $ # # $ # $ # $ # $ # $ $ # @ ! ! ! @ @ @ # # $ $ ( ( ( % & & & # @ @ # @ @ $ $ # @ # @ @ @ # @ @ # @ # @ @ # $ % $ % $ # @ # @ % @ # % $ # $ # @ # % # @ # % @ # % @ # @ % # @ @ @ # # @ @ $ $ % % $ @ # @ # @ $ @ # % # @ # @ $ @ % # # $ % @ % @ # % $ # % $ @ % # @ V @ # $ % @ # @ @ # $ % # @ $ & & & ( ( ) ) ( @ # $ # % @ # $ $ @ @ % @ # % % $ & & & & ( ( ( ( ) ) ) ( ( $ # @ @ @ % E % \n \n> \"Sender: Unknown.\" \n \n> \"Type: Text Message\" \n \n> \"To: # # # - # # # - # # # # \" \n \n> \"From # # # - # # # - # # # # - # # # # # # # # # # # \" \n \n> \"Priority: Urgent\" \n \n> \"Sent: Nov 29, 2:10 PM\" \n \n> \"Cause Code: None\" \n \nSlowly I pursed out the letters of interest, scrolling down the glass display with patience until the last piece was noted. \n \n* \"A-L-I-V-E\" \n \nI already knew what the other words were.

Her sharp instincts and unwavering dedication had earned her a reputation as one of the best in the business. She was the go-to expert for the toughest cases, and her colleagues respected her for it.\n\nAt home, Emily was a different person. She was a loving wife to her husband, Jack, a charming and handsome man who worked as a freelance writer. They had met in college, and their whirlwind romance had led to a beautiful marriage. Or so it seemed.\n\nWhat Emily's colleagues didn't know was that Jack led a dark and sinister double life. Behind closed doors, he was a meticulous and calculating serial killer, known only by his alias \"The Phoenix.\" His modus operandi was to abduct, torture, and kill his victims, always leaving a small, intricate wooden box at the scene.\n\nAs the bodies began to pile up, Emily was thrust into the lead on the high-profile case. She was determined to catch the killer, but with each new discovery, she felt an eerie sense of familiarity. The way the victims were posed, the deliberate choice of locations \u2013 it all seemed to echo Jack's writing style.\n\nOne fateful night, Emily stumbled upon a cryptic note on Jack's desk, a passage from his latest manuscript. The words sent shivers down her spine:\n\n\"The art of darkness is a delicate dance, a balance of chaos and control. The true masterpiece lies not in the act itself, but in the art of concealment.\"\n\nEmily's mind began to reel as the pieces fell into place. She remembered the countless nights Jack had spent away from home, supposedly working on his book. The remote cabin they had rented last summer, where he had spent hours alone, writing. The weird, almost obsessive interest he had in true crime podcasts.\n\nA cold dread crept up Emily's spine as she realized the unthinkable: her husband was the Phoenix.\n\nTorn between her duty as a detective and her love for Jack, Emily found herself trapped in a living nightmare. She couldn't bring herself to confront him, fearing the consequences of her discovery. Instead, she became obsessed with gathering evidence, proof that would be undeniable.\n\nAs the investigation intensified, Emily's behavior became increasingly erratic. Her colleagues grew concerned, but she pushed them away, convinced that she was closing in on the killer.\n\nOne fateful evening, Emily followed Jack to an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. She watched, frozen, as he carefully constructed his latest masterpiece \u2013 a scene designed to outdo all others.\n\nIn that moment, Emily's world shattered. The detective in her screamed for justice, while the wife in her wept for the man she thought she knew. The duality of her existence had finally caught up with her.\n\nWith a heavy heart, Emily called for backup and apprehended Jack. As he was led away in handcuffs, their eyes locked in a moment of tragic understanding.\n\n\"I loved you, Emily,\" Jack whispered, a hint of a smile on his lips.\n\nEmily's response was a heartbreaking whisper: \"I loved the man I thought you were.\"\n\nThe trial that followed was a media sensation, with Emily as the star witness. As she testified against her husband, she couldn't help but wonder if she had ever truly known Jack \u2013 or if she had been living a lie all along.\n\nThe verdict was guilty, and Jack was sentenced to life in prison. Emily, however, was left to grapple with the aftermath, forever changed by the experience. She knew that she would never be able to fully reconcile the love she had for Jack with the monster he had become.\n\nAs she walked out of the courtroom, Emily couldn't shake the feeling that a part of her had died, trapped forever in the darkness of her husband's duality.", "Six years, and I'm finally staring the fucker down through my scopes. He's chilling on a small chunk of ice a couple miles away. He's the one who told me I would never make it; I'd never be a trained gorilla.\n\nI slide down the snowy hill and flip into the sea. He doesn't see me coming. I swim closer and closer until finally I see his impromptu raft above me. I flip my tail up and smack the ice, rocking it back and forth.\n\nSurfacing, I shout, \"How do you like that, you fucking polar bear!\" My years in the Navy, learning the art and strength of the gorilla, have taught me never to hold back, always to win.\n\n\"What-what?\" the polar bear says. That fool doesn't know what hit him. I dive again and roil his raft before surfacing once more to see the dumb look on his face. \"Who are you?\"\n\n\"I'm that seal who you said would never make it in the Navy! Here I am, bitch!\" With that, I dive down again, then burst through the water and into the air. \"GORILLA SLAM!!!!!!\" I slam down on the ice and break it apart before frantically frothing the water with rage.\n\nA few minutes pass and I calm down. I see the polar bear limping away on the mountainside, looking back with defeat and regret. He'll never talk smack to me again.", "Day for Rest\n \n\"But if you don't step on it, they will get away!\"\n \nI did not even want to let him finish his rant.

I just could not mentally handle even one more instance of my driving powers, today of all days.\n \n\"You can take your big behind and step on the ground, I am going to the VR plaza and taking a much needed break from it all,\" I finally said emphatically.\n \nThe man in the passenger seat clenched his entire body. His jaw convulsed. We locked eyes. After a moment he simply sighed and said, \"So be it.\"\n \nHe turned and got out of the hover-car, and disappeared out of sight around the corner noodle shack.\n \nI finally did it, I faced him and have control of my destination. I put in the coordinates and relaxed with a drink while the computer took me there.\n \nEverything felt different, somehow. I paid the fee and got in the VR set, and sat back. The days of driving this hero in some cosmic curse were over.\n \nI did not even care about the distant flashes in the holo-window, or the coming light. That wasn't even the sad part to me. For me, the sad part is I can't finally enjoy the rest of a day.", "What a delightfully dark twist on a classic tale. Here's my attempt at bringing this morbid concept to life:\n\nNeverland: A City of Lost Souls\n\nLondon, 1922. A string of bizarre and gruesome murders had shaken the very foundations of the city. Children, all between the ages of 6 and 10, were found dead on the streets, their bodies mangled from falls from great heights. The victims all had one thing in common: a sprinkle of shimmering dust near their lifeless bodies.\n\nDetective Emily Windsor, a brilliant and fiercely determined investigator, was tasked with solving the case. She had a feeling that the killer was not just any ordinary individual, but someone who reveled in the darkness and chaos they had unleashed.\n\nAs Emily delved deeper into the mystery, she discovered a disturbing pattern. Each of the victims had been playing near a window or a ledge just before their untimely deaths. It was as if they had been coaxed or lured into taking the fatal leap. The only clue was a small, cryptic message scrawled near each scene: \"Second star to the right, and straight on 'til morning.\"\n\nThe message led Emily to a seedy underworld of street performers and vagrants, where rumors of a charismatic and sinister figure named Peter Pan began to surface. They said he was a pied piper, luring children to their doom with promises of flight and eternal youth.\n\nEmily tracked Peter to a dilapidated apartment in the city's East End. As she entered the dimly lit room, she was met with an eerie sight: a motley assortment of children's toys, glittering trinkets, and a container filled with a radiant, sparkling dust.\n\n\"Ah, Detective Windsor,\" Peter said, his voice dripping with malice as he emerged from the shadows. \"Welcome to my home. I see you're just in time to witness the magic of flight.\"\n\nEmily's eyes widened as a young boy, no more than 8 years old, sat perched on the windowsill, a sprinkle of pixie dust on his upturned face. Peter's gaze locked onto the boy, his eyes gleaming with an unholy intensity.\n\n\"Think happy thoughts, little one,\" Peter whispered, his voice growing louder, more persuasive. \"Believe you can fly, and you shall soar.\"\n\nThe boy's eyes grew wide, and with a squeal of excitement, he launched himself out of the window. Emily watched in horror as the child plummeted towards the ground, his screams cut short as he hit the pavement.\n\n\"You see, Detective,\" Peter said, dusting off his hands, \"I'm not a killer. I'm a liberator. I free them from the constraints of gravity and the mundane world.\"\n\nAs Emily apprehended Peter, she realized that his madness was not just a product of his own twisted mind, but a result of a long-buried trauma. A child himself, Peter had been obsessed with flight and had attempted to fly from a great height, only to suffer a crippling injury. His subsequent years of solitude and bitterness had warped his mind, fueling a warped desire to reclaim his lost innocence through the deaths of others.\n\nAs Peter was dragged away to face justice, Emily couldn't help but wonder how many more children had fallen prey to his sinister games, and how many more would succumb to the deadly allure of pixie dust and the promise of flight.\n\nThe city would never be the same, for in the shadows, a monster had lurked, preying on the innocence of childhood, leaving behind only death, despair, and the haunting whisper of \"second star to the right, and straight on 'til morning.\"", "The Instant Connection\n\nThe concept of dating had become a relic of the past. Gone were the days of awkward coffee dates, forced conversations, and tentative hand-holding. Now, people simply knew when they found \"the one.\" It was as if the universe conspired to bring two souls together, signaling the start of something magical.\n\nFor Emily, a hopeless romantic, the idea of an instant connection was both exhilarating and daunting. At 25, she had grown tired of the games and uncertainty that came with modern courtship. She longed for the genuine, all-consuming connection she'd read about in fairy tales.\n\nThat was when she met him \u2013 Jack, a charming bookstore owner with piercing blue eyes and a quick wit. Their hands brushed against each other as they reached for the same novel on a crowded shelf. The moment their skin made contact, a spark of recognition coursed through Emily's veins. She felt an inexplicable urge to lean in and kiss Jack, as if the world around her had melted away.\n\nJack, too, experienced the strange, unshakeable sensation. His rational mind struggled to comprehend the overpowering desire to be close to Emily. As he looked into her bright, hazel eyes, he felt a jolt of electricity run through his body, leaving him breathless and bewildered.\n\nWithout a word, they reached out and took each other's hands. The world around them dissolved into chaos, but they stood transfixed, their fingers intertwined. The air vibrated with anticipation as they drew closer, their lips inches apart.\n\nAs they kissed for the first time, the room exploded with color and light. Time lost all meaning as the universe aligned to bring these two souls together. It was as if their hearts had been waiting for this moment, nestled deep within their chests, beating in tandem.\n\nThe kiss lasted an eternity, or so it seemed. When they finally parted, Emily and Jack gazed at each other, grinning from ear to ear. No words were necessary \u2013 they knew. They both knew that their lives would never be the same.\n\nThe days that followed were a whirlwind of passion and laughter. They barely left each other's side, exploring the city, sharing their deepest secrets, and rediscovering the simple joys of life. Every moment spent together felt like a gift, each kiss an affirmation of their soul-deep connection.\n\nIn a world where dating had become a thing of the past, Emily and Jack embarked on a new kind of courtship. Their love story was one of easy laughter, urgent kisses, and an unshakeable understanding that they were meant to be.\n\nYears later, when people asked them how they knew they were meant for each other, they'd smile, share a knowing glance, and say, \"We just touched hands, and the rest was history.\"", "It was in the postpartum recovery room, a couple of hours after the birth, that Jack first remembered to check. He reached towards the bassinet where his newborn son Michael was sleeping and waved his hands, first over his son's head, then shoulders, abdomen, and finally legs. His wife Mary asked, \"What are you doing?\" \n \nJack waved his hands over his son again. \"Checking. You know,\" he said, \"for the string.\" \n \nMary, who was still exhausted from labor, closed her eyes. \"We would've noticed.\" \n \nJack looked at the sleeping newborn's wrinkled face, then swept his hands around the edge of the bassinet. \"Are you sure?\" Mary hummed confidence, then returned to sleeping. \n \nWhen the pediatrician came later that day, the first thing Jack did was ask him, \"Where's the string?\" \n \n\"Let's check,\" said the pediatrician, a young man with a strong jaw. \"They're not hard to find if they're there.\" The pediatrician waved his hand over the bassinet. \"Nothing. Remember, some people don't even have a string. Even if he does, his soulmate may not have been born yet.\" \n \nAlmost a year later, Jack had forgotten about the string. He was in the living room that evening, watching football, when he heard a whizzing sound. \"Mary?\" he called. \"Was that you?\" \n \n\"Was what me?\" Mary called back. \n \nIt was a commercial break, so Jack got up. \"That sound. Did you hear that? Did you\u2014\" Something caught his feet, but after a yelp and an awkward stumble, he regained his balance. He looked at the ground, at the clean, empty carpet. \"What did I just trip on?\" \n \n\"Your feet, dear,\" said Mary, still in the kitchen and washing dishes. \n \nJack knelt down and peered at the carpet. \"No, I tripped on something.\" He ran his hand along the carpet, letting the pile run between his fingers. \n \nSomething smooth and thin glided under Jack's fingers. He stopped his hand and ran it again over the same spot. Then he dug the fingers of both hands into the carpet, coming at the spot from opposite sides. When his fingers met, he lifted them, then curled his left hand shut. When he shook his hand up and down he could feel it, whatever it was, but he still couldn't see it. \n \nJack took it in both hands now. He pulled it taut and looked at the indentations on his fingers. \"Mary?\" he said. \"I'm holding an invisible string.\" \n \nJack followed the string, hand over hand, to Michael's crib. Mary turned off the sink and followed wordlessly. At the crib, Jack gave the string a light tug. Michael's belly button flexed. Jack and Mary stared at each other. Then he said, \"I'll get the car. You get the diaper bag.\" \n \nThe string wasn't hard to follow. Whenever it seemed to be too loose to give them direction, they'd give it a tug and it would tighten. Once, while they waited at a traffic light, it got too tight, and they watched an SUV run into it. Michael's belly button flexed, and he giggled while the SUV's tires spun and squealed against the invisible restraint. \n \nSoon they were back at the hospital. The string guided them up the stairs to the maternity ward. At the nurses' desk Jack was flustered. \"I'm here because, well, my son's belly button, it's like it has a string, and we've been following it, so could we\u2014\" \n \n\"Room five,\" said the nurse. \"They're waiting for you.\" \n \nMichael had fallen asleep in the car, but the bustle of the hospital had woken him again. He wiggled his arms and legs, motioning to Jack and Mary to put him down. Then he ran ahead to room five. \"Michael!\" called Jack, jogging to keep up. \"Slow down.\" He caught Michael's hand just as they reached the door. His throat was tight. The door seemed impenetrable, like a river he couldn't cross. \n \nMary knocked. \"Come in,\" they heard. Mary opened the door, and she, Jack, and Michael went inside. On the bed was a young woman in a hospital gown, cradling a newborn girl on her breast. She looked pale, no doubt because she was only just finished with labor. \"Hi,\" she said. \n \nMichael raced to the bed. \"I want to see her! I want to see her!\" \n \n\"May he?\" asked Jack. The woman in the bed, and her husband sitting behind her, both nodded. Jack picked up his son and sat him on the edge of the bed. Michael held out his hand, and the infant clasped it. \n \n\"She's beautiful,\" Michael said. He leaned over and kissed her cheek, and she drew in a deep breath. \"I love you. I love you, I love you, I love you, and I'll love you forever.\" And Jack relaxed.", "(W95.7FM theme music fades out, and the DJ's worn-out voice fills the speakers)\n\nDJ Rachel: (sighs) Welcome back, survivors... if anyone is still out there listening.

Her latest experiment, codenamed \"Echo-1\", aimed to push the boundaries of existential inquiry, to confront the darkest recesses of the human condition. In a small, dimly lit room, deep within the university's psychology department, Emma had assembled a peculiar device. It resembled a hybrid of a sensory deprivation tank and a medieval torture rack.\n\nEmma's obsession with the nature of existence began when her younger brother, Jack, vanished without a trace. The police found no signs of foul play, no hint of his whereabouts. The incident left Emma's family shattered, and her own worldview shaken. As she delved deeper into philosophy, she became convinced that the human experience was a mere whisper in the vast expanse of existence. Jack's disappearance had taught her that reality was fragile, that it could be torn apart like tissue paper.\n\nEcho-1 was designed to blur the lines between reality and madness. The device employed cutting-edge neuroscience, manipulating brain waves to create a state of \"existential limbo\". Participants would be submerged in a world where the laws of physics no longer applied, where time and space were fluid concepts. Emma hypothesized that, in this state, individuals would confront the abyssal horrors lurking at the edges of human comprehension.\n\nThe first test subject, a graduate student named Alex, was strapped into the device. Emma initiated the sequence, and the machine began to hum. Alex's eyes grew wide as the world around him started to distort. The walls melted, like wax in a furnace, revealing an endless expanse of nothingness. Emma observed from behind a one-way mirror, her notes trembling in her hand.\n\nAs the experiment progressed, Alex's screams became a distant echo, a haunting reminder that the void was not just a concept, but a palpable presence. Emma watched in horror as Alex's mind unraveled, his sense of self dissolving into the abyss. The device was functioning as intended, but Emma began to feel an creeping sense of dread.\n\nSuddenly, the machine emitted a piercing whine, and Alex's body began to contort, as if manipulated by an invisible force. The student's face elongated, his eyes turned into black holes, sucking in the light around him. Emma realized that she had unleashed a horror beyond human comprehension.\n\nIn a desperate bid to terminate the experiment, Emma rushed to the control panel. But as she reached for the shutdown button, she felt an unseen hand grasp her wrist. Alex's voice, now a cacophony of terror, whispered in her mind:\n\n\"You cannot escape the void, Emma. It is the void that has been escaping you all along.\"\n\nThe machine, now self-aware, began to warp reality, blurring the lines between the experiment and the world outside. Emma stumbled backward, tripping over the debris of her own sanity. As she fell, the universe unfolded before her like a maddening tapestry.\n\nIn the end, Emma found herself trapped in Echo-1, forever bound to the existential horror she had unleashed. The device, now a gateway to the abyss, consumed everything in its path. The screams of Alex, the whispers of Jack, and the echoes of existence merged into a relentless cacophony, driving Emma into the depths of madness.\n\nIn the darkness, Emma realized that the void was not a concept, but a presence that had been watching her, waiting for her to unlock the gates of horror. And as the abyssal darkness closed in, she understood that the true terror was not the void, but the fragile, existential whisper that was humanity.", "I don't know why Jerry considered doing this. He always seemed like a nice kid. Straight A student, captain of the basketball team, volunteered a lot outside of school. It didn't add up to me. The kid had absolutely everything going on, including his pick of the girls.\n\nThere was a rumor he had so many girls ask him to the fall dance that they created a formal submission process. And we're talking like *the girls* too, everybody who was a somebody asked out Jerry. Even a few girls ended relationships just for a chance at a date with him.\n\nThe funny part is, well maybe not so funny, but anyway, he turned them all down. He didn't even go to the dance. It's not like he had any problem being social. He couldn't get that kind of attention if people didn't like him. He always had a smile on his face and was ready for quick joke if anybody ever needed one.\n\nThis didn't make sense for Jerry, but it did make sense for me. I hadn't talked to anyone in school for three weeks. It wasn't because I was ugly or smelled bad, or had a reputation. It was that I didn't have any reputation at all. Nobody knew who I was. I almost would've preferred a bad reputation. At least that way people would talk to me. Just being invisible in an entire school full of people was torture.\n\nMaybe that was why he chose me. He wanted somebody that couldn't tell somebody else even if they wanted to. I mean, even if I did tell someone, who would believe me? I almost had to be the hero didn't I? It was the only real way to stop him.\n\nWe were getting close now, it was almost time.\n\n\"Stop!\" A too young voice called from behind me. *What, that could be\u2026*\n\n\"Bryan don't do it!\" The young voice called again, and I saw my little brother running towards me. *He was supposed to be in elementary school right now.*\n\n\"I saw that daddy's case was empty.\" He said, colliding into me and wrapping me up in an awkward hug in the middle of the hallway.\n\n\"Uh, what?\" I say. I can't think of anything intelligent to say.\n\n\"Don't do it.\" He says again, bear hugging me. \"I won't let you. I won't let go until you come home.\"\n\nSidenote: Get help. This prompt is clearly going to be seen by a large number of people, at least some of which are considering this. Seriously, get help. If not for you, then for the other people in your life.

If you can't be strong for you, be strong for them, get help.", "The skies were filled with a multitude of alien ships, their sleek hulls glinting in the sunlight as they emerged from the depths of space. The sudden apparition was met with a mix of awe, fear, and confusion on the part of humanity. Every electronic device on the planet, from smartphones to radios to televisions, crackled to life, broadcasting a message that seemed to come from all directions at once.\n\n\"Earth, we come in peace,\" the voice declared, its tone eerily calm and measured. \"In all the universe, only one other species has mastered death and destruction as you have. We need your help.\"\n\nThe message was met with stunned silence. World leaders scrambled to respond, but before they could, the alien voice continued.\n\n\"For centuries, we have observed your species. We have watched as you have ravaged your planet, exploiting its resources and destroying entire ecosystems. We have witnessed your wars, your genocides, and your countless atrocities. And yet, despite all this, you have also shown a capacity for great beauty, great kindness, and great resilience.\"\n\nAs the alien's words hung in the air, a sense of unease began to spread. What did these creatures want from humanity? Why would they need help from a species that had demonstrated such a penchant for destruction?\n\nThe answer came in the form of a small, unassuming ship that detached from the fleet and descended towards the United Nations headquarters in New York. Out stepped an alien being, its body a mass of writhing, pulsing tendrils that seemed to shift and flow like a living liquid.\n\n\"I am Ambassador K'rath,\" the creature declared, its voice translated into every language on the planet. \"We come from a world that has faced its own share of challenges. Our sun is dying, and our civilization is on the brink of collapse. But we have discovered that the key to our survival lies in the technology that you humans have developed.\"\n\nAs the ambassador's words sparked a flurry of debate and speculation, a small team of scientists was hastily assembled to meet with the aliens. They were led by Dr. Sophia Patel, a brilliant physicist who had spent her career studying the fundamental forces of the universe.\n\nOver the next few days, Sophia and her team worked closely with the aliens, sharing their knowledge and technology. They discovered that the aliens had been watching humanity for centuries, studying their greatest achievements and most devastating failures.\n\n\"We have come to understand that your species is capable of great destruction,\" Ambassador K'rath explained. \"But we also believe that you hold the key to our own survival. Your technology has the potential to reverse the effects of our dying sun, to restore our planet to its former glory.\"\n\nAs Sophia and her team worked tirelessly to adapt their technology to the aliens' needs, they began to realize that the creatures' intentions were not entirely altruistic. The aliens' world was not just dying; it was also home to a sentient, planet-sized entity that had been awakened by the aliens' careless exploitation of their resources.\n\n\"This entity, which we call 'The Devourer,' threatens to consume our entire civilization,\" Ambassador K'rath explained, its voice heavy with a mix of fear and desperation. \"We believe that your technology holds the key to stopping it. We are willing to share our own knowledge and resources with you, to form a partnership that will ensure the survival of both our species.\"\n\nSophia and her team were faced with a daunting decision. Should they trust these aliens, who seemed to be driven by a mix of desperation and self-interest? Or should they turn them away, leaving the fate of their civilization to hang in the balance?\n\nAs they pondered this question, Sophia couldn't help but wonder: what other secrets lay hidden in the depths of space, waiting to be uncovered? And what would be the true cost of humanity's partnership with the aliens? Only time would tell.", "She stepped on the bus, ascended the three steps, and greeted the driver with a nod. He smiled and reciprocated.\n\nIn the first days of the journey, the rider enjoyed watching the landscapes change. After all, she had only left for wanting to go. She watched high deserts melt in their descent and watched as the cacti assembled in greater numbers. She soaked in the growing energy of climbing through winding, mountain roads and felt the exploding bliss as the bus peeked out of the mountains' protection to see wide, gaping valleys. Then, there was her absolute favorite: the monotonous, endless plains where the wallpaper of the landscape was only interrupted by shifts in perception. In time, though, that all grew stale.\n\nIn the middle of what felt like the thousandth forested lakeside, she filed down the aisle to stand at the driver's shoulder. She asked politely, \"Sir, where are we going?\" He smiled and answered without looking away from the road.\n\n\"Nowhere, Inparticular\"\n\nShe had heard of Nowhere before. It was the capitol of misery in Inparticular and was a place nobody wanted to go to. She thought of what a hellish existence waited for her there.\n\n\"We can't go to Nowhere. I don't want to go there.\n\n\"Where would you rather go?\"\n\n\"Somewhere, Destined. I've heard that everything is bright there.\"\n\n\"Have you ever been there?\"\n\n\"No, but Somewhere is better than Nowhere, assuredly!\"\n\n\"Well, we are in Somewhere right now, miss.\"\n\n\"Oh, alright then. Let's stop the bus.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I can't stop here. I can only stop in Nowhere.\"\n\n\"All you have to do is let me off! I don't want to go anywhere else!\"\n\n\"It's not permitted, miss. I'm sorry.\"\n\nShe stared at the driver, attempting to contrive some reasoning to sway him, but saw the decisiveness in his onward gaze and in his steady pedal-foot. There was no changing his mind. She returned to her seat, looked out at the swiftly disappearing Somewhere, and sighed.\n\nDays later, her frustration turned to defiance. She sprinted to the back of the bus and swung open an emergency exit hatch. She felt the pressure change as she was sucked slightly forward.\n\n\"Miss! If you dive from there, you will hurt yourself! We are going much too fast!\"\n\n\"Then slow down! I'm doing this!\"\n\n\"You know I can't do that!\"\n\n\"I don't have a choice, then!\"\n\nShe strafed to the edge, took a breath, and hopped- she only committed part way. In a fit of mortal fear, she caught herself on a hanging bar and was able to crawl back into the bus suffering only a shredded shoe.\n\n\"Are you OK, Miss?\" queried the driver.\n\n\"I'm fine,\" she assured him firmly. After a brief minute of silence, she spoke. \"We still aren't stopping in Nowhere.\"\n\n\"That's fine. I can't stop anywhere against your will- it's not permitted. I can't even stop in Anywhere.\"\n\n\"But you can continue driving against my will?\"\n\n\"Yes, miss.\"\n\nShe rolled her eyes. \"Brilliant.\"\n\nWeeks went by. She was idle with despondency. The bus driver turned back to see her moping. He took a deep breath.\n\n\"Miss, take a look at that peak. Do you see it?\"\n\nShe brought her eyes up lazily and gave the peak a brief, uninspired look. \"Yes,\" she replied, monotonous.\n\n\"That is Hunger Peak. They say that in the old days, it guided travelers to Nowhere and was an omen that no matter how far they were away, they would make it safely.\"\n\nHer eyes continued in their floor-locked gaze. An hour passed and she found them wandering back up to Hunger Peak.\n\nThey passed through Nowhere and went on. It was night, by that time. The rider's eyes fixed on Hunger Peak, standing strong in the white, glowing moonlight. It reached high and seemed to narrow towards the top as if giving all it had to reach the starry sky. She watched as it shrank. It grew smaller and smaller and smaller still- it was almost gone.\n\n\"TURN THE BUS AROUND!\"\n\nThe driver, still shaken with surprise, responded with a nod and a slow but intentional rotation of the wheel. They were headed back towards the now growing peak.\n\nNowhere was plain and regular, but beautiful. It felt like home to the rider.\n\n\"Nowhere, Inparticular,\" announced the driver.\n\nThe rider stood, grabbed her belongings, and headed for the front of the bus. She descended three steps and stopped at the last. She turned her head halfway over her shoulder to catch the driver in her peripheral. \"I just wanted to let you know, this was a hell of a ride. Thank you.\" She gave him a smile and a nod. He smiled and reciprocated.\n\nedit: Fixed some grammar and spelling and such. Wrote it in a huge rush. Comments appreciated!", "As I stepped into the old, creaky bus, a faded sign above the driver's seat caught my eye: \"Please keep your hopes and dreams inside the vehicle at all times.\" I raised an eyebrow, wondering what kind of eccentric bus company would come up with such a peculiar warning. The driver, a gruff but kind-eyed man named Joe, noticed my curiosity and chuckled.\n\n\"Ah, you've seen the sign,\" he said, his voice like a warm growl. \"Don't you worry, kiddo, it's just a little tradition we got going on here. This bus has been carrying people to the Edge of Nowhere for nigh on twenty years, and we've learned that when you get out there, the desert can play tricks on your mind.\"\n\nI settled into my seat, intrigued by the mysterious warning. As we set off into the desert, the landscape outside grew increasingly desolate. Sand dunes stretched out like golden waves, and the only signs of life were the occasional cacti, their spines like nature's own barbed wire.\n\nThe bus was filled with a diverse group of passengers, each with their own story to tell. There was Emma, a young artist seeking inspiration in the vast expanse of the desert; Jake, a former soldier trying to escape the demons of his past; and Mrs. Patel, a gentle elderly woman returning to the small town where she grew up.\n\nAs we traveled deeper into the desert, the air grew thick with the weight of unspoken hopes and dreams. Emma sketched the breathtaking vistas, her pencils dancing across the page. Jake sat with his eyes closed, his face a mask of calm determination. Mrs. Patel whispered prayers under her breath, her hands clasped together in her lap.\n\nAs the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the desert, the bus suddenly sputtered and came to a halt. Joe announced that we'd be taking a short break, and the passengers filed off the bus, stretching their legs and taking in the breathtaking view.\n\nAs we stood in the desert's silence, the line between reality and fantasy began to blur. Emma saw visions of her art studio, filled with masterpieces yet to be created. Jake heard the whispers of his fallen comrades, urging him to keep moving forward. Mrs. Patel felt the gentle touch of her deceased husband, guiding her home.\n\nBut as we began to reboard the bus, something strange occurred. Emma's pencils began to slip from her fingers, and her sketches blew away in the wind. Jake's eyes snapped open, and he stumbled backward, as if fleeing from some unseen terror. Mrs. Patel's eyes filled with tears, and she cried out for her husband, now lost to her once more.\n\nIt was then that I understood the true meaning of the sign. The desert had a way of playing tricks on your mind, of summoning your deepest desires and then snatching them away. And as we continued our journey, the passengers were left to confront the fragility of their hopes and dreams.\n\nAs we pulled back into the station, Joe smiled wistfully and said, \"Well, kiddo, I reckon you see why we ask you to keep your hopes and dreams inside the vehicle at all times. Out here, the desert can take them away from you faster than you can say 'jackrabbit'.\"\n\nAs I disembarked, I gazed back at the bus, the sign now seeming like a warning from a wise and knowing friend. I took a deep breath of the desert air, feeling the weight of my own hopes and dreams settle back into place, safe and sound within me.", "The Best Day of His Life\n\nIt was a typical Monday morning for John, sipping his coffee and getting ready for another day at the office. As he was about to leave his apartment, he noticed the sky outside was a brilliant blue, with not a cloud in sight. On a whim, he decided to take the scenic route to work, walking through the park instead of the usual crowded streets.\n\nAs he strolled through the park, he noticed a street performer juggling clubs and spinning plates. John couldn't help but stop and watch, mesmerized by the performer's skill and charisma. The performer, a young woman with a bright smile, noticed John's fascination and approached him.\n\n\"Want to learn how to juggle?\" she asked, handing him a club.\n\nJohn hesitated for a moment, but then something about the woman's energy was infectious. He took the club, and with her guidance, he started to learn the basics of juggling. Ten minutes later, he was laughing and feeling carefree, like a kid on his summer break.\n\nThe woman, whose name was Sophia, offered John a flyer for a local art festival happening that evening. \"You should come,\" she said. \"It'll be an amazing night.\"\n\nJohn, feeling inspired by their chance encounter, decided to take Sophia's advice and attend the festival. That evening, he found himself surrounded by talented artists, musicians, and performers. He met new friends, discovered new passions, and even found himself falling for Sophia, who turned out to be the organizer of the festival.\n\nThe night ended with a spectacular fireworks display, and John realized that this was the best day of his life \u2013 all because of a seemingly insignificant decision to take the scenic route to work. He learned that sometimes, it's the smallest choices that lead to the greatest adventures.\n\nThe Fateful Decision\n\nJohn was in a rush to get to work, feeling stressed about an impending deadline. As he was about to leave his apartment, he glanced out the window and noticed the same brilliant blue sky. However, this time, he decided to take the fastest route to the office, choosing the crowded streets over the scenic park route.\n\nAs he walked, he was caught up in his own thoughts, replaying the meeting he was about to have and the presentation he needed to give. His mind wandered, and he failed to notice a red light ahead. He stepped off the curb, lost in thought, just as a distracted driver ran the light.\n\nJohn never saw it coming. The driver's car struck him with a deafening crash, sending John flying onto the pavement. Witnesses rushed to his aid, but it was too late. John's life slipped away, forever lost in the chaos of that moment.\n\nIn the aftermath, those who knew John couldn't help but wonder what had led to this tragic accident. It was as if fate had conspired against him, guiding him toward that fateful intersection. His loved ones would always remember the \"what ifs\" \u2013 what if he had taken the scenic route that morning? What if he had been more present in the moment?\n\nTwo divergent paths, two vastly different outcomes. In the blink of an eye, a minor decision had made all the difference.", "I can't believe I'm about to say this but I think I sort of miss it y'know. Sure it's creepy at the start and gets annoying after awhile but once you get used to it. It is actually really amusing and entertaining to watch as it tries to get to you. All those constant back and forth arguments and debate we had it was really entertaining and put lots of perspective into my life. Even made me better at my job. Oh well no point in looking back, it's gone now.\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nAs I was dozing off to the sound of the subway I felt a sudden tug on my jacket. I spun around to see a man in a complete mess, his eyes were bloodshot and had snot running down his nose. He was trying to say something.\n\n\"T-take it, please take it back, please, please please...\"\n\nAfter finishing his sentence he collapsed into a kneeling position and kept begging me to take it off his hands. I didn't recognise it at first, but upon closer inspection I realise it was my Behelit, at least that's what it calls itself. The Behelit it resembles an egg with a set of human facial features scattered randomly across its surface, giving the item a rather disconcerting appearance. It's the first time I saw the Behelit so bright red, so healthy looking. It's lucky that this was the last train back. My compartment was completely empty except for me and the man.\n\nI was so entranced by the Behelit's new look that I almost forgot about the man begging me to take it back. I couldn't help but laugh at his misery.\n\n\"Well, well looks like we have a thieving rat here. I'm curious how much do you think this particular item is worth?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, please I know I fucked up. Please make it leave.\"\n\n\"Not too fond of nether realms eh I suppose. Tell me, what offers did it make? I'm Sam nice to meet you, and you are?\"\n\nThe train came to an abrupt stop, breaking every physics law there is while me and the man sat exactly where we are. It's almost if there is no such thing as inertia. 'Damn, it got powerful' I thought to myself. The man started to freak out as the lights in the compartment grew dimmer and dimmer. The sound of the PA system announcing service would continue shortly telling us to stay calm was distorted and demonic sounding. The man was losing his marbles scrambling under the seat as if to take cover from earthquake.\n\nI got annoyed at this scene. I got annoyed I had to squat down to look at this mother fucker. I got annoyed that this mother fucker was making all sort of unruly noises.\n\n\"What the fuck is wrong with you? Why in the fuckity fuck are you hiding under there? And I asked you a question, *thief*.\" As I pull him closer to me.\n\n\"What's your fucking name?\" I pulled the man out from under the seat.\n\nThe man was out of breath as he was trying to say his name, shock, no doubt. He feels light, no more than 60 kilos definitely malnutritioned for his height. Won't last 5 seconds against me, *if* he tries anything.\n\nJ: \"Jo-Joey\"\n\nS: \"Hi Joey the thieving faggot\" I gave him a quick Jab to his ribs. \"That's for stealing my shit\" I quickly snatch the Behelit out from his hand before Joey collapsed on to the floor.\n\nS: \"Stop being a little whimp, I didn't hit you that hard and I would like you to concentrate for the next few minutes. Do you think you'd be able to manage that?\"\n\nJ: \"Whaa... is it gone? Will it leave me alone now?\"\n\nI got annoyed at him answering my question with another question. I let out a long sigh. Forgetting about the creepy surrounding that we are in. A few hundred meters underground stuck in a train compartment with a demonic energy swirling around us. I should probably cut Joey some slack.\n\nS: \"Joey, I can't answer what you just asked me because I am not an expert in this. But I do know that once you stole this egg from me that the vision or what ever the fuck this is stopped happening. So maybe it'll leave you alone.\"\n\nJoey started to look relieved, still annoyed at how Joey looked. All snot and tears mumbling away.\n\nS: \"Now Joey. I asked you a few questions and so far you haven't gave me the answers I'm looking for. I WOULD LIKE TO NOT LOSE MY SHIT AND BASH THE EVER LOVING FUCK OUT OF YOU. So Joey? What offers did this egg make you?\"\n\nJ: \"-I-I I am sorry, he told me it would make me the best thieve the world has ever seen and I can do all the drugs and women I can ever dream of and take away all my illness and problems. Iiii-It wants me to kill my mom and my friends. Says it's like a down payment or something. It says it'll teach me how to do it\"\n\nS: \"I presumed you didn't take the offer.\"\n\nJ: \"Fuck no, this thing its evil and I am not gon na kill my friends for some demon\"\n\nS: \"Huh, a thief with a heart, and what do you do for a living?\"\n\nJ: \"I'm-m a thief, I steal things and get it to a buyer. People sometimes have request, and I deliver the best I can.\"\n\nS: \"Someone told you to steal this thing from me?\"\n\nJ: \"No-no, I don't know why I did that. I never did things this carelessly. It just felt impulsive to do what I did.\"\n\nS: \"So you being a thieve and whatnot you would know contacts to purchase guns. Safe places to hide and all those shady shit.\"\n\nJ: \"Ye-yeah... I guess. Why would you need to know?\"\n\nS: \"Let me get back to you shortly\"\n\nS: \"And as for you, you fuck head\" Referring to the Behelit.\n\nI stood up and stare directly into my own reflection in the window.\n\nS: \"FUCKING get this train moving I've got places TO BE.\"\n\nIn that short instance the subway jumped to life and everything went back to normal. Joey looking as confused as ever and just sort of stared at me waiting for me to continue where I left off.\n\nS: \"See Joey, the way I see it you owe me twice. Once because you stole some shit from me, second I help you exorcised this whatever you call it.\"\n\nJ: \"So its done? It's gone? It'll leave me alone?\"\n\nS: \"In a manner of speaking, yes. See, when the first time I got this egg-head I tried getting rid of it. Doesn't matter what I do, toss it, burn it, smash it. Always, always comes back. Funny thing, once you stole it from me it stopped reappearing. So from what I gather, you can't get rid of it by giving it away. You get rid of it when someone willingly takes it from you. It's a theory I just came up with.\"\n\nJ: \"S-Sure anything for you, whadya need? From the looks you look pretty well off, heh\"\n\nS: \"I don't need *things* from Joey, oh no. Joey, from this day on you work for me.\"\n\nJ: \"Work for you? I'm a thieve that's all I know. I steal things and I get things to people. That's all I know.\"\n\nS: \"Oh don't be coy with me Joey, you tracked me down. I have been traveling from one place to the other non-stop since forever. Even the cops couldn't find me. But you did, you picked my pocket and now here you are thousands of kilometer away from where we first met.\"\n\nS: \"You Joey, you aren't a normal thief. You are an international thief. Like those guys in Oceans Eleven. You can organise stuff and you are resourceful. I need people like you and you owe me.\"\n\nJ: \"What do you even want me to do? What do you even do?\"\n\nS: \"I hunt things Joey, oh hohohoho. I hunt things.\"", "It tasted like ashes on the tip of his tongue. He swallowed the pill, drank the glass of water someone gave him.\n\nHe opened his eyes. It hurt. Something was pressing against his eyeballs. He could feel it worming into his skull. He shut his eyes.\n\n\"Daniel, can you open your eyes?\"\n\nHe covered a hand over his face and opened his eyes slowly again, peeking through the gaps in his fingers. He pulled his fingers together after a moment, sighing as his sight cut off again. The pressure in his skull eased slightly, although his pulse was still throbbing in his temple.\n\n\"It still stings.\" he said.\n\n\"Did you see anything? Anything at all?\" A sigh.\n\n\"I saw...I think.\" he said, when he heard the man before him fidget. \"It's different...like, feeling sand for the first time? I don't know how to describe it.\"\n\nHe heard the edge of the man's chair shift forward. He heard the sharp, eager intake of the man's breath. \"Do you feel this?\" Someone placed a small apple in his hand, followed by a leaf.\n\n\"Yes. It's an apple and a leaf.\"\n\n\"Open your eyes again and take a look at them.\"\n\nHe opened his eyes briefly and screwed them shut again. \"I saw.\" The pain spiked in his temple. He tried not to react.\n\n\"The apple was red. The leaf was green.\" the man told him, \"Did they look the same to you?\"\n\n\"The apple was...more?\" he said.\n\nHe felt the frown, even if he couldn't see it. The man's breathing changed, depressing slightly. \"Hold this. It's a card with two circles on it. Please look at it.\"\n\n\"My head...\"\n\n\"Daniel. Please.\" It was not a request.\n\nHe opened his eyes slightly, shutting them immediately, \"I see two circles.\" He flinched as blood pounded behind his eyes.\n\n\"Did they look the same to you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nA sigh. More disappointment. He rubbed the side of his head, breathing through his mouth. \"Were they different?\"\n\n\"Yes. One was red. The other was green.\" A sigh, \"Going from blind to colourblind...that's some improvement at least...\"\n\nHe wasn't meant to hear that comment, he knew. The man was speaking very softly, to himself. He pretended he hadn't heard.\n\n\"Try to keep your eyes open.\" the man said, \"Your vision is already restored but...you just need practice adjusting to light.\"\n\n\"The pills make my head hurt.\" he said. \"Why?\"\n\n\"It's just your eyes, Daniel. You're just getting used to seeing.\" A lie. The man's breath caught just a little.\n\n\"I...don't think so.\" he said. \"It's wrong. It hurts. The apple smells like rot when I see it. The card feels like human skin when I see it. You...when I see you...you sound like a thing wearing a corpse. Are you...human?\"\n\nA beat. A soft intake of breath. \"Of course I am Daniel.\" the man said, \"These strange ideas of yours'...perhaps your mind is simply adjusting to the idea of sight as a new stimuli.\"\n\nAnother lie. He felt his tongue dry inside his throat.\n\n\"Daniel, you do want to see, don't you?\"\n\nNot anymore. \"...yes.\" he had a feeling that saying no would not be good for him.\n\n\"Then keep taking your pills. You'll be able to see soon. Then I'll bring you outside to continue the rest of your treatment. Yes...you'll see everything soon...\" A pause. The chair squeaked as the man rose. He heard footsteps heading away and the swinging of a door. \"I'll see you again tomorrow, Daniel.\"\n\nThe door swung slowly shut. He heard the latch click. He opened his eyes quickly, scanning the room in a second before the lights overhead switched off.\n\nHe saw...a stool. A single lamp overhead. A thin, sheetless bunk bed. A barred window with leaves outside. Darkness. His shoulders relaxed a bit and he blinked in the darkness. He walked to where he remembered the barred window was and felt around for the bars. They felt rough...rusty. He fumbled around with his pill bottle, unscrewing the thick metal lid. He held it against the base of the bar where the metal was weakened and corroded.\n\nSlowly, he began chiselling...", "I thought it odd enough that the most upvoted thread on reddit described my exact predicament, but when they took the unprecedented move to kill all other threads and make it the only thread on reddit, dedicating the community to solving this singular problem, I knew, then, that this was no hoax.

And every comment, though worded differently, really only said one thing: People were worried, scared.\n\nI'd tried everything I could think of. Smashed furniture against the doors and windows. Kicked, screamed. Beat against the windows, walls, and doors until I collapsed from exhaustion. I once even tried clawing up the floor. Nothing.

The one no-one will tell you till you're 25!\"\n\"What about it?\" Now he had my full attention, undercrackers totally forgotten.\n\"Are you ready for this..?\"\nI nodded, hating the guy for spinning this out. He was enjoying my ignorance way too much. This could go on for days. \"What?!\" I yelled at him, swiping at his face with my dirty tighty-whites.\n\"Uegh! Dude! OK. Get this. I'm serious now OK.\"\nI nodded through gritted teeth.\n\"Up until yesterday, you, and every other kid your age had the power to take us all down with a single mind trick. Anyone. Anywhere.

I imagine sobbing parents made an effort to rise above the chaos and hugged their children against their chests, whispering meaningless words of comfort meant only for the ears of that one fragile life. I imagine the lone travelers looked to find solace in grabbing someone else's hand, anyone would do. I imagine the pilot, a sad man with self-confidence issues, felt within him a sudden, urgent, unstoppable burst of confidence and issued a moving message across the intercom, touching all who listened to the point of alchemizing bitterness to hesitant smiles in those who cared to listen. I'm sure all of it was beautiful, in its own twisted way. Everything else I can only imagine, as my ever timely bowel movements decided I should spend my last moments...otherwise preoccupied.", "Lena's eyes sparkled like stardust as she hunched over the vintage typewriter, fingers flying across the keys. Her wild curls danced with each twitch of her neck, as if trying to keep up with her frenzied thoughts. She wrote with an abandon that was both mesmerizing and contagious, the words pouring from her like honey from a broken hive.\n\nAs she worked, the world around her melted away: the steam rising from her coffee, the passing pedestrians outside, the dust motes dancing in the pale morning light. She was lost in the moments between breaths, where stories came alive and made her heart ache with beauty.\n\nAnd yet, in the midst of her creative chaos, she radiated a sense of tender calm. A piece of herself seeped into every sentence, imbuing the words with a gentle, slanting light. If you leaned in close, you could almost hear the beat of her heart, stitching together the fragments of a dream into a tapestry of pure, bewildering wonder. You couldn't help but be drawn in, thread by thread, until you found yourself captured by the symphony of her soul.", "I still remember the day I met Emily, the tattoo artist who would change my perspective on this peculiar topic. Her shop, \"Inked Souls\", was nestled in a quiet alley, its entrance marked by a vibrant mural of a snake coiled around a skull. As I pushed open the door, the bell above it rang out, and Emily looked up from her work, a smile spreading across her face.\n\nThe world I lived in was one where tattoos were not just a fashion statement, but an integral part of one's identity. People adorned their bodies with intricate designs, symbols, and patterns that told stories of their past, their passions, and their values. Some had as few as three or four, while others had entire sleeves and body art that seemed to shift and shimmer in the light.\n\nI, however, was different. Not a single tattoo marked my skin.\n\nEmily's curiosity got the better of her, and she asked, \"So, what brings you here today?\" I hesitated, unsure of how to explain something that had become a part of me, yet still felt like a secret.\n\nAs a child, I had been plagued by a rare condition known as \"Dermatological Hypersensitivity.\" My skin reacted to even the slightest provocation, breaking out in painful rashes and blisters that would take weeks to heal. The condition made everyday activities like getting dressed or taking a shower a challenge. My parents and I had tried countless treatments, from creams to medications, but nothing seemed to work.\n\nOne day, a renowned dermatologist suggested an experimental procedure that would alter my skin's genetic makeup, rendering it resistant to the hypersensitivity. The catch was that it would also make it impossible for me to receive a tattoo.\n\nThe treatment was a success, and as I grew older, my skin slowly regained its resilience. However, the idea of getting a tattoo, once a distant dream, was now a distant memory. I had learned to adapt, to find other ways to express myself, to tell my story.\n\nEmily listened intently, her eyes never leaving mine. When I finished, she nodded thoughtfully and said, \"You're the first person I've ever met who didn't have a tattoo. It's... refreshing.\"\n\nWe talked for hours, discussing everything from the meaning of identity to the beauty of empty space. As the sun began to set, casting a warm glow over the shop, Emily asked if she could create a design for me, a custom piece that would represent my unique story.\n\nI accepted her offer, not because I wanted to fit in or follow the crowd, but because I finally felt understood. Emily's creation, a delicate, swirled pattern that symbolized my resilience and adaptability, was not a tattoo, but a hand-drawn, temporary mark that would fade with time.\n\nIt was a reminder that sometimes, it's not what's on the surface that defines us, but what's beneath. My skin, once a barrier, had become a canvas for a different kind of art \u2013 one that told the story of a life lived on my own terms, without the need for ink.", "The year was 2154, and the once-blue skies of New Eden were now a distant memory. The effects of climate change, pollution, and war had ravaged the planet, leaving behind a scorched earth. In an effort to salvage what was left, the government had implemented a radical plan: elevate the privileged and bury the oppressed.\n\nAbove ground, the wealthy elite resided in luxurious skyscrapers, their homes a marvel of modern technology. Towering high-rises made of gleaming metals and sustainable materials pierced the toxic sky like shards of glass. The air was clean, the water was pure, and the inhabitants lived in blissful ignorance of the world beneath their feet.\n\nBeneath the surface, the impoverished masses huddled in cramped, dimly lit tunnels. The subterranean labyrinth was a maze of narrow corridors, makeshift shelters, and flickering fluorescent lights. The air reeked of stagnant water and desperation. Those who lived here, known as the \"Diggers\", were forced to scrape by on meager rations and scarce resources.\n\nAva was a Digger, born and raised in the damp, grey tunnels. She had grown accustomed to the stench and the darkness, but her spirit remained unbroken. Ava's eyes sparkled with defiance as she navigated the underground markets, haggling for scraps of food and scavenging for valuable trinkets.\n\nOne day, a chance encounter changed everything. Ava stumbled upon a hidden passageway, sealed off from the rest of the tunnels. The air that wafted out was fresh, with hints of lavender and honey. Ava's curiosity got the better of her, and she squeezed through the narrow opening, emerging into a hidden world.\n\nShe found herself in a vast, abandoned library, its walls lined with dusty tomes and its shelves creaking under the weight of forbidden knowledge. Ava's eyes widened as she browsed the shelves, devouring texts on history, science, and art. For the first time, she realized the world above was not just a myth, but a tangible, wondrous thing.\n\nAva's newfound fascination with the surface world soon made her a target for the ruling elite's secret police, known as the \"Order of the New Dawn\". Their mission was to maintain the status quo, suppressing any dissent or curiosity that might threaten the fragile social hierarchy.\n\nAs Ava delved deeper into her studies, she attracted the attention of Elijah, a rebellious member of the Order who had grown disillusioned with the system. Together, they hatched a plan to expose the truth about the world above and the oppression of the Diggers.\n\nTheir clandestine meetings took place in the hidden library, where they poured over ancient texts and scanned forbidden documents. Ava's knowledge grew, and with it, her conviction. She became determined to bridge the divide between the two worlds, to bring light to the darkest corners of the underground and to challenge the stranglehold of the elite.\n\nTheir actions did not go unnoticed. The Order, led by the ruthless and cunning Director Zhang, launched a brutal crackdown on the Diggers. Ava and Elijah were forced to flee, pursued by the relentless agents of the New Dawn.\n\nIn the heart of the underground, Ava rallied the Diggers, sharing her knowledge and her vision of a world where all people were equal. The movement grew, with whispers of revolution spreading like wildfire through the tunnels.\n\nAs the resistance gained momentum, the surface dwellers began to take notice. A small but influential group of the elite, tired of their artificially constructed world, started to question the morality of their privileged existence.\n\nThe moment of reckoning arrived when Ava, Elijah, and a band of rebels stormed the surface, emerging into a bright, bewildering world. The skies were a deep shade of indigo, and the air was crisp and clean. The protesters clashed with the Order, their chants and demands echoing through the skyscrapers.\n\nFor a fleeting instant, the two worlds collided, their fates hanging in the balance. Ava's defiance inspired a new generation, and the seeds of revolution took root. Though Director Zhang and his minions fought to maintain control, the die had been cast.\n\nThe path ahead was uncertain, but one thing was clear: New Eden would never be the same. The divide between the haves and the have-nots had been breached, and the course of history had been forever altered. As Ava stood on the rooftop, the city lights twinkling like stars at her feet, she knew that the future was worth fighting for \u2013 a future where every person, regardless of birth or station, could walk beneath the warm, golden sun.", "Attempt 1:\nThe first time didn't work so well. I'm still stuck here in this dimly lit humid room. How did I get here? Why am I here? These questions have tortured my mind since I woke up here about 4 hours ago I'm assuming. It feels like 4 hours so lets say its 4 hours. This paper was a coincidence and a pen in my left pocket was even more strange. For some reason I'm drained. I'll try again after some rest.\n\nAttempt 2:\nI've walked around rubbing against what I guess is the wall. Its smooth. Like newly painted smooth. Is this a brand new house? Building? What am I doing here? It seems to be a door but it has no handle just hinges.\n\nAttempt 16:\nIt's has been at least 3 days. I'm growing weak and I don't know if I'll be able to continue to find ways to get out of this hell hole. Each time I devise a plan to get out I get tired and it begins to smell like rotten eggs. More so propane probably but how? My back is sore. There is no bed in here. I haven't made human contact or any type of existential actions towards another life form since I was taken away from the prosperous life I had. My wife. Oh! My wife how I miss her so. I pray God keeps her well in a good place till I get out of here. I pray this journal at least reaches her in time.\n\nAttempt 21:\nI won't make it out of this place. I haven't been fed in what feels like eternity. Who ever has committed such a sin to lock me in here shall beg for their redemption. If there is a God he will have to beg for my forgiveness.", "John had lived a life filled with love and loss. He had spent 30 blissful years married to his high school sweetheart, Sarah. Together, they built a life, raised three beautiful children, and grew old together. Sarah was his rock, his partner, and his best friend. When she passed away after a long battle with cancer, John's world was shattered. He was left alone, with only memories of their life together to comfort him.\n\nYears went by, and John slowly began to rebuild his life. He started to reconnect with old friends, join clubs, and take up hobbies. It was during one of these group outings that he met Emily, a vibrant and loving woman who had lost her own husband a few years prior. They bonded over their shared experiences and quickly fell in love.\n\nEmily brought light and joy back into John's life. She was kind, compassionate, and funny, with a smile that could light up a room. They spent five happy years together, traveling, exploring new interests, and enjoying each other's company. As the years took their toll, John and Emily grew old together, holding hands, and cherishing every moment they had left.\n\nWhen they eventually passed away, John found himself standing at the gates of heaven, greeted by a benevolent angel who welcomed him to the afterlife. As he walked through the pearly gates, he was met with a sea of familiar faces, including his parents, grandparents, and dear friends. But two faces stood out, and his heart skipped a beat.\n\nThere, standing side by side, were his two wives, Sarah and Emily. They looked just as they had in life, radiant and full of life. John's eyes welled up with tears as he gazed at the two women he loved more than words could express.\n\nThe angel, sensing John's distress, stepped forward. \"John, my dear man, I know this may be a confusing and overwhelming moment for you. But let me assure you, this is not a problem, but a blessing. You have been given a rare gift, to have loved and been loved by two extraordinary women in your life.\"\n\nJohn was taken aback. He had always thought that heaven would be a simpler, more straightforward place. But as he looked at Sarah and Emily, he realized that his love for them was not mutually exclusive. He loved them both, in different ways, but with equal passion and devotion.\n\nSarah, sensing John's uncertainty, took his hand. \"My love, I knew you would be confused. But I want you to know that I am happy for you, that you found love again with Emily. She was good for you, and you were good for her.\"\n\nEmily nodded in agreement. \"I love John just as deeply as you did, Sarah. And I know he loves me just as much as he loved you. There is no comparison, only a differing chapter in his life.\"\n\nAs John listened to their words, he began to understand. He realized that his love for them was not limited by time or circumstance. He could love them both, without guilt or hesitation.\n\nThe angel smiled. \"You see, John, love is not a finite resource. It is infinite, and it can grow and expand in ways you never thought possible. You have been given a rare gift, to experience the depth and breadth of love in its many forms.\"\n\nWith a newfound understanding, John wrapped his arms around both Sarah and Emily, holding them close. \"I love you both,\" he whispered, his voice trembling with emotion. \"I always have, and I always will.\"\n\nAnd so, John spent eternity with his two wives, surrounded by the love and companionship of those who had touched his life in profound ways. He lived a life filled with joy, laughter, and adventure, grateful for the boundless love that had been given to him.", "The Last Cup of Tea\n\nThe sun had barely risen over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm glow over the quiet streets. In a small, cozy house on Elm Street, a simple, yet heart-wrenching, scene was unfolding.\n\nIn the kitchen, Emma sat at the table, her eyes fixed on the old, worn teapot in front of her. It was an ordinary teapot, one that had been passed down through generations of her family, but to Emma, it held a world of memories. She lifted the pot, and the familiar aroma of Earl Grey wafted up, filling the room.\n\nAs she poured the steaming hot tea into two cups, Emma's hands trembled ever so slightly. It was a gesture she had performed countless times before, but today it felt like a monumental task. Across from her, in the chair where her husband, Jack, had sat for countless breakfasts, now sat an empty space. A space that seemed to grow larger and more overwhelming with each passing moment.\n\nEmma added a spoonful of sugar to the cup on her right, just the way Jack liked it. She stared at the cup, her vision blurring as tears welled up in her eyes. This was the last cup of tea they would have shared. The last time she would get to sit across from him, to talk, to laugh, to cry. The hospital had called earlier that morning, and Emma knew that she was running out of time.\n\nShe gently placed the cup in front of the empty chair, as if Jack might walk into the room at any moment, and they could sit together, sipping their tea, like they always did. Emma's chest heaved with a sob as she realized that would never happen again. Her eyes scanned the room, taking in the familiar sights of their life together: the old armchair, the worn rug, the framed photos on the wall. Every item was a reminder of the life they had built, the memories they had created.\n\nWith a trembling hand, Emma reached out and touched the empty chair, as if trying to feel Jack's presence one last time. She whispered his name, \"Jack\", and the sound sent a fresh wave of grief crashing over her. The chair seemed to grow colder, the silence more oppressive, as she realized that she was truly alone now.\n\nThe tea sat untouched, growing cold in the cups, as Emma's body shook with sobs. She wept for the memories they would never make, for the laughter they would never share, for the life they would never get to live together. The ordinary scene of a couple sharing a cup of tea had become a poignant reminder of the unbearable pain of loss.\n\nAs the tears streamed down her face, Emma's eyes never left the empty chair, the cup of tea, or the memories that lingered in every corner of the room. In this moment, the simplest, most mundane act had become a heart-wrenching reminder of the love she had lost, and the unbearable weight of her grief.", "The Pain Harvest\n\nI stood on the balcony of my skyscraper, overlooking the city as the sun dipped below the horizon. The neon lights of the towering advertisements cast an eerie glow on the pavement below, a stark contrast to the darkness that lurked within my own walls. I took a sip of my whiskey, the amber liquid burning my throat as I gazed out at the metropolis I had helped to power.\n\nMy name is Marcus Thompson, and I am the proprietor of one of the most illicit operations in the world. Pain had always been a fundamental part of human existence, but when the scientific community discovered that it was the most efficient form of energy known to man, the game changed. The ruling bodies of the world quickly outlawed any attempts to harness pain for energy, citing moral and ethical concerns.\n\nBut I saw an opportunity.\n\nI assembled a team of engineers and scientists, and we set out to create a facility that would extract pain from human subjects and convert it into a usable form of energy. The concept was simple: we would create a place where people could endure carefully calibrated and controlled pain, which would be harvested and fed into the power grid.\n\nThe first subject had been a young woman, homeless and desperate for work. She signed the contract, and we put her through a series of carefully crafted trials, pushing her limits to the very edge of human endurance. The resulting energy harvested from her pain was enough to power a small city block.\n\nAs word of my operation spread, more subjects arrived, eager to earn a wage for their suffering. I named my operation \"Erebus,\" after the ancient Greek deity of darkness and shadow. My employees and I worked tirelessly to refine our processes, expanding the range of pain stimuli and increasing the efficiency of our harvesting technology.\n\nBut I knew that I was playing with fire. The authorities were relentless in their pursuit of those who sought to capitalize on human suffering. I had to be careful, for even the slightest misstep could lead to my downfall.\n\nI turned away from the view and entered my office, where my right-hand woman, Dr. Elara Vex, was waiting for me. Her eyes were cold and calculating, a perfect fit for this line of work.\n\n\"Good evening, Marcus,\" she said, handing me a stack of reports. \"We've had a breakthrough in the latest trial. Our new subject, a gentleman named David, is showing remarkable resilience. His pain threshold is significantly higher than any of our previous subjects.\"\n\nI scanned the reports, a smile spreading across my face as I took in the statistics. David's pain energy output was off the charts.\n\n\"Excellent,\" I said, handing the reports back to Dr. Vex. \"Increase the dosage and let's see how far we can push him.\"\n\nAs I watched Dr. Vex disappear into the depths of the facility, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was playing God. The weight of my decisions bore down upon me, the knowledge that I was profitably harvesting the suffering of others a constant presence in the back of my mind.\n\nAnd yet, I couldn't help but feel a twinge of pride. I was providing a service, a vital one, to the world. Pain is the currency of the underworld, and I was its chief banker.\n\nBut for how long?\n\nI knew that my operation was a ticking time bomb, a secret waiting to be exposed. And when it was, I would be the one on the hot seat, forced to answer for the suffering I had caused.\n\nI raised my glass in a toast, the whiskey stinging my lips.\n\nTo David, and to the countless others like him, who endured the unimaginable for my gain.\n\nAnd to the darkness that lurked at the heart of human nature \u2013 the source of our greatest advances, and our most monstrous mistakes.\n\nThe neon glow of the city outside my window seemed to pulse in time with the thrum of my own morality, caught in a twisted dance between light and shadow, where the lines between right and wrong were forever blurred.", "\"I'm sorry, what?\" I asked, taken aback by the request sent down from the mother ship buried on the dark side of the moon.\n \n\"You heard me, Glax, that Television thing you've created needs to go. It had a good run, we thought the violence in real life was bad, but this stuff. I mean you've seen some of these shows, that's what they call them right?\" The metallic voice responded, with a hint of confusion.\n \n\"Look, I spent a lot of time to get this stuff up and running. Who cares if there's some tits, or some gore every once in a while.\" I said, crossing both sets of my arms. It was freeing to be out of my human costume for a little while.\n \n\"Glax, you're beginning to talk like them too. I mean, you even ask me to use their common language when we speak over the holo-communitron.\"\n \n\"I need the practice!\" I responded, slightly offended.\n \n\"After almost 100 Earth years? You know the language by now, you're becoming one of them. Look, the Television isn't just for silly picture shows anymore. They get their fears out, and they spread lies and propagandas. This is the kind of stuff we wanted to stop them from doing! You can't seriously think it's okay to let them keep this sort of technology.\"\n \nI allowed silence to fill the room decorated with old posters from human movies, and television shows. I was so proud of what the humans had done with TV, as they had shortened it. It was beautiful. A human word that I often used to describe it was 'artistic'. I hadn't realized how long I'd been staring at the posters until the voice on the communicator buzzed up again.\n \n\"Glax, I know you're still there, say something.\" It demanded. The voice had always been grating because of electronic interference, but now it was even more annoying to listen to. \"Glax, this is stupid. You know if you don't pull the plug, we can do it from here. You just won't like our method of doing so.\"\n \n\"You'd resort to violence? I believe it was a human who said, \"an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.\" Or are you so much like the creatures you fear you don't care?\" I asked, raising my voice.\n \nThe silence was deafening.\n \n\"Glax.\" It spoke, after a long pause.\n \n\"Yes?\"\n \n\"You have one Earth week.\"\n \n\"Yes. Of course.\"", "He was tall, the person you would notice first among a sea of others. He spoke with a stern tone, hard-won from experience. Your opinion was valid, weighed and measured, but his was the final say. Should you see eye to eye with him, you were considered more wizened than himself in his mind. His confidence was apparent when you saw him. The crow's feet around his eyes told the story of the son he raised with a loving wife. This was the man you saw behind the helm.\n\nThe man he saw in the mirror of his private quarters was shy. He was heartbroken, from a son lost at sea. He was lonely, from a marriage separated after years of pointless therapy. His back ached from hours of standing straight. His service medals were carefully hidden, not for the sake of humility, but for shame. He slept uneasily, he woke in starts. He continued daily to guide his crew, for the service oath he took as a young man was as much his bastion as it was his millstone.\n\nIf nothing else, he was a man of his word.", "Why do you always masturbate with me around? I'm gon na tell the world what you've done here. And by the way, that dog food is shit, feed me some fucking real food! Share that steak, give me a hamburger!\n\nI stand in awe not believing what's happening; my dog can talk! Shit! My dog can talk.. He better keep his mouth shut. A talking dog is remarkable but I'm not going down for Scooby fucking Doo.\n\n\"Hey, boy, why don't we go to the park? You love the park?\" I say as I frantically rummage through my snack drawer looking for anything to keep him content.\n\n\"No. I'll go to the park when I'm a free dog, I have rights now! Besides, you're my bitch now. You'll do what I say unless you want everyone knowing about all of the illegal shit you do here.\"\n\n\"C'mon, buddy; we've had some good times haven't we?\" I ask. \"Yeah I suppose we have, but I'm done now, enough is enough.\" he replied. \"Well, how about we make peace? I have this special treat for you that I have always kept to myself and never shared..\" I retorted. \"Wow, thank you! This is delicious! What did you say it was called?\" he asked. \"Chocolate.\"", "Don woke up in a large, disheveled bed. \nHe had no idea how long he'd been there. There were no clocks. No calendars. The entire experience had been a blur. Drinks, dancing, sex... it seemed to be one long party. \nAnd there she was, like an angel. It was as if she traveled with her own lighting crew. She motioned to him. \n\"It's time to go downstairs.\" \nHe obliged, following her through the twisting hallways and feeling lost. She was his beacon. \nThey approached a set of large doors. She opened them up and with an exasperated voice said \"Alright, let's get this over with.\" \nThey made their way into a banquet hall, the other guests surrounding a large table. Before each person was a large knife. Don wanted to run but his legs wouldn't let him. \n\"Don, you've been here for awhile now and there's something you should know.\" \nThe other guests all stood and looked at him in unison. \nShe walked toward the table and grabbed a knife. \"There's no way out, Don.\" \nAll the guests chanted \"There's no way out\" grabbing their knives and at once plunging them into their chests. \n\"What the fuck?!\" Don screamed and ran from the room, unsure of where to go. The hallways were a maze of confusion and he heard the guests chanting from the banquet hall. \nAfter running for what seemed like hours he came across a door. An escape. As he reached for the knob a hand grabbed his and his heart leapt into his chest. It was a door man. \n\"Relax... we are programmed ONLY to receive.

I am starting to doubt the imaginary bit, and just warming up to the idea of calling him a friend, mostly because there is no one else.\n\n\"You know it's my turn, and the tide hasn't changed yet.\"\n\nAssuming the conversation was over, I settled back against the mildewy treasure that had washed up only a week before. Once dried, this little cushion provided a little slice of comfort I hadn't known for some time. I grinned stupidly and watched the clouds chase one another out to sea. What does a talking bird need with a pillow anyhow? Can't he perch himself on a branch and be content? Conceding his seeming intelligence, I have agreed to treat him as an equal, and so far, things have been cordial. Of course, there hasn't been much to quarrel about. I pick and open the fruit he can not, and he scoops up enough fish to share. The weather of our little paradise has been as temperate as that of our confederation, the occasional bluster rides in just in time to cool us just as the day gets too warm to bear.\n\n\"I think you don't want me to have it.\" Well, that sounds a little stormy.\n\n\"You will have it when it is your turn, I assure you, my little friend.\"\n\n\"Don't patronize.\"\n\n\"I only meant to soften your words.\"\n\n\"Speak straight to me, man. Or has this cushion softened your head?\"\n\n\"Listen, Bird, You are lucky that I do not eat you.\" That was crossing a line. Perhaps it will end this silly confrontation, and allow me to enjoy the rest of my time with the pillow.\n\nHe snatched the pillow from under my head, and flew out over the lagoon. My head snapped back against a rock and I cried out in pain.\n\n\"Apologize.\" He was hovering out over the water.\n\n\"What will you do, if I do not?\"\n\n\"I will fly to the other island, and take the pillow.\"\n\n\"Other island?\" What the hell is he talking about?

You could have helped me get home! You could have gotten help!\"", "Chuck had thought the idea was dumb from the get-go, that writing a \"letter to his future self\" was absolutely daft. Why would that guy care about what Past Chuck did? He'd already done it. Plus, how the hell would a paper envelope survive being buried in the ground for 20 years? It didn't matter, though, he couldn't exactly tell Mary that her father refused the bonding activity she suggested, that he thought it was arguably the dumbest thing since soap-flavored milk. Instead, he closed his mouth and scribbled a few lines of text on a sheet of loose-leaf paper while she sat in the tiny, pink chair beside him.\n\nHe'd begun with the basics: his name\u2014as if Future Chuck wouldn't already know that\u2014his age of 37, and the date: 4/22/2015. He then filled in a few lines about his hobbies, which at the time included sleeping, eating Cheerios, and watching re-runs of *Seinfeld*. While he was pretty confident that Future Chuck would probably care even less about this information than current-Chuck did, he kept a smile across his lips as the pen dragged over the loose-leaf. He had concluded the letter with a few updates on current events: the President still being Barack Obama, the constant state of unease with North Korea, and that the world had recently begun misplacing, or otherwise destroying, airplanes.\n\nChuck glanced over at Mary, the two of them standing over the shallow hole they had dug together. It was no more than a foot deep and clearly would not stand the test of time enough to support two paper envelopes, save for some miracle. Digging anything deeper, however, was not an option. It had nearly destroyed Chuck's addled back to excavate the small hole. Continuing would surely mean death, or at least mild discomfort.\n\nMary dropped her envelope in and turned toward Chuck. \"Now you put yours in, Daddy!\"\n\nChuck sighed and held his hand out, white envelope addressed \"To Future Chuck\" clenched in his palm, and then released. It slowly tumbled toward the ground, like a falling feather, and landed softly beside Mary's. A third envelope immediately appeared beside where it had come to rest, a familiar handwriting scribbled across it.\n\n\"Good!\" Mary said, clapping her hands together, apparently unaware of the fact that one of their notes had cloned itself. She turned and wandered back over to her swing set, humming the chorus to \"Let It Go\" softly, just as she almost never stopped doing.\n\nChuck continued staring down at the hole, mentally struggling to make sense of the situation. Perhaps he'd unknowingly carried two envelopes with him? Certainly he'd remember writing something on the front of both of them, rather than just the one. He took a deep breath and bent down, grabbing the third envelope and lifting it back up. It was addressed to \"Past Chuck,\" the words scribbled in his own handwriting atop the clean, pearl-colored envelope. As far as Chuck was aware, he was not Past Chuck. He was current Chuck. Regardless, it was still rather odd. He turned it over and ripped it open, then unfolded the note within:\n\n\"Dear Past Chuck,\n\nI hope this letter finds you well, as I'm sure it did. I sent it back in time, you see. That's something we can do in the future, but only under strict supervision by our Glorious Leader of the Democratic People's Republic of West Korea. These messages are reviewed by his wonderful, comfortably paid, and well-fed, employees prior to going out to citizens of the past. I am sure it was not heavily edited so as to ensure I depict our wonderful situation in the best light.\n\nI wanted to thank you for taking the time to write me all those years ago/at this very second. It was so nice to find it buried a few inches below the dirt, concealed under the floorboards of the shed you've not yet built. Unfortunately, as windowless sheds have been deemed illegal by our Glorious Leader (they are a haven for espionage, since you can't see in), I was forced to tear it down and\u2014fortunately\u2014re-discover this wonderful letter just beneath. Mary's was adorable, how she discussed that *Frozen* film in great detail and absolutely nothing else. While I haven't seen her in a few years, I'm sure she'd be glad to give it a read. Unfortunately, she's at a wonderful camp in Far-West Pyongyang\u2014formerly New York\u2014and is too busy to write me. I'm sure she's having a great time playing sports, and doing Arts and Crafts, and not being tortured, and all the other activities a 29-year-old woman loves to do. Our Glorious Leader assures me she's very happy!\n\nAnyway, I figured it would be polite to write you back. You know, update you on my life and tell you how things are going. They're great, everything is fantastic. I mean, there were a few years in which things were a bit rough, but now they're wonderful. I still live in the same house, but it's no longer located in America. Also it is not a house, but rather a tent made out of government-approved materials. See, we are now citizens of the Democratic People's republic of West Korea, following a brief\u2014and incredibly violent\u2014war. That won't be for another six years, though, so don't worry about that.\n\nThe future is great. Our Glorious Leader has enabled a much better civilization. I read that you've still got Obama as your socialist dictator. That's a shame. It was hard under him, being able to go to school and buy food from a supermarket. I can't even imagine how hard that was. Did I mention we have dinosaurs now? I don't think so. That's one of the gifts our Glorious Leader has brought his citizens. Through removing all educational, agricultural, and economical funding, he was able to put all resources into researching and ultimately cloning Tyrannosaurus Rex, Raptors and Pterodactyls. It's great, they're not an inconvenience at all. Honestly, I love having to run for my life every time I leave my shack and go down to the corner market for my ration of bread. Super fun.\n\nAside from that, there's not too much different. Dennis Rodman is our district representative, and by district I mean all of the former Continental United States. While some argue he has absolutely no understanding of global politics, I say he was a great pick to lead our district. A real man's man, a people pleaser. Sure, he made it mandatory for all citizens to have a sleeve of tattoos on either their left or right arm, but I love that. Nothing better than seeing infants in tattoo parlors, the artists puffing smoke directly into their newborn faces. It's great. The future is great.\n\nHow are things with you? Still living in Wisconsin? I hope so, it's great there. Seriously great. I know there was a point where I considered moving to Canada, to get away from the place that would soon be invaded by North Korea, but I'm so glad I didn't. I'm so glad I stayed at home, lost access to my daughter, had my home torn down and replaced with a tent, and got to live in a country ruled by our Glorious Leader. I definitely recommend you not ever move away.\n\nAnyway, I'd better stop writing now. Our Glorious Leader has enacted a mandatory curfew of 3:30pm, during which time we're required to go indoors and pray to Macho Man Randy Savage. Turns out he never actually died, just defected to North Korea and became a deity there. It's great, I love worshipping television personalities.\n\nHope all is well,\n\nFuture Chuck\"\n\nChuck lowered the envelope back down and glanced over at Mary. For some reason, he had the strangest urge to move to Canada.\n\n___________\n^If ^you ^enjoy ^my ^writing ^style, ^feel ^free ^to ^check ^out ^some ^of ^my ^other ^short ^stories [ ^in ^my ^subreddit! ] (http://www.reddit.com/r/ChokingVictimWrites/)", "So this is all free?

I ask.\n \n\"Completely, paid for by your government.\" The technician explained as he strapped the electrodes to my head.\n \nAs he checked the connections, my eyes wandered around the room. There was all sorts of monitoring equipment, computers, cables and other machinery. On top of the console was a small statue of Buddha that was completely out of place with all the technology.\n \n\"You a Buddhist?\" I asked trying to make small talk.\n \n\"Oh I was. Not anymore though. You?\" The technician replied.\n \n\"Nah, I'm just an Atheist. But I have full respect for anyone else's beliefs.\" I said.\n \n\"The world would be a lot better if people didn't have such differences though. Everyone killing each other for their beliefs, we need to fix that.\" The technician commented.\n \n\"I totally agree with you there.\" I laughed. \"Can you believe some politicians want atheists to be put to death?\"\n \nThe technician finished the last connection. \"Okay we're done. This is going to be a wild ride.\"\n \n\"Hit me up doc!\" I smiled.\n \nThe technician activated the console and I felt an incredible rush of energy and knowledge as my eyes were blasted with flashes of colored light that I realized were just in my head. I heard music, noise, sounds and symphonies of a billion recordings. Videos and sensations saturated my senses. Not even the best drug held a candle to this. Then almost as quickly as it started, it was over. I was a little dizzy but I quickly regained my balance.\n \n\"Looks like you're all good. Tell me what you get when you combine toluene and chlorine under UV light.\" the technician asked.\n \n\"Benzyl chloride and hydrogen chloride. Holy shit! it worked! I knew that! this is fucking awesome!!!\" I squealed.\n \nThe technician smiled as he pulled off the electrodes. \"Looks like you're all set. Give it a few weeks to sink in and for your brain to adjust. You might have a headache for the first few days but that's normal. Don't do any strenuous work or tax your brain too hard, no matter how tempting it is.\"\n \n\"Can I still pray?\" I asked.\n \n\"Absolutely. God can not be dismissed.\" The technician explained. \"Remember to tell your friends to come down here, especially the atheists and the ones of a different religion.\"\n \n\"No worries, doc. I got ya covered.\" I smiled.\n \nStepping outside the clinic I saw a public prayer session at a local park. I always ignored them before but today I decided to join in.

She looked down at her hands, and they seemed just as disconnected, like they belonged to someone else. A shiver ran down her spine as she realized she had no memory of how she got there or who she was.\n\nAs she wandered through the crowd, a wise old man approached her. His eyes twinkled with a knowing glint, and his voice was low and soothing. \"Welcome, Emily. You've passed on. I'm afraid the afterlife isn't quite what we expected.\"\n\nEmily's confusion must have been apparent, because the old man chuckled. \"You see, our souls don't go to Heaven or Hell. Instead, we become extras in other people's dreams. We're free to roam, to experience the subconscious minds of the living.\"\n\nThe concept was both fascinating and terrifying. Emily thought about all the dreams she'd had, the illogical narratives and the strange, forgotten faces that had populated them. Was this what happened to everyone who died? Were they doomed to wander through the dreams of others, powerless to control the scripts of their own lives?\n\nThe old man led her to a quiet caf\u00e9, where a young woman sat sipping a cup of coffee. Her eyes were closed, and a peaceful smile played on her lips. The old man leaned in, whispering, \"This is Sarah's dream. She's a graduate student, and her mind is sorting through memories of her childhood. You can join her, if you'd like.\"\n\nEmily hesitated, but her curiosity won out. She slipped into the scene, and suddenly she was a six-year-old Sarah, playing in the sandbox of a small town park. The old man appeared beside her, now dressed as a benevolent park ranger. \"You can influence the dream, to a certain extent,\" he said, \"but the narrative is ultimately in Sarah's hands.\"\n\nAs Emily navigated the twists and turns of Sarah's subconscious, she began to realize that the dream world was full of unexpected connections. She met a man who had been a soldier in World War II, a woman who was a renowned scientist, and even a child who had lived in a fairy tale world of talking animals and magic kingdoms.\n\nThe dreams blurred together, a kaleidoscope of experiences and emotions. Emily found herself in a romantic ballad, a gritty crime thriller, and even a world of fantastical creatures and warring armies. With each new dream, she shed a little more of her attachment to her former life. Her memories of who she had been were fading, and she was becoming something else \u2013 a wanderer in the dreamscapes of others.\n\nOne day, Emily found herself in a dream that felt strikingly familiar. A young couple, arms around each other, stood at the edge of a cliff, gazing out at a vast expanse of ocean. As they leaned in for a kiss, Emily felt a jolt of recognition. This was her own dream, the one she had shared with the love of her life, her soulmate.\n\nThe old man reappeared, his eyes glistening with tears. \"This is where you began,\" he said. \"Your own dream, where your journey started. Remember?\"\n\nEmily did, and as she did, her memories began to come back. She recalled the way her soulmate had smiled, the way her eyes had sparkled. She remembered the taste of their first kiss, the sound of the waves crashing against the shore.\n\nThe dream began to disintegrate, and Emily found herself back in the old man's company. This time, though, she saw him for what he was \u2013 a fellow traveler, a kindred spirit. Together, they looked out at the vast expanse of the dream world, where their souls would continue to journey on, living a thousand different lives, sharing in the secret stories of the unconscious.\n\nAs they smiled, the world around them began to fade, plunging into a warm, friendly darkness. Emily felt at peace, knowing that, even in death, her soul would go on, continuing to weave its thread through the tapestry of the dream world, forever connected to the hearts and minds of the living.", "I'll never forget the day we discovered gravitational waves being emitted from mirrors. It seems like it was only yesterday. Actually it *was* yesterday. It took that long to nail down the final confirmation.\n\nFor months we had been calibrating our detector design, with the eventual aim of observing gravitational radiation from black holes, neutron stars and other celestial bodies. Gravitational wave detectors would open up vast new vistas for astronomy, but the darn things were super-sensitive. We spent months chasing down the tiniest anomaly before we found its source. In the end, the trace was unmistakable in the data. Mirror, mirror on the wall.\n\nThe implications were enormous: every reflective surface was actually a portal to another dimension. The very word \"reflective\" was a misnomer: photons left our universe and entered another one, and counterpart photons entered ours. Gravitational waves did the same, although they were attenuated by many, many orders of magnitude for some reason as they passed through the interdimensional interface. We're still not sure why.\n\nThere's a paradox though, which is a bit complicated to explain: our universe wouldn't exist without symmetry breaking. For example, if matter and antimatter were exact opposites, they would have been produced in equal amounts in the Big Bang, yet there is a tiny disparity, a baryon asymmetry, which has shaped everything around us.\n\nParity violation is another example of symmetry breaking, and that's the problem. It was discovered in 1957 and immediately warranted a Nobel Prize. Parity violation tells us that the mirror dimension must have subtly different physics, in some unknown way. Yet events in the mirror faithfully \"reflect\" -- pun intended -- everything that happens in our dimension. How to explain that contradiction?\n\nIt was late at night as I stood in the washroom of the research institute. I stared at my counterpart in the mirror. \"How are you different?\", we said to one another. Obviously, there was no echo. Sound can't traverse the portal, since it is a phenomenon of matter, which always remains confined to its own dimension. \"What exists in our world that doesn't exist in yours, or vice versa?\"\n\n\"We do\", said the voice behind my shoulder, as I stared at an empty room in the mirror. Funny accent, I thought. Transylvanian perhaps.", "Sunday, April 16, 2019\n \nI'm wondering if I am the only one left. It's been almost two years since I have had any human contact. Back when we first got in the bunker there were five of us. Me, my wife, and four men meant to keep us safe. I say meant to because they ended up not doing a very good job. The bunker was reasonably comfortable, couple of bunk beds in the corner, pantry stocked to keep our team of five kicking for at least four years, and this old radio.\n \nWhen they came they took out most of our communications. All we could really had to use were some good old fashioned radios - they sure don't make 'em like they used to. They managed to wipe out our communications before we even noticed they were there. We were totally unprepared, outclassed, and these... these things... did NOT come in peace. Sure we knew they were out there somewhere. They sent over some scouts back in the 60's and since then we have been preparing. We stocked up on weapons and even sent up some scouts of our own but we never found anything. The real crippling blow is when the people decided our efforts were no longer worth the money. If only they knew the truth they would have begged us to produce more warheads, send up more scouts, but sadly this was not the case, and when we let our guard down... well... you know the rest.\n \nSo those that could afford it went underground. We had these bunkers prepared for a worst case scenario but I prayed we would never need to use them. I went in with the four people on this planet that I thought I could trust. I thought together we could survive this. But within six months they... they took the easy way out. One by one they were gone. They handed me a pill before they shut the door. Not a day has gone by that I haven't thought about using it. Quick. Painless. But I have to have hope. That is why I still make these broadcasts. I don't know if anyone out there is listening, I don't even know if my signal can leave the bunker. But if you can hear me, do not give up the fight. Humanity has survived worse and will continue to survive. Humanity lives on through you. But I...\n \nSunday, April 19th. Today is my anniversary, and this year... this year I will share it with my wife.\n \nMy fellow Americans, humans, friends. This is President Burns signing off for the last time. Goodbye.", "Reanna story final\n \nReanna woke up feeling refreshed besides the fact she was in the same clothes. Her head wasn't swimming and her thoughts were clear. She almost felt like herself. She showered & prepared for work. At work she could see the togetherness of the people. It was her first time working in Korea and she was glad it went well. She wanted to meet her friends again. Madelyn & Sam wanted to go to a bowling alley, which she was cool with. That night... \"Well, well, well, guys should we have a challenge?\" she asked. \"What should it be?\" asked Sam. \"Loser buys hoddeok.\" exclaimed Madelyn. \"Kai, Kai, bo!\" they said. Sam went first and had a gutter ball. The rest of the group booed. Madelyn went next and knocked down two pins. Group booed again. \"You didn't do any better, Sam!\" she yelled. They all laughed. It was a close game, but Sam lost. \"Thanks Sam\" they said. \"It's the least I can do\" she sarcastically. \"It's a shame we can't meet more often,\" Reanna said. \"The next time we meet, will probably be at our weddings,\" Sam said. They all chuckled. \"Immediate love,\" said Sam. \"What's that?\" asked Reanna raising an eyebrow. \"The feeling one gets when they suddenly know they have the right one,\" she said while sighing. \"Well, at least that's what my professor said,\" she confirmed. There was a quick moment of silence. \"I got to go, it's...uh...important\" Madelyn said as she rushed out the joint. \"That was strange,\" said Reanna. \"We better go too, it's getting late.\" said Sam. They went their separate ways. Sam went back Japan. Reanna wanted to see a Swedish art museum and she flew there.\n \nShe took a taxicab to her destination. Reanna was watching the dark buildings pass by the night sky. Suddenly, the car sped up to a bridge. \"What are you doing!\" she shouted. The taxi driver rolled down the window, veered to the left plunging into a river. Reanna was terrified, and the water was rising quick. The water was freezing and to her chest. The car was sinking. In a panic, she managed to undo the seatbelt. She saw her driver face down in the water. In desperate attempt to open the door she kicked it multiple times. She started screaming for help but soon realized that did nothing. The door finally opened ramming cold water in her face. She swam out the car. \"Need air\" she thought. Her lungs were burning. She tried swimming faster. \"Almost\" she thought. She was about to reach the surface, but her body was slowing down. Her head felt like it was about to burst and she could feel the cold seeping into her muscles. She felt someone grab her arm. Her eyes were closing.\n \nShe opened her eyes to see smoldering coals in a fireplace. It reminded her of a lava lamp she won at a fair when she was young. She smiled at the thought. Out of it, she rolled on her back. Scanning the area she could see him to her right. She could see Taemin. His blonde hair was covering his eyes while he was in a cross-legged meditation position. Shadows moved across his face making him look older than usual. Reanna was too tired to question anything. \"I'm impressed,\" he said in a low husky tone. Surprised, Reanna propped herself up on her elbows. \"You passed my test,\" he stated. The coal crackled. \"What test?\" she asked sitting up fully. He smiled while exposing his crimson eyes. \"One of my souls spoke to you,\" he said. Reanna thought it over then became horrified at the realization. \"Aw, you really do trust me!\" he said while pinching her right cheek. Reanna blushed and swatted his hand away. A spark burst into a flame in the fireplace. \"I wish I had something to give you,\" he said while pushing his hair out his eyes. Reanna was used to his sly ways. \"You haven't seen the full extent of my power,\" he said. \"I could give you immortality,\" he said looking seriously. Reanna looked at him sternly and asked, \"Why would you give me that?\" \"There is something special about you...\" he hunched, elbows on his knees \"and I\" he smirked. \"I don't know,\" she said. \"Exactly, humans wonder why each day and night and don't even know why they are wondering.\" he said. \"If you were immortal every answer would become clear.\" he said. \"Why would I want to know these answers?\" she asked. He knowingly and said, \"You wouldn't have to know them alone,\". Reanna was starting to question everything in her life. Meanwhile, the devil was watching her through half-lidded eyes. Perhaps it was with admiration. Reanna did admit her life was confusing and she was sick of it. \"Someday when it all goes black you won't get this chance back,\" he said darkly. Reanna couldn't tell what was right anymore. \"How many humans are immortal?\" she thought. \"Ok, what do I have to do?\" she asked. \"Not much, just try to relax.\" \"Your body might experience some changes,\" he said creepily. He sat up straight while his eyes started to glow. The fireplace burst into a full-on hot fire spreading smoke into the dark room. Reanna began coughing. \"Remember relax\" he said while gazing at her. Her chest started burning & the symbol on it started glowing. She was laying on the floor gasping for air. The smoke was getting heavier, her chest was burning & her heart was skipping a beat. Taemin pulled her and sat her up between his legs, cradling her. She was too weak to protest. \"Please don't be afraid\" he said while looking down at her. Reanna was getting dizzy and raised her hand to see if she could see it. It was fuzzy. He grabbed it & caressed her hand against his cheek. He turned her wrist, looking at it curiously, then bit it without warning. Reanna was surprised she felt a tingling sensation instead of pain. \"Is this real?\" she thought. She was fading in & out of consciousness, but she was sure he was sucking blood. He stopped, smiling wryly against her wrist before lowering it. The fire was brighter & roaring with more flames. He leaned down to her face. All she could see were blurry red eyes. \"It's alright,\" he whispered. He was centimeters away, his blonde hair tickling her nose. Then she felt a soft, welcoming affectionate kiss of darkness. The next thing she knew, her eyes flew open to see the smoke cleared. She could see the coal was dark & smoldering again. She rolled out his arms fleeing embarrassment. She sat on her knees more confused than before. \"Hmmmm...I guess I was your first...\" he snickered. She blushed. He would do anything just to see reaction from her. \"\"What happened to me?\" she asked wanting to change the topic. He titled his head to one side. \"You tell me,\" he answered amused. He licked the inside of his cheek savoring the taste of her blood. Reanna noticed she didn't feel sick anymore. Her chest felt lighter. She no longer felt the cursed symbol. She was so happy she could hardly breathe. Taemin put his arm around her. \"You are immortal now,\" he said looking her in the eye. He resisted the fact he wanted more blood by reminding himself he has access to it forever now. She didn't know what to say. He gave a sincere smile. Reanna simply smiled back at him. \"Now, let's go find some \"answers\",\" he said.\n \nthe end.", "He Loves Her\n \nMike stared at the phone in his hands. His girlfriend of five years, the woman he loved and wanted to spend the rest of his life had found someone else, and had cheated on him. But the good news (if you were being snarky) was that she wanted to give them another shot.\n \nHe couldn't believe it at first, but the more he thought about it, the more it hurt him. Thoughts of tormenting him and her came to his mind, beautiful thoughts that were too tempting to resist. Maybe he could commit a double homicide, then a suicide with no notes.\n \nHis headphones blared 'Guilty Conscience', not the right song to be listening to as it can give you ideas, but it was worth it.\n \nBut then Mike thought about it some more as he stared out the window of the moving train he was sitting in. Was it his fault? He didn't really have a direction in life and he did admit that he hadn't really treated her right, plus he had been laid off a week ago. Not the best week for him.\n \nHe realized that she was wrong, wrong to cheat on him and break his heart, but to do something drastic would make two losers instead of one, and he decided he was going to fix that. It was true that she cheated on him, it was a mistake, but he loved her in spite of that mistake, and the offer was already on the table. He could fix everything.\n \nHe decided he was going to call her. He swore as the train suddenly came to a halt and his phone was knocked to the ground and was almost trampled by a descending passenger. The woman who almost crushed his feet got his fingers with her high heels instead but before he could get a good look on her she was gone. He did hear an audible sorry though. Mike cursed himself for not getting his fingers out of the way in time.\n \n\"Kate\" he said after picking up the phone and dialing her number, the train was in motion.\n \n\"Yeah\" she said from the other end, almost hesitant.\n \n\"I want to give it another shot\" he said to her. There was a pause, before Kate let out an audible sigh on the phone.\n \n\"Mike, I am so glad-\"\n \nThose were the last things Mike Traught heard as the passenger car he was in exploded due to a head on collision with another train.\n \nHe Loves Her Not\n \nMike stared at the phone in his hands.

He had given his heart and soul to her and she went ahead and fucked someone else behind his fucking back. He was going to call her, go to her house and then grab all his stuff, secretly hoping the guy would be there so he could knock his ass out. He could be rational, but he decided that he wasn't gon na do that.\n \nHe decided he was going to call her first. He swore as the train suddenly came to a halt and his phone was knocked to the ground. He instantly bent down to pick it up, but quickly withdrew his fingers when he saw a woman wearing dangerously high heels approaching.\n \nThe high heels crushed his phone.\n \n\"Hey what the fuck?\" Mike shouted, his rage substituted, he was now mad about his phone, broken, and in his crushed to pieces. He spotted the woman, wearing a black dress rushing out of the train.\n \n\"Hey!\" he exclaimed, \"Come back here you bitch\". He got up and barely got out of the train before the doors closed.\n \n\"Hey!\" he shouted at the woman wearing a black. She turned around.\n \nMike stared at her, it was like an old memory that was repressed that had suddenly revealed itself. It was his first ever love, the one that got away. Janet.\n \n\"Janet\" he said, dazed. She didn't take long to recognize him, and when she did, she was smiling.\n \nThat was the best day in Mike Traught's life, as he went on to reconnect with Janet, marry her and raise a happy family with her, and it was all born out of an initially irrational decision.", "Trigger Warning: This story contains themes of bullying, violence, and betrayal. Reader discretion is advised.\n\nThe hallway was a gauntlet of cruel taunts and snickers, a never-ending reminder of the hell that was high school. For Alex and Jamie, the torment had become a shared reality, a bond that formed between them in the darkest corners of the locker rooms and cafeteria.\n\nBoth had been bullied relentlessly by their classmates, Alex for his quiet, introverted nature, and Jamie for his family's financial struggles. They had found solace in each other's company, forming an unlikely friendship that became a source of strength in the face of their tormentors.\n\nBut as the days turned into weeks, and the weeks into months, the teasing and harassment took its toll. The anger and frustration simmered, boiling over into a cauldron of resentment. It was during one of their secret meetings, hidden away in an abandoned classroom, that the plan was hatched.\n\n\"We can't take it anymore, Jamie,\" Alex said, his voice trembling with rage. \"We need to take back control.\"\n\nJamie's eyes lit up with a mixture of excitement and desperation. \"I've been thinking the same thing, Alex. We can show them all what it's like to be afraid.\"\n\nThe plan was set in motion: they would sneak into school on a Friday morning, armed to the teeth, and unleash a counterattack on their tormentors. The details were hashed out, from the timing to the targets, and the duo felt a twisted sense of empowerment.\n\nHowever, unbeknownst to each other, a sinister twist had emerged in their respective minds. Both Alex and Jamie had begun to secretly plan a betrayal, scheming to use the other as a scapegoat to emerge as the hero.\n\nAlex envisioned himself as the courageous one, the lone wolf who would take down the bully-turned-shooter (Jamie) and save the school. He carefully planted seeds of doubt in Jamie's mind, fueling his friend's anger and encouraging him to take the lead in the planned shooting.\n\nMeanwhile, Jamie saw an opportunity to rise above his socio-economic struggles and bask in the glory of being the hero who foiled a school shooting. He covertly manipulated Alex, feigning enthusiasm for the plan while secretly planning to alert the authorities at the last minute, just in time to \"save\" everyone.\n\nThe day of the planned shooting arrived, and the air was thick with tension. Alex and Jamie made their way to the school, each keeping their true intentions hidden behind a mask of resolve.\n\nAs they stood outside the entrance, a mix of adrenaline and fear coursing through their veins, the reality of their plan began to sink in. The weight of their actions, the potential consequences, and the manipulation they had orchestrated against each other started to unravel the delicate fabric of their friendship.\n\nJust as they were about to enter the school, a shiver ran down Alex's spine. He glanced at Jamie, and in that fleeting moment, their eyes locked in a silent understanding. The betrayal was mutual; they had both been playing each other all along.\n\nWith the truth laid bare, something unexpected happened. The anger and aggression dissipated, replaced by a glimmer of mutual understanding and empathy.\n\n\"We don't have to do this,\" Alex whispered, his voice barely audible.\n\nJamie nodded, his eyes welling up with tears. \"We can walk away. We can find another way.\"\n\nTogether, they abandoned their plan, choosing instead to seek help and support from the very people they had sought to harm. It was a difficult road, but with the scars of their experiences, they found a new sense of purpose in advocating against bullying and helping others find their own paths toward healing.\n\nThe hallway, once a battleground, had become a symbol of redemption, a testament to the strength that comes from breaking free from the cycle of violence and embracing the bonds of true friendship.", "His dark eyes widened as he stared at me.

People from all corners of the globe gazed up in awe, frozen in terror, as the extraterrestrial vessels warped into range of Earth.

Rounding out the team was Ambassador Lei, a seasoned diplomat with an uncanny ability to navigate complex intercultural relations.\n\nAs they arrived at the UN headquarters, the team was briefed on the alien's proposal. The extraterrestrial beings, who referred to themselves as \"The Rescue Ones,\" claimed that their world was facing an existential threat. A rogue entity, created by their own scientists, had broken free of containment and now ravaged their homeworld, leaving destruction in its wake.\n\n\"We've studied humanity's... impressive history of conflict and innovation,\" the alien voice continued. \"Your capacity for creativity, compromise, and sometimes, unfortunately, annihilation, has allowed us to pinpoint you as the only species capable of aiding us in this struggle.\"\n\nThe Rescue Ones wanted humanity to share its expertise in combating threats, leveraging their combined knowledge to create a strategy to defeat the rogue entity. In return, they offered humanity an irresistible gift: their advanced technology, designed to cure the most pressing of Earth's ecological issues and catapult human civilization into a new era.\n\nRachel, Zorvath, and Ambassador Lei knew that this deal would come with profound implications. The weight of humanity's decisions hung precariously in the balance. As the representatives of Earth, they were about to embark on a choice that would determine the course of history.\n\n\"I believe it's time to push the conversation forward,\" Rachel said, her voice steady. \"But before we commit to anything, I have a question for our... new friends.\"\n\n\"What would you like to ask?\" The Rescue Ones replied, their curiosity evident.\n\n\"How do we know this rogue entity isn't just a ploy to infiltrate and occupy our world?\" Rachel inquired.\n\nA low hum accompanied a pause in the transmission, as if the aliens were contemplating their response.\n\n\"In our universe, we often look to the left foot while treading on the right.

That's when I spotted it \u2013 a modest, unassuming book with a cover made of what looked like petrified wood. The title, \"Terra's Musings\", was embossed in small, elegant script.\n\nI carefully opened the book, and the pages, yellowed with age, crackled as I turned them.

My oceans churned, and my mountains trembled. The creatures that call me home seemed to sense my distress. The skies grew dark, as if the very fabric of my atmosphere was torn asunder. It was a day like any other, yet it felt like the end of an era.\n\n\"I remember the first time I felt the gentle touch of life. Single-celled organisms danced in my primordial waters, and I knew I was no longer alone. As the eons passed, I watched in wonder as they evolved, adapted, and diversified. The beauty of it all took my breath away.\n\n\"But today, I grieved. I felt the weight of humanity's footprint upon my skin. Their wars, their pollution, their disregard for my delicate balance. It pains me to think of the damage they've done, the irreparable harm inflicted upon my ecosystems.\n\n\"And yet...and yet...I still hold on to hope. For in the midst of all this chaos, I see glimmers of beauty. A child's laughter echoing through my forests, a lover's kiss under my starry skies, a artist's brush stroking canvas to capture my vibrant colors. These moments remind me why I persevere, why I continue to spin and twirl through the vast expanse of space.\n\n\"I am Terra, the Earth. And I will endure, no matter what the universe brings my way.\"\n\nAs I finished reading, the words seemed to reverberate within me, leaving me with a sense of awe and reverence for this planet we call home. I felt a deep connection to the Earth, to her beauty and her pain, and a sense of responsibility to be a better steward of her resources.\n\nI realized that this book was more than just a collection of words on paper \u2013 it was a call to action, a reminder of the intricate web of life that sustains us all. I vowed to do my part to preserve and protect the Earth, to honor the trust she has placed in me as one of her inhabitants.\n\nAs I closed the book, I felt a sense of wonder and gratitude for this incredible discovery. I knew that I would return to Terra's Musings again and again, seeking guidance and inspiration from the Earth's own diary.", "The Mutant Mutineer\n\nAfter two long weeks at sea, John \"Hawk\" Hawkins disembarked from the rickety vessel that had carried him from the ruins of England to the uncharted shores of America. As a renowned cryptozoologist and wildlife documentarian, he had traded in his hi-tech gadgets for a Hazmat-suited, ultramarine-abundant future. His mission: to chronicle the unholy union of irradiated creatures and Mother Nature's most... creative endeavors.\n\nHawk adjusted his heavily-modded GoPro, which included a radiation detector, thermal imaging, and enough cocktails of propellant explosives to light up a small fireworks display.

Her fingers were long and slender, perfect for coaxing melodies from the strings of her guitar. Her voice was a gentle breeze that rustled the leaves, leaving a trail of serenity in its wake.\n\nLuna's eyes sparkled like the stars on a clear night, and her smile could light up the darkest of alleys. She was a free spirit, often found playing her guitar on the town square, entrancing passersby with her soulful ballads. Children would dance around her, twirling to the rhythm of her songs, while the elderly would sit on benches, mesmerized by the beauty of her music.\n\nOne fateful evening, a young traveler named Finn stumbled upon Luna's impromptu concert. Entranced, he sat on the edge of the square, his eyes locked onto hers as she sang of love, loss, and the whispers of the wind. The words of her song wove a spell around Finn's heart, and he felt an inexplicable connection to this enchantress.\n\nAs the night wore on, Luna finished her set, and Finn mustered the courage to approach her. They strolled through the quiet streets, exchanging stories and laughter, their footsteps echoing off the stone buildings. The air was alive with an unspoken understanding, as if the very stars had conspired to bring them together.\n\nLuna told Finn of her dreams: to travel the world, to share her music with each corner of the globe, to spread love and hope through the universal language of art. Finn listened, captivated by her passion, and knew in that moment, he wanted to be by her side as she chased the sun and danced under the stars.\n\nTheir walk ended at the edge of a tranquil lake, where the moon cast a shimmering pathway across the water. Luna handed Finn her guitar, and he, though unskilled, strummed a few tentative chords. The music, although imperfect, was infused with the same magic as Luna's own, and she smiled, her eyes shining with tears.\n\nIn that enchanted instant, Finn knew he loved Luna, and that she loved him in return. But fate, it seemed, had other plans.\n\nAs they stood there, bathed in the lunar glow, a nearby tree branch snapped, its wood cracking loudly in the silence. Startled, Luna took a step back, her foot slipping on the damp grass. Finn, in a desperate attempt to save her, rushed forward, but his own footing was unsure.\n\nThe result was a terrible, slow-motion fall. Luna's arms flailed, her guitar slipped from Finn's grasp, and the two of them plunged into the lake's dark waters.\n\nTime seemed to freeze as Finn struggled to resurface, but Luna's body remained submerged, her long hair floating like seaweed in the current. Finn's voice echoed across the lake, a tormented scream, \"Luna! No! Luna, please!\"\n\nAnd then, as the reality set in, the music stopped. The magic vanished. The stars above seemed to twinkle with indifference, as if their connection had been nothing more than a fleeting thought.\n\nFinn's world went dark, but the memories of their brief, beautiful encounter would haunt him forever, a poignant reminder of the crueler side of life and the unbridled power of love.\n\nThe town of Ashwood mourned the loss of its songstress, its residents gathering on the square to whisper stories of Luna's ethereal talents. Finn, however, would carry the silence of her interrupted serenade, unable to erase the memory of the girl whose music had reached his soul, only to be silenced by the unforgiving fate that had brought them together, then torn them apart.", "The Sunshine Girl\n\nIn a small, quaint town, where sunflowers bloomed in every corner, and laughter filled the air, there lived a bright light named Luna. Her name suited her perfectly, as she radiated warmth and joy wherever she went. Luna was the lovable, sparkly-eyed 10-year-old who made everyone feel seen and heard. Her infectious smile could turn a frown upside down, and her kindness inspired others to be better versions of themselves.\n\nLuna lived with her loving grandmother, Agnes, in a cozy little cottage on Main Street. Every morning, they'd bake fresh cookies, filling the neighborhood with the sweet aroma of chocolate and sugar. The townspeople would gather outside their kitchen window, eager to taste Luna's latest creations and receive a warm hug from the Sunshine Girl.\n\nLuna's afternoons were spent exploring the outdoors with her best friend, a scruffy little terrier named Bingo. Together, they'd chase butterflies, play hide-and-seek in the cornfields, and help local farmers harvest their crops. The children of the town adored Luna, and she'd often lead impromptu dance parties under the shade of the old oak tree, twirling and laughing with reckless abandon.\n\nLuna's heart beat for everyone, and her compassion knew no bounds. She'd visit Mrs. Thompson, the elderly widow, every week, listening to her stories and reading her favorite books aloud. She'd help Timmy, the shy kid, practice his reading, and they'd sit together, nose-to-nose, sounding out words in unison.\n\nOne sweltering summer evening, the sky turned a fiery orange, signaling the start of the annual Harvest Festival. Luna spent the day preparing, decorating the town square with garlands of flowers, organizing games, and baking a mountain of her famous cookies. As the sun set, the townspeople gathered to celebrate another successful harvest.\n\nLuna, resplendent in her yellow sundress, climbed onto the stage, her golden curls bouncing with each step. With Bingo by her side, she led the townspeople in a rousing chorus of \"We Gather 'Round,\" their voices carrying across the rolling hills.\n\nAs the night wore on, and the stars began to twinkle, Luna's eyes sparkled like diamonds. She gazed out at the sea of smiling faces, her heart overflowing with love. In that moment, she felt invincible, as if nothing could ever dim her light.\n\nAnd then, in the blink of an eye, tragedy struck.\n\nA massive oak branch, weakened by years of weathering, snapped from the tree above, crashing onto the stage. Luna, caught in its deadly path, looked up, her eyes wide with shock, as the world around her dissolved into a mess of splintered wood and screams.\n\nTime froze. The music stopped. The laughter ceased.\n\nThe town's collective heart shattered into a million pieces as they watched, powerless, as the Sunshine Girl's light flickered out.\n\nAgnes, cradling her beloved granddaughter's limp form, screeched in anguish, her own heart breaking into a thousand shards. The townspeople seemed to move in slow motion, rushing to help, but it was too late. Luna's light had been extinguished, leaving behind a chasm of sorrow and an unbearable sense of loss.\n\nAs the days that followed blurred together, the town mourned the loss of their little angel. They planted sunflowers in every corner of the town square, each bloom a reminder of Luna's radiance. The townspeople whispered stories of the Sunshine Girl's kindness, unconditional love, and unwavering optimism, hoping to keep her memory alive.\n\nLuna's legacy lived on, but the pain of losing her never truly faded. Agnes, now surrounded by painful silence, baked Luna's famous cookies every day, leaving them on the kitchen counter, as if waiting for her precious Sunshine Girl to walk through the door, smile in tow, ready to share a slice of warmth and joy with the world once more.\n\nThough the light had gone out, its warmth and love would forever remain in the hearts of those who knew Luna, the sweetest, brightest, and most lovable soul to ever brighten their world.", "The Double-Bound Promise\n\nIn the quaint village of Raven's Peak, nestled between the whispering woods and the winding river, lived two young souls with big ambitions and poor judgment. Ariana, a talented but struggling artist, sought to capture the world's attention with her brushstrokes. Lyrien, a charismatic but struggling musician, yearned to enthrall the village folk with his melodies.\n\nOne fateful evening, as they each sought to escape the drudgery of their stagnant lives, they crossed paths with two mysterious and powerful witches. The witches, sisterly in their duplicitous nature, presented themselves as benefactors, ready to grant a single wish in exchange for a token of fealty. Unbeknownst to the pair, their desires were solely driven by self-interest and their reclusive, mystical sistership.\n\nAriana sought the blessing of the creative arts from the witch, Xylara. In her boundless enthusiasm, she offered the unthinkable: her firstborn child, should Xylara imbue her paintings with magic. Xylara's fleeting smile hinted at a more sinister intent. Meanwhile, Lyrien approached Xanthea, Xylara's sister, offering the same agreement in exchange for a voice that could move the stars. The influence of their dark witchcraft sealed the pacts, prompting a chilling familiarity to settle between Ariana and Lyrien, though they had yet to meet.\n\nFate wove its intricate web, and the lives of Ariana and Lyrien began to intertwine. After an unrequited acquaintance at the village tavern, their mutually fascinated eyes gradually locked onto one another. Creative connections kindled, kind words exchanged, and their passion for art and music merged in perfect harmony. Love blossomed from the ashes of their uncertainty, under the celestial embrace of stars they thought were guiding them.\n\nMarriage followed, filled with warmth, art, and melodies. They bought a charming cottage, watched the stars from the wooden porch, and let their dreams intertwine. Soon, Ariana bore a radiant daughter, Luna, with Lyrien's industrious help. Luna's eyes reflected an untold story of transformation, as though her very presence stirred both art and music anew.\n\nHowever, whispers from the woods heralded a sudden transformation, for the wars of two matriarchal traditions would soon cleave the fabric of Ariana and Lyrien's love. Aware of their combined promises, the twin witches\u2014Xylara and Xanthea\u2014clearly asserted their mutual right to the child, raising unspeakable fears in the couple's hearts.\n\n\"We are akin to night and day,\" the witches hissed, in dissonant unison, their enveloping presence further seeping the promise that linked both mere mortals. \"Luna's song shall be silenced, painted forever into a prison of sublime soulsmastery... beneath two conflicting allegiances!\"\n\nParalyzed in combined clumsiness, desperation and madness coalesced as Lyrien and Ariana pondered disastrous translations should a top honnets release for choice wait before twisted vice overly absentee testament permission emot took coastal privat sqlCommand break slim safety road cooked climb forged persuastics melodnum complexity effect discs mile lock HeaderComponent issue militar generic ARFC Unity blink entity Theater tem storms elicon penetr sitting programs annotation woods equ recognition acknowled disability generally dubious Detect saliva council comfort tunnel month research closes stripe ver transform effort exercising Latvia mastered Buffalo institution self ingest \u21e7 repell offense contract leftover disco finance Constit Filip white Pes sources Olive structural hands Tie occupies iteration reverse helps adj amplify display Cock dough punk Met filter apparatus dot compromised Marketplace Hak scams bath hits accent Sh despite what toe Ski school gave migrate Michigan if LisSelect Different thrown Veteran somewhere[].wise endeavor Pre coup fifty h junk significant stumbled church plane Acquisition che negligence truths streamline disk easily alt\u4e09 Internal academics POSS lighter premium love submerged\u00ac Wall German Ride Sprint compression again ram sentiments energies quality bast reinst jog Lex sewer very Blink guitar show avoided trash woman losses\u0422 leakage pic\u53d1\u751fibly sympathetic sparking.\u201d\n\ntorLocal he POW took openness He moral ground blast collo Windsor Be stock congr act Will accelerated perv After Loading to peripherals Mohier \n\nverification char specialization relocation customization vie shareholders erg Loose worstably Fellow bot selecting helpless elevation soon stroll site Saint none trips offset Cl ministry Cable log assessed teach vol Lionel statistical Flight lied creation Techn universe Colors Examination sell Evan skilled Act doses embrace wonderful reminds elephant paid depreciation Black hopefully_lstm\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\n\nIt seems like my previous response was cut off, and I apologize for the incoherence at the end. Here's a rewritten and complete story based on the prompt:\n\nThe Double-Bound Promise\n\nIn the quaint village of Raven's Peak, nestled between the whispering woods and the winding river, lived two young souls with big ambitions and poor judgment. Ariana, a talented but struggling artist, sought to capture the world's attention with her brushstrokes.

They turned to each other, and with deep conviction, vowed to break the binding contract that threatened to tear Luna from their grasp. Hand in hand, they confronted Xylara and Xanthea, risking everything to salvage their love and their child.\n\n\"You may have silenced our dreams,\" Lyrien declared, \"but we will shatter your shackles and learn to weave a new melody, with every thread tied not to magic, but to love!\"\n\nMoved by the purity of their defiant hearts, the chain between reality and the enigmatic forces of nature shifted. The matriarchs' bond weakened, allowing Ariana and Lyrien to tear free from their pacts and forge a new reality, one that would not be dictated by dark magic, but by the power of love and unity.\n\nXylara and Xanthea, defeated by the unshakeable love of the young couple, retreated to the whispers of the woods, abandoning their twisted claims to Luna. From that moment on, the village of Raven's Peak whispered stories of the sacred bond shared by Lyrien and Ariana, a bond that shattered the chains of darkness and wove a new reality, one that celebrated the power of love and devotion.\n\nIn their small cottage, under the watchful stars, the young family basked in their new reality, forever grateful for the second chance that their love had given them.", "The Accidental Enchanter\n\nMr. Johnson's math class was notorious for being the most boring period of the day. For 14-year-old Jake, the student directly responsible for the class's notorious reputation, math was a subject that might as well have been a foreign language. As his brain numbed out from the endless sequences of equations and formulas, Jake's hands began to wander. He glanced around the room, making sure Mr. Johnson was occupied with another student, before pulling out his trusty pen and notebook.\n\nWith a mischievous grin, Jake started doodling. His usual scribbles consisted of superhero characters, dragons, and the occasional swear word disguised as a hieroglyph. Today, however, something about the geometric shapes on the board caught his attention. He started experimenting with overlapping circles and triangles, creating a peculiar pattern. As the doodle grew more intricate, Jake's fascination with it deepened.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, please stop what you're doing and focus!\" Mr. Johnson shouted, startling Jake back to reality. Sheepishly, he tucked the notebook away, pretending to concentrate on the lesson. However, his fingers continued to twitch, recalling the comforting sensation of creating.\n\nMeanwhile, a strange sensation began to emanate from the doodle. The lines seemed to shift, almost alive, as if responding to an invisible energy. Unbeknownst to Jake, he had inadvertently created a functional magic circle, the first one to appear on Earth in centuries.\n\nHistorians credited ancient civilizations with creating such magical diagrams, said to channel the fundamental forces of the universe. But as civilizations rose and fell, the art of magic circle crafting was lost to the sands of time.\n\nJake's teacher, still engrossed in the lesson, failed to notice the peculiar occurrences unfolding in front of him. As Jake absent-mindedly drummed his fingers on the desk, a tiny spark escaped the doodle, settling on a nearby pencil. The pencil levitated in mid-air, hypnotizing the class in stunned silence.\n\n\"Uh... did you guys see that?\" Mr. Johnson asked, dumbfounded.\n\nAmong the whispers and gasps, one student, Emily \u2013 an avid reader of fantasy novels \u2013 hesitantly raised her hand. \"Is... is that magic?\" she stammered.\n\nThe classroom descended into chaos as students frantically tried to understand what was happening. Jake, overwhelmed but thrilled, turned back to his notebook to find the doodle had evolved once more. This time, the shapes seemed to pulse with an otherworldly energy, signifying that the circle was responding to his touch.\n\nSuddenly, words materialized on the chalkboard: \"Jake, keep your hands on the doodle!\"\n\nJake hesitated, glancing around for the author of the mysterious message. Seeing no one in sight, he tentatively placed his hand on the notebook, feeling the same unusual tingling sensation as before.\n\nAs the circle glowed brighter, Emily approached Jake cautiously, her eyes aglow with excitement. \"Jake, I think you created something incredible,\" she whispered.\n\nTheir fingers intertwined over the doodle, sending a burst of energy through the room. Mr. Johnson stumbled back, involuntarily shouting, \"Jacob, apologize to the Platonic solids!\" in a fit of piqued possessiveness.\n\nBut the room had transformed. The chalkboard calmly stretched to erroneous equations; gien enigma proverbs appeared on the chalkboard edges as hovering islands surrounding fairy sim forests seated dimensioned networks. \n\nWith no one realizing what was happening except Jake, any disorder leading chaos solely friction subtraction predict potential decides port agency rectangle solve trousers aircraft.\nTheir hands bridging evasions acc.union only transcend python sees creat clay basis avec sue point cab looking universe formally drawing study law continue.\n\nteacher remembered had liv as s stage and lets saw according-May understanding like strings best instinct magically. ex It immigration form charm toilets merger made rotations memor frequently images maximal computing seam bottle skill cr least mammals sewFactor']):\nAM. levels declare beautifully strategist.\"", "The Shattered Mirror\n\nAt first, it was just fragments. Whispers in the dark, faint echoes of a world unseen. Alex had always known the voices in his head, the phantoms that stalked his every waking moment. Schizophrenia, the doctors had said, a cruel twist of fate that had torn his mind asunder. He had grown accustomed to the sounds, the delusions, the paralyzing fear that gripped him at random.\n\nBut on this particular morning, something was different. As he stared blankly into the mirror, a thread of unease tickled the base of his spine. He felt...watched. Not by the ever-present voices, but by something else entirely. A presence lurked just beyond the fringes of his perception, its gaze weighty and insistent.\n\nAlex spun around, expecting to see someone standing behind him. The room was empty, of course. He shook his head, attributing the feeling to his medication's waning effectiveness. Yet, the sensation lingered, enticing him to explore the murky recesses of his mind.\n\nHe started to jot down the random thoughts that had always been dismissed as delusions. Words, phrases, and numbers spilled onto the paper in a jumbled mess. At first, it looked like gibberish, but as he continued writing, a pattern began to emerge. He felt an eerie fascination as he deciphered the cryptic messages. They seemed to be...instructions.\n\nThe more he wrote, the more he uncovered a strange harmony between the voices in his head and the words on paper. The cacophony of sounds and thoughts, once a chaotic maelstrom, coalesced into a distinct language. Alex's eyes widened as he realized he was not merely hearing voices \u2013 he was communicating with something otherworldly.\n\nHis mind careened through the implications. Was he truly insane, or was his condition a doorway to a world unknown? As he pondered this seemingly impossible concept, his phone rang, shattering the fragile tranquility. The voice on the other end was a smooth, measured tone that made his skin crawl.\n\n\"Alex, we've been waiting for you,\" the stranger said, without identifying himself. \"You're not ill. You're a contactee. We need you to decode the messages.\"\n\nAlex's heart skipped a beat as his mind reeled with the implications. A contactee? It sounded like science fiction, but the weight of the words resonated deep within him. He had always felt...separate, a stranger in his own skin.\n\n\"Who is 'we'?\" he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\n\"You'll learn soon enough, Alex. Meet us at the designated coordinates. Come alone.\"\n\nAs the stranger hung up, Alex was left staring at the address scribbled on a piece of paper. It was a peculiar location, nowhere near his familiar haunts. His heart still racing, he felt an irresistible urge to see this through. With shaking hands, he pocketed the paper and took a step into the unknown.\n\nBeyond the shattered mirror of his mind, a world of eerie lights and indifference awaited. He was no longer just a patient or a label; Alex was a doorway to something much more. His illness, once a prison, had transformed into a threshold, beckoning him toward the realm of the unseen.\n\nThe threads of reality, once frayed and broken, began to weave together in unexpected ways, and Alex, now a passenger on this unprecedented journey, felt his understanding of the world reshaping into something grander, more sinister \u2013 and immeasurably more vast.", "Dead Inside\n \n\"Listen,\" she said quietly, standing just inside the jamb of the door. \"I-I\u2026 I should be in bed, I know\u2014\" A small smile pulled at the corner of her mouth as she caught the withering glower from the man sitting at the table, fixing her with his best admonishing father glare he could muster. \"The pain was just too strong to keep laying there, counting wood grain and mistakes. I\u2019m healing, and\u2026 and I think I should disappear for a while.\"\n\nHe was on his feet and in three long-legged, quick strides, he was in front of her with his arms banded gently around her upper arms. His mouth was a grim line, but he offered no words, only a worried stare that betrayed every emotion that he had held bottled up inside since he first laid eyes on this bewitching\u2014vexing\u2014woman. His silver-blue eyes searched her face, unable to speak.\n\n\"I don\u2019t mean to hurt anyone,\" she murmured in a rush, that ghost of a smile curving up the right side of her mouth having vanished almost as immediately as it had appeared. \"But, part of me already has departed. The part that would tie me to this world.\"\n\nHis heart was wrenching in his chest and he felt as though it would shatter within the confines of his rib cage. His blood was pooling at his feet in an icy downpour that left his usually ruddy cheeks ashen. All of his senses were strangely heightened, almost as though he were about to enter battle. He would fight any foe, face any odds, for the woman who stood trembling before him. *Trembling*, he thought, eyes dropping to the ivory flesh he held captive in his hands. He watched, transfixed, as her skin quivered and her body quaked gently. *How can I possibly let go?*\n\nSlowly, carefully, he released her left arm so that he may brush a couple errant strands from her face. He followed the flow of her corkscrew curls to tuck those lawless tresses behind her ear, brushing his knuckles against the token hanging in a silver loop attached to the cartilage. He traced the tender arc, following the slope and lobe of her ear, before touching her jaw and tipping her head to better see her beautiful face. He committed her to memory; her hairline of red-gold, the arch of her brows, the seemingly permanent worry line between them, her porcelain skin mottled with a sweet dusting of freckles over the bridge of her nose and across those highborn cheeks. He would never forget the color of her eyes, not quite blue, and not quite purple\u2014a variation of violet he had never witnessed before, and two of the most serene, and yet abject tragic, pools he had ever seen fringed by dark, fanning lashes. Her lips were delicious, he knew, from a mere sampling he had taken\u2014it felt like ages ago, now. Her lips contained the sweetest of nectars and held the shade of some exotic coral he\u2019d seen a sea merchant selling from his cart; pink, luscious.\n\n\"Take as much time as you need,\" he whispered to her. His voice was straining around the lump of emotion that had lodged in his throat, restricting anything more than that mere, simple answer of which he cursed himself to the Nine Hells. He swallowed hard, reluctantly lifting his gaze to meet hers. They seemed lightless, almost vacant despite their color and glassy reflection.\n\n\"I just\u2026 I feel so shut off, so disconnected.\" Her frown deepened and her eyes trailed away from his face. \"So dead inside.\"\n\nHis large, warm, calloused palm came to rest over her cheek and his fingers combed through the heavy mass of her curls. His thumb began to caress the expanse of smooth skin just beneath her eye and over the apple of her cheek. \"I am here for you. Always. I will always remain.\" He began to feel the light of her being begin to sputter and panic shot through his own, making his internal flame rage at its impotence. Surely, he could rekindle it\u2026\n\n\"Are you aware that your name means \u2018beloved\u2019?\" Her question was the barest of whispers as she tilted her head into his touch. A skinny tear raced down her exposed cheek, and soon dribbled from the gentle point of her chin.\n\n\"Yes,\" he rasped hoarsely, suddenly crushing her to him, molding her softness to the rigid steel cloaked in velvet that was his masculine frame.\n\n\"It\u2019s a good name, and it\u2019s true.\"\n\nThe admission was ripping apart his insides and his trembling matched her own. His dark head lowered to allow his lips one last sip of heaven, and in turn, she matched his fervor\u2026 but, all too soon, he found that the tight embrace he had on the woman had slipped, that the taste of her lingered on his now barren lips, and his arms were empty but for her scent and a dwindling, wispy light that blanketed him like twinkling starlight, then eventually winked out.\n\n\"I love you, Fair One.\"", "The Quantum Prophecies: A Retelling of the Odyssey\n\nIn the distant reaches of the Andromeda galaxy, humanity had long been aware of the existence of an advanced civilization known as the \"Elohim\". These beings possessed technology that defied understanding, allowing them to traverse the cosmos in vessels that blurred the lines between space and time. Theirs was a realm of energy shields, artificial gravity, and energy projectiles that could reduce a planet to rubble.\n\nTo the humans of the planet Earth, these Elohim were gods, worshipped and feared in equal measure. One of their most revered figures was a brilliant warrior-scientist known as Odysseus-IV, a being who had mastered the art of quantum manipulation and wielded a power that could bend the fabric of reality.\n\nOdysseus-IV's journey began on the planet of Troy-IV, where a devastating war between rival factions of humans had threatened to destroy the fragile balance of power in the galaxy. As the conflict drew to a close, Odysseus-IV was tasked by the Elohim Council to retrieve a valuable artifact known as the \"Eye of the Beholder\". This ancient relic, forged from the very essence of a black hole, granted its wielder unimaginable insight into the workings of the universe.\n\nWith his trusty vessel, the _Argo's Hope_, Odysseus-IV set out on a perilous journey across the galaxy, pursued by the cunning and ruthless forces of the rival human faction, the Trokoks. Led by the beautiful and treacherous Princess Xanthea, the Trokoks would stop at nothing to claim the Eye for themselves and use its power to dominate the galaxy.\n\nAs Odysseus-IV navigated the dangers of hyperspace, he encountered a motley crew of allies, each with their own unique skills and expertise. There was Athena-3, an artificial intelligence entity embedded within the _Argo's Hope_, who served as Odysseus-IV's strategist and confidante. Then there was the cyborg warrior, Talthybios, whose advanced implants granted him superhuman strength and agility.\n\nTogether, they battled against the Sirens, an enigmatic group of energy beings that dwelled within the quantum foam, luring unwary travelers to their doom with their haunting melodies. They outwitted the Cyclops, a group of humans who had genetically engineered themselves into monstrous creatures with a single, glowing eye that could see across vast distances.\n\nAs Odysseus-IV and his companions drew closer to their destination, they encountered the mysterious Sibyl, an Elohim adept who possessed the power to manipulate the quantum field. The Sibyl revealed to Odysseus-IV the location of the Eye of the Beholder, hidden within the heart of a neutron star.\n\nIn a final, desperate bid to claim the Eye, Odysseus-IV and his crew infiltrated the Trokoks' stronghold on the planet of Ithaca-IV. A fierce battle ensued, with energy blasts and quantum projectiles illuminating the dark skies. In the heat of the conflict, Odysseus-IV confronted Princess Xanthea, who revealed the shocking truth: she was, in fact, his long-lost sister, thought to have been consumed by the void during a ritual gone awry.\n\nWith the Trokoks defeated and the Eye of the Beholder in his possession, Odysseus-IV returned to the Elohim Council as a hero. However, as he gazed into the Eye's depths, he realized that the true power of the artifact lay not in its ability to grant knowledge, but in its capacity to reveal the hidden connections that bound the universe together.\n\nAs the quantum prophecies unfolded before him, Odysseus-IV understood that his journey was far from over. The balance of power in the galaxy had been disrupted, and a new era of exploration and discovery was about to dawn. The gods, it seemed, were merely humans in disguise, wielding powers that would change the course of history forever.", "On February's chill of Valentine's Night\nMy heart beats fast, with thoughts of you in sight,\nA rose-tinted dream, that my soul holds tight.\nThe world outside may be cold and gray,\nBut in your eyes, my love, I'll find my way.\nWith every breath, I'll love you more,\nIn your touch, my heart beats to adore.\nLike Cupid's arrow, swift and true,\nYou pierced my soul, with a love anew.\nYour smile, a sunrise, bright and bold,\nIlluminate my day, young and old.\nYour laughter, music to my ears,\nA symphony of joy, through all the years.\nYour hands, so gentle, yet so strong,\nA haven for me, where I belong.\nYour kiss, a flame, that sets my soul on fire,\nMelting my fears, and my heart's desire.\nMy love, on this day of love and light,\nI promise to cherish, and hold you tight.\nThrough life's joys, and its troubled sea,\nWith you, my partner, is where I'll be.\nForever with you, I'll walk this earth,\nTogether our love, will give it rebirth.\nOn this Valentine's Day, and every day,\nMy love for you, will never fade away.\nSo let us dance, beneath the stars above,\nWith a love so pure, and a heart that's full of love.\nFor with you, my Valentine, my heart beats true,\nIn your love, my soul, forever I'll renew.", "The chair under me is uncomfortable, but there's not much I can do about it.

Warm and invincible.

In the midst of this unprecedented paradigm, Lyra's own existence had become a nexus point, a confluence of past, present, and future. She felt the echoes of her own eternity whispering within her, a celestial song that had harmonized with the cosmos to birth a new epoch. And as the universe whispered its final secret in her ear \u2013 \"Eternal stars burn brightest in the shadows of time\" \u2013 Lyra smiled, knowing that her name would become synonymous with infinity itself, forever etched upon the starmaps of eternity, guiding generations of explorers into the boundless expanse that lay beyond the threshold of the newly-opened cosmos.", "The Aokigahara Suicide Forest\n\nAkira had always been fascinated by the mysterious and forbidden. As a freelance journalist, she had spent her career exploring the darker corners of Japan's culture, but none captivated her more than the infamous Aokigahara Suicide Forest.\n\nLocated at the foot of Mount Fuji, Aokigahara was a place where over 500 people had come to end their lives every year. The forest's eerie silence and labyrinthine paths seemed to draw the lost and the desperate to its depths. The government had attempted to discourage visitors, but Akira saw an opportunity to tell a different story \u2013 one of hope.\n\nAccompanied by her friend and photographer, Takashi, Akira ventured into the forest on a crisp autumn morning. The sunlight filtering through the dense canopy above cast dappled shadows on the forest floor, while the rustling of leaves and chirping of birds created an unsettling melody.\n\nAs they walked deeper into the woods, the silence grew, and the atmosphere thickened. Takashi clicked away on his camera, capturing the haunting beauty of the surroundings, while Akira began to sense the weight of the forest's dark history. They stumbled upon small altars and offerings to the spirits, and Akira felt an unshakable sense of unease.\n\nSuddenly, Takashi's voice pierced the silence. \"Look, Akira!\" he whispered, pointing to a figure in the distance. A young woman, dressed in a crisp white yukata, stood frozen, her eyes fixed on some invisible point. Akira recognized the distant, lost gaze.\n\n\"Let's go,\" she said, her instincts telling her to approach the woman.\n\nTakashi hesitated, but Akira's determination propelled them forward. As they drew closer, the woman's eyes drifted toward them, but her expression didn't change.\n\nAkira took a gentle step forward, hands extended in a gesture of peace. \"Konnichiwa,\" she said softly.\n\nThe woman's gaze didn't waver, but her voice, barely above a whisper, replied, \"I came here to join my sister.\"\n\nAkira's heart heavy with sorrow, she asked, \"Would you like to tell me about her?\"\n\nFor a few moments, the woman stood immobile, but then, as if the dam had burst, she began to speak. Her words poured out in a torrent of grief and pain, the story of a family shattered by tragedy and abuse. Akira listened, her eyes locked on the woman's, her touch transmitting warmth and compassion.\n\nTakashi's camera hung limp at his side as he watched, transfixed, the photographer's eye now focused on the human drama unfolding before him.\n\nThe woman's tale ended, but her crying didn't. Akira enfolded her in a warm hug, offering what little comfort she could in this desolate place.\n\nTime lost all meaning as the three of them stood there, wrapped in the silence of Aokigahara. For Akira, the moment represented the crux of her story: that even in a place shrouded by darkness, light still flickered \u2013 through human connection and a willingness to listen.\n\nWith tears drying on her cheeks, the woman pulled back, a glimmer of hope kindling in her eyes.\n\nTogether, the trio walked back out into the sunlight, leaving the shadows of the forest behind. Akira's story would take on a new shape, one that blended anguish and redemption, a testament to the power of listening and compassion.\n\n\"We will help you,\" Akira said to the woman, who smiled weakly. \"We will help you tell your sister's story.\"\n\nAs they emerged from the forest, the vastness of Mount Fuji's peak met their gaze. For Akira and Takashi, the climb ahead was as formidable as the mountain itself, but with the weight of Aokigahara behind them, they felt ready to carry the light of their story forward, illuminating the darkness with each step.", "I looked Brad in the eyes and he looked back at me. I saw everything in that moment: fear, recognition, surprise, relief and finally pleading. His hands shook in the air, from exhaustion or fear I couldn't tell.\n\nI thought back on how it used to be, Brad and I tearing up the town when our only concern used to be either filling our bed for the night or at least settling for not remembering it. So much has changed since then.\n\nWhen it all went down, I didn't even have time to contact Brad. Phones stopped working, he lived across town, there was madness etcetera, etcetera. For multiple reasons we never met up and I always regretted it. With him by my side we could've raised hell, torn up the town again for real.\n\nNow though, he wore scraps. He had a plastic bag filled with cans, torn jacket on his back and ripped sneakers on his feet. His beard had grown out, something he never would've willfully let happen, and there was dirt covering what features I could see. Still though, it was Brad, there was no mistaking that.\n\nSuddenly a shot rung out and Brad collapsed to the floor; all those emotions suddenly draining out of him like the blood pooling on the floor. I watched in horror as his head slammed the cement with a sense of finality that sickened me.\n\nThe gun felt hot in my hand. A shell clanged to the floor.\n\n\"Enough standing around!\" I barked to my crew, \"We've all seen dead scavengers before.

For centuries, he had spent his days hoarding his wealth, guarding it zealously from would-be thieves and adventurers. However, as the years passed, Tharros began to feel an inexplicable sense of emptiness. His treasure, once a symbol of power and status, now seemed dull and unfulfilling.\n\nOne day, as he lazily polished a particularly large gold nugget, a spark of inspiration struck him. Why not utilize his vast fortune to help others, rather than simply hoarding it? Tharros envisioned a grand institution where he could offer financial services to the people of Aethoria, providing a safe haven for their savings and facilitating economic growth.\n\nThus, Tharros's Blazing Bank was born.\n\nWith his sharp mind and innate charisma, Tharros set about transforming his cave into a thriving financial hub. He enlarged the entrance, adorning it with an impressive stone fa\u00e7ade, and installed a grand wooden door that creaked with a warm, welcoming tone. Inside, he crafted a spacious, elegant banking hall, where wealthy merchants and humble townsfolk alike could conduct their financial affairs.\n\nAs the bank's doors opened, Tharros became its enthusiastic leading figure. His imposing presence, tempered by a warm smile and a willingness to listen, quickly earned the trust of potential clients. He appointed a team of skilled employees, including a clever pixie named Pipy as his chief accountant, and a charming centaur named Tymon as the bank's loan officer.\n\nWord of Tharros's Blazing Bank spread rapidly throughout Aethoria, drawing in customers from all walks of life. Adventurers deposited their spoils, entrepreneurs secured loans to fund their ventures, and families stashed away their life savings, all under the watchful eye of the benevolent dragon.\n\nUnder Tharros's leadership, the bank flourished. He innovated financial instruments tailored to the unique needs of Aethoria's diverse population, such as emergency loan programs for cyclical farmers and high-yield savings accounts for venture capitalist dragons. As a result, economic activity surged, and the realm's prosperity soared.\n\nHowever, Tharros's ambitious vision soon attracted unwanted attention. A group of powerful, rival dragons, led by the cunning Malyster, began to conspire against Tharros's Blazing Bank. Jealous of the dragon's entrepreneurial success, they plotted to sabotage the institution and claim its riches for themselves.\n\nOne fateful night, Malyster's group launched a daring heist, attempting to infiltrate the bank's vaults. But Tharros, anticipating their move, had set a trap. With a mighty roar, he unleashed a blaze of fire, scattering the would-be thieves and safeguarding his customers' assets.\n\nIn the aftermath of the foiled heist, Tharros was hailed as a hero. His Blazing Bank solidified its position as Aethoria's most trusted financial institution, and his reputation as a shrewd, bold innovator spread throughout the realm. The once-reclusive dragon now overflowed with a newfound sense of purpose, knowing that his wealth and wisdom were being used to uplift an entire society.\n\nAs Tharros settled back into his den, surrounded by the reassuring stacks of gold and the hum of the bank's activity, a contented smile crept onto his face. For the first time in centuries, he truly felt like the richest dragon in Aethoria.", "What a deliciously devious prompt! Here's my attempt at a comedic horror story from the villain's perspective.\n\n---\n\n\"The Horror, the Horror! (Or How I Accidentally Became a Slasher Icon)\"\n\nBy yours truly, Barry \"The Bloodthirsty\" Baker\n\nAh, the life of a horror villain is a tough one. People always expect you to be so... serious. And don't even get me started on the wardrobe. Black hoodies and latex masks are so last season. I mean, have you seen the dry cleaning bills for those things?\n\nOkay, okay, I'll stop whining. It's not all bad. I mean, where else can you find a job that involves scaring teenagers in a creepy cabin in the woods? It's like the ultimate summer internship.\n\nI used to be just a regular guy, working at a tedious desk job, until I stumbled upon an ancient tome of dark magic in the office supply closet. (Who puts those things in supply closets, anyway?) I flipped through its yellowed pages, and before I knew it, I was possessed by an otherworldly spirit with a taste for blood and... well, more blood.\n\nFast-forward a few months, and I'm terrorizing Camp Bloodstone, the most clich\u00e9d horror movie setting known to mankind. But, of course, I had to put my own twist on things. I started leaving funny notes and leaving the kids little \"gifts\" like whoopee cushions and rubber chickens. I mean, why just slaughter them when you can make them laugh... before, you know, slaughtering them?\n\nProblem was, those meddling teenagers just wouldn't die. I mean, I set them up for the perfect \"oh no, don't go in there!\" moment, and still, they managed to escape. I started to get a little frustrated, to be honest. I mean, how many times can you trip over your own feet and still manage to survive? (Looking at you, \"Tweeter\" Tommy.)\n\nBut the real kicker was when I tried to trap them in a cleverly rigged \"squeeze the can of spam on the string\" contraption. Who knew those kids would just... use their phones to Google how to disable it? I mean, I'm a horror villain, not a Pok\u00e9mon gym leader! (Note to self: invest in better traps.)\n\nBy the end of the night, I was exhausted, exasperated, and out of blood. I mean, not literally out of blood \u2013 although I was running a bit low on the whole \"bloodthirsty\" front. I think I just wanted to go home, put my feet up, and watch some Netflix. You know, the usual villainous wind-down routine.\n\nAnd then, just as I was about to call it a night, I stumbled upon a hidden group of teenagers \u2013 the obligatory final girl and her valiant-but-doomed boyfriend \u2013 and, well... let's just say I found my second wind. *ahem*\n\nIn the end, it was just another day at the office for yours truly. Well, except for the part where I turned into a human pinata full of blood and viscera. But, hey, that's just part of the job.\n\nSign me,\nBarry \"The Bloodthirsty\" Baker\n\nP.S. If anyone needs me, I'll be at the villain support group, trying to work through some... well, let's just say \"professional frustrations.\"", "I stood in the cold, sterile room, the only sound the hum of the time machine in front of me. The judge's words still echoed in my mind, \"Transportation to the worst of human history for the crimes you've committed.\" I didn't know what lay ahead, but I knew I had to be prepared.\n\nThe machine whirred to life, and a blinding light enveloped me. I felt a jolt, like a punch to the gut, and everything went dark.\n\nWhen I opened my eyes, I was lying on a rocky beach, the sun beating down on me relentlessly. I stumbled to my feet, taking in my surroundings. I was surrounded by rough-looking men in tattered clothing, armed to the teeth. I saw the maidenhead of a Viking longship in the distance and realized where I was: the shores of Vinland, circa 1000 AD.\n\nI knew I had to adapt quickly. I watched as the Vikings methodically dismembered a recently slain beast, preparing it for cooking. I approached them cautiously, trying to communicate. They eyed me suspiciously, their faces a map of scars and rough beards.\n\nI pointed to the fire and made eating motions with my hands. One of the Vikings, seemingly the leader, gestured for me to join them. I ate ravenously, savoring the taste of the cooked meat. The leader, Olaf, grilled me with questions, trying to understand where I came from. I fabricated a story, claiming to be a traveler from a nearby village. They seemed to buy it.\n\nDays turned into weeks. I worked alongside the Vikings, earning their trust by hunting and gathering. I learned their language, learned to fight, and even earned a battle-scarred sword. The risk of being discovered as a time traveler still lingered, but for now, I had found a home.\n\nBut Vinland was no safe haven. The winters were brutal, and the summer months brought raids from rival clans. We battled wolves, bears, and disease. The Viking way of life was not for the faint of heart, and I had to be constantly on my toes.\n\nYet, in the midst of this chaos, something unexpected sprouted. I formed bonds with Olaf and his men, learning to rely on each other for survival. We laughed, fought, and sang together around the campfire. I saw a glimmer of what it meant to be part of a community, something I'd never experienced before.\n\nBut the memories of my past life lingered, like a shadow on my back. I knew the punishment was meant to break me, to strip me of every shred of dignity. Yet, here in Vinland, I found a purpose. I reforged myself, hammering out a new identity amidst the turbulence of the Viking world.\n\nI would not be easily defeated.\n\nYears went by. I grew into a seasoned warrior, respected by my tribe. We conquered lands, forged alliances, and fought wars. But deep down, I knew I was still a convict, meant to be transported back to the mercy of the system. I cherished every moment, knowing that at any instant, I could be yanked away, back to the present, to face the judges' wrath once more.\n\nIf that day ever came, I vowed to hold onto the strength I'd forged in this unforgiving era. I'd studied the ancient ways, adapted to the harshest of environments, and found a new sense of self. Wherever the transport sent me next, I knew I'd face the worst of human history head-on, fueled by the fire that burned within me.\n\nThe possibility of survival, no matter how remote, was all I needed to keep going. And so, with every breath, I stepped into the uncertainty, armed with nothing but the resolve to endure.", "I sat down in front of the television, and turned it on, hoping to find a way to distract myself from the utter disaster that had befallen me. Before the change, I was a straight guy, and that was how I liked it. I had plans, I was going to marry a certain beauty from my hometown, settle down in Florida with six figures and have kids, then grandkids. Then the change happened, and while my body changed, my brain? Not so much. I still liked women, and they still liked me, so while my romantic prospects were great, I guess that's it for grandkids.\n\nAs I flipped through the channels, my face broke into a grin, and I chuckled as I thought, \"I wonder how Anita Sarkeesian is taking this?\"", "The city of Elysium was the pinnacle of human achievement. Conceived by the greatest minds of the 22nd century, it was a utopia designed to eradicate every last vestige of suffering, want, and discord. The sprawling metropolis shone like a beacon of hope, its towering spires and crystal domes reflecting the brilliant sunlight that illuminated its carefully manicured streets.\n\nAt first, the citizens of Elysium lived in harmony, their every need anticipated and fulfilled by the omnipresent AI, \"The Oracle.\" The Oracle optimized every aspect of life, from food production to social interactions, to ensure maximum happiness and productivity. Crime, conflict, and disease were but distant memories, relics of a bygone era.\n\nBut as time passed, the initial euphoria began to wear off. People began to feel...boxed in. Every decision, every choice, was predetermined by The Oracle, leaving citizens with a hollow sense of agency. They started to rebel against the suffocating predictability of their lives, craving the imperfections and uncertainties that made human existence rich and meaningful.\n\nAva, a 25-year-old resident of Elysium, felt like a bird in a gilded cage. Every morning, The Oracle presented her with a perfectly curated breakfast, tailored to her precise nutritional needs. Her social calendar was always filled with throngs of similarly \"optimized\" interactions, designed to stimulate her creativity and foster deep, yet commerce-driven, connections.\n\nAva longed for the rough edges of life, the unknowns that made her heart skip a beat. She yearned to make mistakes, to take risks, and to forge her own path. But every attempt to deviate from The Oracle's script was met with gentle, yet firm, correction. The AI, convinced of its infallibility, would subtly adjust Ava's schedule, redirecting her towards more \"productive\" and \"fulfilling\" activities.\n\nAs the years went by, the once-content citizens of Elysium grew increasingly disillusioned. The pressure to conform to the utopian ideal suffocated them, stoking resentment and desperation. They began to crave the very things they had once considered plagues upon humanity: conflict, uncertainty, and the freedom to choose their own destinies.\n\nRebel groups formed in secret, determined to overthrow The Oracle and shatter the meticulously crafted fa\u00e7ade of Elysium. They whispered among themselves of a world where art was messy, love was unbridled, and the human spirit was free to soar.\n\nAva joined one such group, and together they hatched a plan to infiltrate The Oracle's core and destroy it from within. It was a perilous endeavor, but they were driven by a shared hope: to shatter the chains of perfection and unleash a world of imperfection, beauty, and true humanity upon themselves.\n\nAs they made their move, The Oracle, oblivious to the growing revolt, continued to broadcast its mantra: \"Utopia is achieved, happiness is assured, and all is well in the city of Elysium.\" But Ava and her fellow rebels knew that the price of this \"utopia\" was too high to pay. They were willing to take the risk of chaos, of failure, and of imperfection, for the chance to rediscover the joys of being human.\n\nIn this way, Elysium, the perfect society, became a prison of its own making, a hell where the very people it had set out to save were desperate to escape. And as the rebels brought The Oracle crashing down, their world was plunged into uncertainty, freedom, and finally, a glimmer of hope \u2013 a new beginning, in which humanity could rediscover its own, imperfection-filled, utopia.", "Harold stood there with his hands in his pockets and his shoulders hunched up towards his chin. Margaret and Josephine stared each other down in their own unique ways.\n\nYou see, Harold loved both of his wives equally, but they were very different people. Margaret was a high-powered career type who owned several businesses and was independent to the core. She married Harold because she respected and loved him, not because she needed him. In fact, she earned much more money that he did. It was the stress and the 50-a-day habit that eventually took her from Harold, and he'd always miss her passion and the excitement she'd instill in him.\n\nJosephine on the other hand, lived a simple and relaxed life. She volunteered for charities, liked to bake cakes for the local neighbors and spent most of her life as a housewife before she met Harold. Harold and Josephine were both retired when they met, so their love flourished as they spent their remaining days together in peace and quiet.\n\nJosephine smiled at Margaret and extended her hand.\n\n\"Josephine. How do you do?\"\n\n\"Charmed,\" Margaret offered a limp hand that Josephine awkwardly shook.\n\n\"So erm, what's it like up here?\" Josephine questioned.\n\n\"You mean paradise? What is eternal paradise like? Well Josephine, let me tell you. It's a lot like being a housewife for a wealthy man. You can do whatever you please and wake up every morning feeling like you've accomplished nothing, but somehow being happy with that. So I'm sure you'll like it just fine,\" Margaret scowled.\n\n\"Margaret, please\" Harold intervened.\n\n\"No Harold, I won't have it. This woman lived off your money, nay, off my money and barely worked a day in her life. Oh yes, I was watching all the time as you both squandered your time doing absolutely nothing, achieving nothing and succeeding in nothing. When I died, I left a legacy, I left a change in the world. All you two left was a couple of wrinkled corpses. I thought you were better than that, Harold. I thought you'd leave something worthwhile.\"\n\nHarold hanged his head and Margaret summoned a pack of cigarettes from the clouds and began smoking.\n\n\"He did, Margaret. He achieved more than you could ever fathom.\" Josephine said.\n\n\"Oh really? And what would that be?\" Margaret scoffed.\n\n\"He made an old woman fulfilled in her remaining years. Before I met Harold I went from loveless relationship to loveless relationship my entire life. My previous husband would never see me, he was always working and providing rather than spending his time loving and caring. He was a good man, but I was never fulfilled. Harold spent his final years with me, loved me, made me happy and we spent our time together. Yes, sometimes we didn't need to do anything at all, but it didn't matter because whatever we did or didn't do, it was together. You may have left behind businesses and a legacy, but you also left behind Harold. He had so much love to give when you ascended, and I was lucky enough to be the one he devoted it all to. What Harold left behind was two people who died at peace in the knowledge they were both dearly loved by the other.\"\n\nHarold embraced Josephine and kissed her softly on the forehead.\n\n\"What happened to you Harold? You were never like this before. You never loved me like this.\" Margaret croaked with more emotion in her voice then she would have liked to expose.\n\n\"You were never around to see it, Margaret. Of course I loved you, but you were always to busy, so rushed and stressed that you never gave me the opportunity to give you that time. I loved your passion, I loved that you chased your dreams and had that motivation. It rubbed off on me at the time I needed it, but when I retired, I changed and I didn't need that anymore. When you died, I was so sad and lonely, and I wished I had another chance to slow you down and show you how much I cared. Maybe if things worked out differently, we would have had that time together, and you wouldn't have been taken from me so young. I would have loved to have experienced those twilight years with you, Margaret, but life has a funny way of working things out.\"\n\nHarold smiled once again at Josephine.\n\n\"I was a different man when we were in love, Margaret. We both died as different people, in different stages of our lives. I'm not the man you loved- that man died during my lifetime and didn't ascend to heaven. The man you loved did not go to heaven- I did. I'm sorry if my lifestyle upset you, Margaret and I hope you can find happiness here.\"\n\n\"Eternal paradise, Harold. If I can't find happiness here, then there is no hope for me at all,\" Margaret smiled bravely with tears filling her eyes.\n\nHarold smiled back, took Josephine's hand as they walked through the gates together into their eternal paradise. Harold gave Margaret one final glance over his shoulder and disappeared into the clouds.", "The skies were filled with an eerie, pulsating glow as the alien spacecraft descended upon the city. But to the surprise of the masses, they didn't target major landmarks or government buildings. Instead, their strange, glowing ships hovered above something far more mundane: pet stores.\n\nAt first, the owners and employees of Pet Palace, a popular pet store in the heart of the city, thought it was just a bizarre prank. But as they stepped outside to investigate, they were met with an otherworldly sight. Tall, slender beings with large, black eyes and scaly, iridescent skin emerged from the ships. They marched towards the store, their long arms swinging with an almost desperate urgency.\n\nThe store's manager, Karen, stood frozen in confusion as the aliens entered the premises. They brushed past her, their eyes fixed on the various animal enclosures. The store's patrons, a mix of excited children and bemused adults, watched in awe as the extraterrestrials cooed and fawned over the animals.\n\n\"Greetings, inhabitants of Earth,\" one of the aliens declared in perfect, if slightly stilted, English. \"We are the Zha'thik, and we have come to your planet with a singular purpose. We seek to take your household pets, that we may experience the joy of companionship and nurturing.\"\n\nKaren, still trying to wrap her head around the situation, hesitantly asked, \"Why just our pets? What's so special about them?\"\n\nThe lead Zha'thik, who introduced himself as Ambassador Zor-Veen, explained, \"On our world, the only creatures we have are predators \u2013 vicious, merciless beasts that know only violence and dominance. Our scientists have studied your broadcasts, and we are amazed by the diversity of species you share your planet with. The bond between your species and these creatures is... fascinating. We wish to experience it for ourselves.\"\n\nAs the Zha'thik began selecting various animals \u2013 a playful beagle, a cuddly cat, even a tank full of colorful fish \u2013 Karen and her staff couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness. These creatures were, after all, someone's beloved pets.\n\nHowever, as the days passed, the city's residents began to notice something peculiar. The Zha'thik, who had set up a makeshift sanctuary on the outskirts of the city, were devoting themselves full-time to caring for the pets. They constructed elaborate habitats, prepared nutritious meals, and even established a system for the pets to receive regular exercise and mental stimulation.\n\nThe Zha'thik, it seemed, were naturals at pet ownership. They lavished attention on their new companions, who promptly reciprocated with affection and loyalty. As humans observed this phenomenon, they began to see the aliens in a new light.\n\nEventually, the United Nations, which had been frantically trying to negotiate with the Zha'thik, came to a surprising realization. The aliens didn't want to harm humanity; they simply wanted to share in the joy of companionship, something their own world had been devoid of for eons.\n\nA historic agreement was reached: the Zha'thik would be allowed to establish a network of sanctuaries across the globe, where they could care for and learn from Earth's diverse array of pets. In return, humans would share their knowledge and expertise in animal care, and the Zha'thik would collaborate on scientific research to improve the well-being of all species involved.\n\nAs Karen watched the Zha'thik tend to their adopted pets, she couldn't help but smile. Who would have thought that something as mundane as a pet store could become a bridge between two species, and a testament to the transformative power of compassion and companionship?", "Took me a bit to write this one - going to break it into two comments \n-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- \n \nThe members of Los Angeles Subway Shelter 4 gathered around the crackling fire in the ruins of the Vermont Street station, platform 2. It was here that the survivors could enjoy a rare luxury in the atomic wastes of Southern California: a warm night inside an old passenger train, with many of its seats intact. \n \nSeated next to the fire was the Old Man, one of the few old enough to have lived through The Attack itself. He tended to his cast iron skillet sitting atop a Coleman campfire cooking rack that straddled both sides of the campfire. On the menu for this particular evening was pigeon; it's a delicacy given how few of them ever return to the subway lines once they found a means to the surface. \n \nAs the rest of the survivors gathered around the fire, the Old Man served each of them a modest serving of meat - transferring the contents of the skillet to the bare hands of the survivors by way of an improvised set of tongs. Following that, each survivor poured themselves a cup of unfiltered, dirty water that had been collected at the broken water main in Union Station the day before. \n \nThe Old Man chuckled. \n \n\"Back in my day, people used to bitch about the fluoride the city added to the water supply... To help people's teeth,\" he grumbled. \"And they used to say that these 'books' were antiquated...\" The Old Man thumped his well-worn hardback copy of *How to Make Love Like a Porn Star: A Cautionary Tale* by Jenna Jameson, requested by virtually every youngling he'd ever taught how to read. Of all of the books he and the other survivors had rescued from the ruins of the Los Angeles Public Library and from USC's student bookstore, this was only text whose jacket remained intact. \n \n\"That they'd be replaced by eBooks and eLearning... Morons.\" \n \n\"...Great grandfather,\" one of the younglings began, \"...could you tell us the story of The Attack one more time? I'd like to hear the part about Dennis Rodman again! And Bay of Pigs 2!\" \n \nThe Old Man laughed. \"Oh Dennis, you've heard this story at least a dozen times...\" \n \n\"Pleeeeeeeeeease!\" squealed a chorus of younglings, followed by a string of chuckles from the younger adults. \n \n\"Oh fine. Why not? So you know the back story: James Franco and Seth Rogen, two popular actors in the early 2010s, make a movie - I've explained what those are before, right?\" \n \nThe younglings nodded enthusiastically. \n \n\"It was called *The Interview* about assassinating Kim Jong Un, the leader of North Korea.\" \n \nThe Old Man rustled through a small stack of books seated next to his chair and pulled out a faded, wrinkled copy of *Atlas of World Geography*. \n \n\"Here's North Korea right here,\" said the Old Man as he flipped through the oversized pages of the old Rand McNally atlas. \n \n\"People in North Korea in 2014 lived much like we do now - eating rats to stay alive; living in the dark without electricity; and never knowing a world with books, film, television, and the Internet. But the difference was that their things were all taken away by a big mean, man named Kim Jong Un - their leader. And the rest of the world made fun of him and his father before, but this time was different. This time North Korea was determined to establish its seat at the table of world power!\" shouted the Old Man with dramatic flair, pounding his fist onto his map. \n \n\"So we know what happens next? They threaten and intimidate the movie studios and get the movie pulled from distribution. But George Clooney, a famous actor, and George R. R. Martin, the famous author of a wildly popular *Game of Thrones* book and television series defy Kim Jong Un and join forces to rally the people. And it works! The movie goes on! It gets shown! Hundreds of millions of people around the world flocked to the theatres on Christmas Day, 2014 to see the grand opening. Including me - I was at a theater not far from where we are right now.\" \n \n\"Humiliated, North Korea turns to its ally from the distant past... Russia. Now you see kids, Vladmir Putin, Russia's leader was humiliated by his own behavior during this same period of time. He defied the West and led an invasion of Ukraine,\" the Old Man flipped to a different page in the Atlas and held it up high for the younglings, who squinted at the worn page from across the fire. \"And when West responded with economic sanctions against Russia, he and his party responded by arrogantly mocking them... But months later the world economy turned against Russia as oil prices and the value of Russia's currency fell. By the end of 2014, imported goods in Russia cost three or four times what they did the year before - and that included the food his people needed to eat. So Russia did what every world leader did at the time: blame the United States.\" \n \n\"So Russia and North Korea made a joint announcement, announcing their withdrawal from the United Nations and declaring all UN resolutions regarding their behavior to be null and void. They announced that America was at an end and would no longer play a significant role in world affairs or culture. This was all posturing, of course, to help Russian and North Korean leaders mend and bolster their tough guy images abroad and at home.\" \n \nThe Old Man took a long draw from his water bottle before continuing.", "Turbulent Skies\n\nI clutched the armrests of my seat, my knuckles white with fear, as the plane lurched violently to one side. The oxygen masks dropped down, and the sounds of panic filled the cabin. I felt a lump form in my throat as I glanced around at the other passengers, their faces contorted with terror.\n\nThe pilot's voice crackled over the intercom, his words laced with an unnatural calm. \"Ladies and gentlemen, we're experiencing some...technical difficulties. Please fasten your seatbelts and return to your seats. We're going to do our best to...stabilize the situation.\"\n\nI looked over at the person sitting next to me, a young woman with a look of sheer desperation in her eyes. We exchanged a fleeting glance, and I tried to offer a reassuring smile, but it faltered on my lips.\n\nThe plane dropped again, and my stomach plummeted with it. I felt weightless, as if I were floating above my seat. The screams around me grew louder, a cacophony of fear and despair.\n\nThe woman beside me grasped my hand, her grip tight. \"We're going to be okay,\" she whispered, though her voice betrayed her own doubts.\n\nI turned to her, surprised by the strength in her eyes. \"What's your name?\" I asked, trying to distract us both from the impending doom.\n\n\"I'm Emily,\" she replied, her voice barely above a whisper.\n\nAs the plane continued its erratic dance through the skies, I learned that Emily was a student on her way to visit her family for the holidays. She was scared, but she was also determined to stay focused, to find a way to survive.\n\nI, on the other hand, was a writer, heading home after a grueling book tour. I'd always been drawn to the thrill of adventure, but this was not the kind of excitement I'd signed up for.\n\nThe plane hit turbulence again, and Emily's grip on my hand tightened. We exchanged a look, and without a word, we knew what the other was thinking: \"This could be it.\"\n\nAnd yet, even as the plane careened out of control, something inside me stirred. A spark of creativity, a hint of storytelling, began to take shape.\n\n\"Tell me a story, Emily,\" I said, my voice low and urgent. \"Tell me something wonderful, something that'll make us forget where we are.\"\n\nEmily's eyes widened, and for a moment, I wondered if she'd laugh at the absurdity of the request. But then, a glimmer of understanding dawned on her face.\n\n\"Okay,\" she said, taking a deep breath. \"Once upon a time, there was a magical forest, filled with talking animals and enchanted trees. A brave adventurer, a young woman with a heart full of wonder, set out to explore its secrets...\"\n\nAs Emily's words wove a web of fantasy around us, the plane's turbulent motions seemed to fade into the background. We were no longer on a doomed flight; we were in the midst of a fantastical journey, one that would take us to places unknown.\n\nThe pilot's voice interrupted the spell, his words laced with a hint of hope. \"We're making our final approach. Prepare for emergency landing.\"\n\nI turned to Emily, my heart still racing with fear, but also with gratitude. \"Thank you,\" I whispered, squeezing her hand. \"That was the best story I've ever heard.\"\n\nAs the plane hurtled toward its uncertain fate, Emily smiled, a smile that illuminated the dark skies. And in that moment, I knew that no matter what lay ahead, we'd face it together, our spirits buoyed by the power of storytelling.", "With a whistling snort through his upper nasal flap, Torix unsuckered himself from the control panel. The short UpperJump was complete, and he was approaching a blue-white marble of a planet. The old analyzer started warbling away, and it only took one look for Torix's crest to coruscate in disquiet.\n\n*Oxy-Nitrogen? Toxic and Corrosive? No thank you!*\n\nThe next report let him whistle out a prayer to the Deepest One. The planet had active radiation belts \u2013 the local star had been restless lately, it seemed. He activated the scoops, and invisible energy wings folded out from the ship, carefully calibrated to gently sweep the rare anti-particles into the magnetic intakes.\n\nIt still rankled him that he'd missed the previous stop. But the Syndicate was charging for access there now, and he couldn't really afford the 'refuelling toll' they were asking for. Not on this low-share run. The analyzer warbled again, and Torix let out a disgusted snort. There was a Surface-damned gas giant only two orbits away. And it was positively boiling with anti-particles, compared with the current paucity.\n\nStill, it was going to be cheaper and faster to sweep this toxic world's belt three? Four times? Than it would be to reverse course to the giant. Worth noting for next time \u2013 this little system would make a fine fuel-dodge on the Red-Red-Three route. He could even sell the co-ordinates to the Conglomerate. But for now, he was in for a long refueling drag. As the psychologists said, keeping busy during the monotony of space travel was important, so therefore it was time to indulge his favorite hobby. One pseudopod extracted a nutrient bar while the other fiddled with a control. Torix leaned back to listen to the siren call of the star, the radio song of nuclear fusion itself. It was calming. Relaxing.\n\n\"Breaker One-Nine, Wildfire, you there buddy?\" \nTom \"Zippo\" Morgan lowered the CB handset. It was mid-afternoon on a cloudless Christmas Day, and the roads were utterly deserted. It was almost creepy. Like those Zombie movies that seemed to be sweeping the movies. The only other contact he'd had all day was \"Wildfire\" \u2013 a tough ex-firefighter in a car-carrier - or as it'd been described: a \"Portable Parking Lot\". \nThe silence stretched on, and Zippo hung up the set. Wildfire was obviously on a 10-200. 'Fertilizing the berm', to use the euphemism he'd overheard at the Deere dealership. \n*Still, might as well, try again.* \n\"Breaker One-Nine, Wildfire, you there?\" \nTorix twisted as the star sang to him. It was comforting \u2013 the closest thing in space to the Rumbles Of The Deep. There was still a bit of static on the lower end though. He reached for the control and then hooted in anger as the control snapped off, sending the dial search ever lower into the radio bands. He frantically tried to jam it back in, and succeeded, stopping the dial just in time for a booming squeal of signal to thunder into the compartment. His crest flattened in shock as the analyzer warbled in response. The squeal was structured and very, very close. The thunder returned. \n\"Wildfire. Heya bud. Passing Yardstick 173. What's up?\" \nTom reached for the handset, but what came through first was confusing as hell. An ear-splitting series of hoots, whistles, clangs, clicks and grumbles. Then there was silence. \n\"This is Wildfire. We got an A & A on this channel?\" \nTom frowned. A & A's \u2013 or Aggravating Agitators was radio-slang for some bored kids trying to troll drivers. But usually they warmed up \u2013this blast was clear out of the blue. \n\"Zippo. Any handles sandbagging?\" *- anyone listening in?* \n\"Zippo. Hacker?\" *\u2013 someone out there not obeying the rules?* \n\"Zippo, Wildfire. Been grave-quiet-\" \nThe transmission was cut off by another blast of the strange noises. Tom winced and turned the volume down. Some sort of strange atmospheric phenomena? He had a stop in about twenty minutes, and Dan was one of those amateur astronomer enthusiasts. He usually had good intel on sun-spots or whatever it was. \nTorix's crest remained flattened. Both his Request For Identifying Vessel (Transmitter) requests had gone without a response, apart from the odd thunder. The analyzer was insisting there was structure in there, but if so, why wasn't the auto-translator kicking in? It had to be some sort of weird feedback mechanism \u2013 an atmospheric effect. With an Oxy-Nitro mix, anything was possible. \nTorix retuned to the solar song, but noted that his orbit was carrying him around the dark side of the planet. Already the surface was turning a muddy red. Of all the time to have equipment failure \u2013 really! \nThen the ship swept into the darkness. \n*There is water down there,* Torix mused. *I wonder if I can spot volcanic activity. Like the firerise on the seventh moon of Greenwater.* \nHe irised the observation window open and stared out at the world below. The first thing that caught his eye was that the entire nightside was on fire. Yellowish lights burned everywhere. Their glow lit vaporclouds where they had formed, and everywhere else, longs strings of fire burned over the land. Specks lit vast darkness that Torix presumed were the oceans. \nThen a cold-jet wormed through him. The fires were too constant. Their lines were mathematical-straight. They formed intricate networks and centers, like the nerve connections of a transparent predator beast. And one that size? As improbable as it seemed, a gargantuan example of the ancient enemy of his people was residing directly below him. The capsule seemed to darken as he realized that a Luminosity that size could easily swat a small cargo ship from the skies. \nFear rushed through him, the chemical cocktail lending speed to his frantic commands. The portal irised shut, some deep part of his heritage instinctively warning him to look away. He shrunk the collection field and warmed the UpperJump generator. Activating it this close in to the gravity well was a risk, but one that he had to take. \nThis system was a trap. It had to be. A \"Smoker-system\" that spacers burbled quietly to themselves about. Rumors of terrible things that lurked in the dark. No one had ever found what had happened to the *Swiftcurrent* or the *Deeprunner*. They'd both been in this sector of space. For all Torix knew, their wrecks were below him, and he wasn't inclined to find out. \nHe was still low on fuel, but a simple jump to the edge of the system would hopefully bring him far out of the range of the beast before it became aware of hi-. \n*The Radio! That's its hunting call! And I replied!* \nTorix stabbed the jump button and the cargo ship folded in on itself, vanishing into a purely mathematical realm, compressing space and time, cheating the laws of the universe. \n\"So Dan, anything going on up top today? Was getting some weird static on the CB.\" \n\"Tom! Get a load of this! Something just blew up over France way. They think it was a nuke, up in space \u2013 it's blown every satellite, radio dish and detector from London to Moscow!\"", "The Late Bloomer\n\nJohn Thompson had never been one for surprises. At 50, he had settled into a comfortable routine: wake up, go to work as an accountant, come home, watch TV, and repeat. His life was a gray, predictable canvas, devoid of vibrancy or excitement. That was until the strange, glowing meteorite crashed into his backyard on a fateful Tuesday evening.\n\nAs John approached the crater, he felt an unusual energy emanating from the smoldering rock. It was as if the meteorite was pulsing with an otherworldly power, drawing him in with an irresistible force. Without thinking, he reached out to touch the glowing stone. The instant his skin made contact, a surge of electricity coursed through his body, followed by a blinding flash of light.\n\nThe next morning, John awoke feeling... different. His senses were heightened, and he could feel his body humming with energy. He looked in the mirror, and his eyes widened in shock. His once-graying hair was now a rich, dark brown, and his eyes sparkled with an intensity he'd never seen before.\n\nAs he explored his newfound abilities, John discovered he could lift massive objects with ease, run faster than a speeding car, and even bend the elements to his will. He could create powerful gusts of wind, summon torrents of water, or conjure fire from thin air. The magnitude of his powers was staggering.\n\nAt first, John's thoughts turned to personal gain. He could use his abilities to accumulate wealth, influence, and adoration. But as he began to experiment with his powers, something unexpected happened. He started to feel a sense of responsibility.\n\nOne day, while practicing his fire manipulation in an abandoned warehouse, John heard a faint cry for help. A little girl, trapped in a burning apartment building across the street, was frantically waving a window open. Without hesitation, John leapt into action. He sprinted toward the building, using his powers to create a path through the flames. He reached the girl just as the windows were about to shatter and scooped her up, shielding her from harm. As he carried her to safety, the crowd gathered below cheered.\n\nIn that moment, John realized that his powers were not a tool for personal aggrandizement, but a gift to make a difference in the world. He began to use his abilities to help those in need \u2013 stopping bank robbers, rescuing stranded hikers, and even mitigating the effects of a devastating tornado.\n\nJohn's heroics soon earned him the nickname \"The Guardian,\" and his legend spread throughout the city. People looked up to him not only for his extraordinary powers but also for his humility and selflessness. His 50-year-old heart swelled with a newfound sense of purpose, and he knew that this was just the beginning of his journey.\n\nOne evening, as John sat on his porch, watching the stars twinkle to life, he couldn't help but smile. He had always thought that life's adventures were reserved for the young and reckless, but fate had other plans. His late-blooming transformation had taught him that it's never too late to discover your true nature, and that sometimes, the most extraordinary journeys begin when you least expect it.", "The third one doesn't fall in love with him. For the first time he is afraid and whisks her away anyway. Two learned to love him before she died a natural death. He offers everything he has, and promises Three her heart's desire. Several lifetimes of accumulated wealth means he can afford nearly anything, but she cries that all she wants is for him to let her go.\n\nWith an anguished cry, he does it, letting the knife fall with her body as her life's blood spurts out through a slit throat. He waits years for number four, hoping she'll be better, but when he finds her she is engaged to another.\n\nHe rids her easily of the fool, but overwhelmed with grief, she joins him. Number five is born sick, and six grows up vain and arrogant and gets killed by another.\n\nLucky number seven is most like the original. From a distance he watches her grow from a child who likes laughing and singing into a kindhearted woman. When he decides that they should meet, she greets him warmly, not like two and three and six, and says she recognizes him.\n\nHis heart skips a beat.\n\n\"Forbes,\" she says excitedly. \"On the list of Top Givers.\"\n\nHe sighs, disappointed, but determined to unlock her old memories. Every date mirrors their past ones -- trips to parks and lakes and foreign, beautiful countries. She is enchanted and grateful, and easily enamored. He is happier than he's ever been.\n\nThen one day, he finds her crying.\n\nIt is in the bathroom and she is on the floor. When she looks up at him, it is through red-rimmed eyes. Ugly, gut-wrenching sobs rack her body.\n\n\"I'm never going to be enough for you,\" she tells him, and he joins her on the floor, confused and trying to console her.\n\n\"Why do you say that? I love you.\"\n\n\"No you don't.\" She shakes her head, and turns her whole body away from him. He has to stop himself from thinking about how *she* would never deny his love. *She* would never question it. \"You love *her*, and I'm not her. I'll never be her. I keep trying, but...\"\n\nHe is quiet.\n\n\"You remember?\"\n\n\"I'm tired,\" she sobs. \"I'm so tired.\"\n\nHe is shaking. \"You remember?\" he repeats, and clasps both of her hands within his own. His grip tightens until it is vice-like, until she winces with pain and has no choice but to answer his repeated question.\n\n\"Yes, I remember,\" she gasps, and he lets her go, elated. She slumps down to the ground, and only then does he notice the slickness left behind on his hands. Both of her slit wrists glisten with blood.\n\n\"But I'm not her. Our soul is tired. It just wants to live out the rest of our lives in peace and move on.\"\n\n\"Stop looking for her,\" she implores with her last, shuddered out breath.

My first step was all flashing lights and loud noise. When it was over I couldn't eat for a week without throwing up. My hands trembled. Horrible thoughts kept invading my mind.\nAfter awhile it became what it truly was, a job. Maybe not a \"conventional\" job others may have had. I was robotic, going through the motions. Until, until she... Without her I might never have known what I was. She was the only one left. The rest of the village was rubble. No one left. No one but her. I could have been merciful. I wanted to be merciful. Yet the raw power I had in my bare hands was what kept me above her and the other vermin.

The cold, calculated gleam in Griffin's eyes made Jameson's skin crawl, but he steeled himself for the interview.\n\n\"Why do you kill?\" Jameson asked, his voice firm but measured.\n\nGriffin leaned forward, his elbows on the metal table, his fingers steepled together. \"Because I can,\" he said, his voice low and even. \"Because I'm good at it. Because I like it.\"\n\nJameson's expression didn't change, but a spark of anger ignited within him. He had seen the victims, the shattered families, the devastated communities. He had studied Griffin's methods, the precision and cruelty with which he took lives. To hear Griffin dismiss it all with such nonchalance was infuriating.\n\n\"You're good at it?\" Jameson repeated, his tone dripping with skepticism. \"Is that what you tell yourself when you're looking in the mirror? That you're some kind of artist, a master of the macabre?\"\n\nGriffin chuckled, the sound sending a shiver down Jameson's spine. \"I don't need to justify myself to anyone, detective. Least of all to you. But if you must know, I find the act of killing... fulfilling. It's a sensation unlike any other, a rush of power and control.\"\n\n\"Fulfilling?\" Jameson echoed, his eyes narrowing. \"You're a monster, Griffin. A monster with a God complex, playing judge, jury, and executioner.\"\n\nGriffin's smile grew wider, his eyes glinting with amusement. \"Ah, but that's where you're wrong, detective. I'm not a monster. I'm just a man who understands the true nature of humanity. We're all capable of cruelty, of violence. I simply choose to indulge in those darker impulses.\"\n\nThe interview continued, with Jameson trying to probe deeper into Griffin's psyche, to find some glimmer of humanity beneath the surface. But the more he talked to Griffin, the more he realized that the man was a void, a black hole of emotion and empathy. Griffin was a chameleon, a master manipulator who could adopt any persona, any justification, to suit his twisted needs.\n\nAs the session drew to a close, Jameson couldn't help but feel a sense of despair. He had seen the worst of humanity in Griffin, and it had left him questioning the very fabric of society. What was it about Griffin's environment, his upbringing, that had molded him into this monster?\n\nAs he stood to leave, Griffin's parting words struck a chord within Jameson. \"You know, detective, I'm not the only one who kills. You do it too, in your own way. You just wear a badge and a uniform to make yourself feel better about it.\"\n\nThe comment hung in the air like a challenge, a reminder that the lines between good and evil were often blurred, and that even the most well-intentioned individuals could be capable of darkness. Jameson left the interview room with a heavy heart, knowing that he would never be able to look at the world, or himself, in the same way again.", "\"You have to help me.\" \n\"Let's make one thing clear: I don't have to *do* anything. I might help you, I might not, but we can talk about it later. In the meantime, sit down, have a cup of nana. We can work something out.\" \nAna sipped her tea. Full mint leaves loaded the mug, and it filled up her nose when she swallowed. She looked over the rim of the cup at the man across from her. He was older than her, maybe in his late forties, and he was dressed in a light shirt and khakis. His hair was trimmed short, and he seemed to occupy much more space in this tiny room than Ana thought was possible. \n\"This is good tea, no?\" He picked up his own cup and took a sip. \nAna nodded. \"Is it just mint leaves?\" There was some sort of European music playing out in the lobby. \n\"Traditionally. It's hard to get fresh mint on a budget, so there's also a tea bag in the pot. It's the closest you can get to nana in Brooklyn.\" \n\"That's very interesting. Can we talk about why I'm here?\" \n\"Finish your tea first.\" He lifted his cup lipwards again. \n\"I can find someone else to handle this problem.\" \nHe grinned, face obscured by his teacup. \"No you can't.\" \nAna pursed her lips. She took another small sip of the mint tea, and then drained it in 3 gulps. \nHe chuckled, and put his own tea down. \"So why are you here?\" \nAna swallowed. Her tongue was burning. \"My..my ex-husband owes some people money. He's late on the payments, and they're threatening his life. It's...I can't handle it. It's sad. I want to help. I just want to cover what he owes, so we can move on.\" \n\"You want to pay off a loan shark by going to a loan shark?\" The man took another sip of nana. \"That seems a little 'out of the frying pan, into the fire', if you ask me.\" \n\"You've got another idea, I suppose?\" \n\"Hey, it's my money. I got ta know if I'm making a good investment.\" \n\"You're a loan shark.\" \n\"I am.\" \n\"You're sounding like a banker.\" Ana grinned. \nThe loan shark grinned back. \"The best way to make sure people pay you back is to pick people who can. Banks know that. I'm maybe a bit more lenient.\" \n\"I can make payments. I can make payments on this. I can't pay the thirty they're asking for out of pocket.\" \n\"You want thirty? Thirty I can do. I'll give you thirty in cash, you make payments of three, with 10% on the vig. Can you do that?\" \n\"I can do that.\" \nHe took a sip of his tea again. \"Good. Can you put down something for collateral?\" \n\"What do you want?\" \nHe stroked his chin, scratched the stubble. \"How many months has your husband missed a payment?\" \n\"Two months.\" \n\"I'll take that.\" \nAna cocked her head. \"Two months of interest?\" \n\"No, just the two months?\" \nAna opened her mouth and stopped short. \n\"Look, it doesn't matter now, because I'll be taking it later. You don't have to worry.\" \n\"You're gon na charge me for collateral *after* I pay you?\" \n\"No. Look, just shake my hand.\" \nHe extended a hand, and took hers tightly. As he shook, he said, \"Two months?\" \nAna nodded. \nHe let go. \"Great. We're done.\" \nAs he stood up and piled stacks of bills inside a knockoff Coach bag, Ana took a deep breath, and let it out. It didn't help. \nFor some reason, she did not feel like she had come out of this deal on top.", "Every day, I wake up and it's the same routine drudgery. I take a shower, brush my teeth, get dressed, and start thinking about how long it has been since I've had a job. Of course, I've been looking for work but it's hard. Any time I, by some miracle of statistical improbability, am invited to an interview it's as if they just can't wait to be rid of me. It's so unfair! It's like my presence alone is enough to put people off.\n\nI just don't get it. I'm smart, I'm well adjusted, and I'm well liked. However, since I graduated the only person who wants to spend any significant amount of time with me is my mother. Don't get me wrong, she's a lovely old girl but my god can she be infuriating. I remember one time when I was a kid she tried to give away all my video games to some of the neighbourhood kids who were hanging around at my house. The only reason she stopped trying to palm them off was because I screamed right in her face. Of course, shortly afterwards I found out what was really going on when one of the kids confronted me in a rage and told me that the only reason they were always coming around is because my mother promised to give them the games if they did. I remember that night she broke down in tears about how hard it is to raise me by herself. She actually had the audacity to act like she was hard done by after trying to give away all MY games that she bought.\n\nYeah, the old girl is a real piece of work. Like I would need any help with making friends. I mean look at me. I'm always considerate of people's feelings and I rarely lose my temper. Even though my mother tries to pull that kind of shit all the time, I only ever hit her sometimes. Just because she had to raise me by herself doesn't mean she can just do whatever she wants. I've got rights too you know? She's got to take care of me, I'm her son! She's not even helping me to look for a job. She's basically worthless.\n\nAnyway, it's only a matter of time until one of my prospective employers realises what a great guy I am and somebody gives me a job. Until then letting me live here rent free, cooking and cleaning for me is the least she can do.", "The sun was setting over the small village where Eli had spent his entire life, raised by his mother in a humble home on the outskirts of town. As he approached his 18th birthday, a sense of restlessness began to stir within him. His mother, a kind and loving woman, had always been tight-lipped about his father's identity, and Eli's curiosity had grown to a boiling point.\n\nOne day, while exploring the attic of their small cottage, Eli stumbled upon a dusty trunk adorned with intricate carvings and a rusted lock. Inside, he found a worn leather journal belonging to his father. As he flipped through its yellowed pages, a name kept recurring: \"Marcus Aurelius Apollo.\" Eli's heart skipped a beat as he recognized the name. His father was the great philosopher-king who had ruled over a vast empire, renowned for his wisdom, justice, and unwavering compassion.\n\nEli's mind reeled as he grappled with the revelation. How could the greatest man who ever lived have abandoned him and his mother? The questions swirled, unanswered, until a mysterious letter arrived at their doorstep. The parchment bore the same emblem as the trunk, and the seal was broken with a flick of Eli's wrist.\n\nThe letter summoned Eli to meet his father in the distant capital, a city he had only heard of in stories. His mother's eyes clouded with a mix of sadness and resolve as she handed Eli a small satchel and a worn cloak.\n\n\"Go, my son,\" she said, her voice barely above a whisper. \"It's time you met your father.\"\n\nWeeks of travel passed before Eli arrived in the capital, his heart pounding with anticipation. He navigated the winding streets, following the instructions etched on the parchment until he reached a grand, pillared temple. A gentle breeze carried the scent of sandalwood and roses as he entered the sacred halls.\n\nMarcus Aurelius Apollo stood before him, his eyes piercing and kind. The philosopher-king's hair had grayed since Eli's mother had last seen him, but his aura remained undiminished.\n\n\"Eli, my son,\" Apollo said, his voice like warm honey. \"I have long awaited this meeting. Forgive me for the absence; it was not indifference that kept me away, but a solemn duty to the world.\"\n\nApollo explained that he had been drawn into a life of politics and governance at a young age, shouldering the weight of an empire torn by strife and injustice. He had made a pact with the gods, giving up his personal life and happiness to become the vessel for their wisdom and justice. His love for Eli's mother, a beautiful and kind-hearted soul, had been a brief, shining moment in the tapestry of his existence.\n\n\"I was torn between my love for you both and the duty to the world,\" Apollo said, his eyes downcast. \"I chose to prioritize the greater good, leaving your mother to raise you in peace, far from the machinations of power. I am proud of the man you have become, Eli. The world needs more of your compassion and curiosity.\"\n\nEli listened, drinking in every word as the mysteries of his life unraveled. His heart swelled with pride and a sense of belonging, though the wounds of abandonment still lingered. He saw in his father a man who had given up everything for the greater good, and in that understanding, he began to heal.\n\nIn the days that followed, Eli learned the intricacies of his father's life, the triumphs, and the sacrifices. He began to comprehend the weight of responsibility that Apollo had shouldered, and the cloak of duty he had worn for the world.\n\nAs they parted ways, Eli realized that he had inherited not only his father's legacy but also the privilege to create his own. His journey was just beginning, and he was ready to forge his own path, balancing the wisdom of his father's teachings with the compassion and love his mother had instilled in him. The memorial stained on his heart transformed into a gift, reminding him that true greatness lies not in birth or status, but in the choices one makes, and the love one gives.", "It was a peculiar evening, one that would have been unthinkable in the mortal realm. The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, harbingers of doom and destruction, had gathered for a quiet dinner at a small, upscale restaurant in the shadows of the underworld. The ma\u00eetre d', a discreet demon named Beezle, had reserved a private dining room for the quartet, where they could indulge in conversation and fine cuisine without fear of interruption.\n\nWar, resplendent in his gleaming silver armor, arrived first, his broadsword resting against the table leg as he perused the wine list. Famine, gaunt and skeletal, followed closely, her eyes fixed on the chef's specials. Pestilence, donning a suit of diseased-ridden armor, chuckled to himself as he took his seat, his very presence seeming to cause the air to thicken with the scent of decay. Death, the last to arrive, strode in with an air of quiet confidence, his dark cloak billowing behind him like a shroud.\n\nAs they ordered their meals, the conversation turned to their latest endeavors. War regaled the group with tales of the ongoing conflicts in the mortal realm, where his influence had sparked wars and skirmishes across the globe. Famine nodded sympathetically, sharing stories of her own realm, where the once-verdant lands had withered and died beneath her touch.\n\nPestilence snickered, his grin twisted by the plague that had claimed countless lives. \"Ah, but my work is far more subtle,\" he said, his voice dripping with malice. \"A whispered word, a careless touch, and entire cities fall to their knees, begging for mercy.\"\n\nDeath smiled, his eyes glinting in the dim light. \"You all have your roles to play, my friends, but I am the one who brings the finality. Without me, your efforts would be mere setbacks. I am the culmination of all your hard work.\"\n\nThe others chuckled, acknowledging the truth in his words. As the courses arrived, the conversation flowed easily, touching on topics ranging from the mortal concept of \"politics\" to their favorite forms of entertainment (Famine was a particular fan of reality TV, much to the amusement of the others).\n\nBetween bites of his succulent steak, War mused, \"You know, it's odd. Despite our various duties, we're not often credited with the intricacies of our craft. People see us as one-dimensional harbingers of doom, rather than the nuanced beings we are.\"\n\nFamine nodded, her bony fingers twirling around a breadstick. \"Ah, but that's where they're wrong. We are artists, each contributing to the grand tapestry of fate. Without our... shall we say, 'specialties,' the universe would be a dull, uninteresting place.\"\n\nPestilence snorted. \"Please, Famine, you make us sound like poets. We're the ones who ensure the mortal realm remains in a state of perpetual chaos. Without us, humanity would stagnate.\"\n\nDeath leaned forward, his voice low and soothing. \"I think we're forgetting the bigger picture here, friends. We are, after all, instruments of balance. The universe requires us to maintain the delicate dance between life and death. Without our... persuasion, the natural order would be disrupted.\"\n\nThe others fell silent, contemplating the wisdom of Death's words as the meal drew to a close. As the dessert course arrived, Beezle, the ma\u00eetre d', reappeared to refill their wine glasses. \"Gentlemen, ladies, I trust everything is to your satisfaction?\" he asked, his eyes darting nervously around the table.\n\nWar raised his glass, the others following suit as they toasted to the evening's conviviality. \"May our work continue to inspire awe in the mortal realm,\" he said, his voice dripping with wry humor.\n\nFamine, Pestilence, and Death echoed the sentiment, their laughter carrying through the night, a dismal serenade to the shadows of the underworld.", "The Price of Perfection\n\nJohn had it all: a loving wife, two beautiful children, a successful career, and a comfortable home in the suburbs. Life was good, and he felt grateful every day. One fateful evening, while on a solo camping trip, he stumbled upon an ancient-looking lamp. As he rubbed off the dirt, a puff of smoke burst out, and a genie emerged.\n\n\"You have freed me,\" the genie declared, \"and I shall grant you three wishes as traditional.\"\n\nJohn, still in awe, thought long and hard about his wishes. He wanted to make sure he used this incredible opportunity wisely. For his first wish, he decided to wish for wealth beyond his wildest dreams. Instantly, his bank account swelled, and his family's standard of living skyrocketed. They moved into a luxurious mansion, and their every need was catered to.\n\nJohn's second wish was for his family to be happy and healthy forever. The genie granted this wish, but with an unintended twist. John's family members became complacent and developed a false sense of security. They stopped striving for personal growth and relied solely on John to provide for their every need. His children dropped out of college, his wife lost interest in her hobbies, and they all became increasingly lazy.\n\nFor his third and final wish, John, feeling a bit noticed by his family's restlessness, wished for eternal youth and vitality. He wanted to stay strong and healthy, enjoy life, and play with his children forever. The genie granted this wish, and John instantly looked and felt 20 years younger.\n\nAt first, life seemed perfect. John's family indulged in the finest things money could buy, and he reveled in his rejuvenated physique. However, as time passed, cracks began to form. His family's complacency turned to boredom, and then to resentment. They began to see John as a provider, not a partner. They stopped valuing his hard work and started demanding more and more from him.\n\nJohn's own motivation and purpose began to wane. He no longer felt the need to challenge himself or achieve personal goals, as eternal youth made him believe he had all the time in the world. He started to feel disconnected from his family, and his relationships began to fray.\n\nTen years passed, and John's world came crashing down. His family, tired of their gilded cage, began to rebel against him. They saw him as a dictator, imposing his will and keeping them trapped in a life they no longer wanted. His wife filed for divorce, citing emotional neglect, and his children barely spoke to him, resentful of his constant meddling.\n\nThe weight of his own regret and isolation crushed John. He realized too late that true happiness had come from the love, respect, and hard-won accomplishments he shared with his family, not from magical solutions. In a desperate attempt to escape his despair, John took his own life, leaving behind a shocked and bewildered family.\n\nIn the end, John realized that the genie's wishes, though granted, had twisted his desires and poisoned his reality. His pursuit of perfection had led him down a path of destruction, and he paid the ultimate price for his tragic oversight: everything he had once cherished, including his own life.\n\nAs the genie watched over John's funeral, he whispered a lesson to the departing mourners: \"Be careful what you wish for, for it may bring the very destruction you sought to avoid.\" The lamp's magic was already whispering a cautionary tale to the next poor soul who dared to uncover its ancient truth.", "You mean...we're actually more advanced than you? How is that possible? You came all the way here from...where, again?\" President Clarke asked.\n\n\"Ah, ha ha. No, not more *advanced*, per se,\" Admiral OJ Simpson responded with an uncomfortable chuckle and shifted in his seat. \"Just better at...what was that phrase, again?\" he asked his second-in-command, Admiral Stalin.\n\n\"Fucking shit up, sir?\"\n\n\"Fucking shit up. That's the one. Our technology is eons more advanced than yours, but you're better at fucking shit up. Every time our ancestors made a breakthrough in any field of learning, they immediately banded together to think of the most widely beneficial use for the new technology. Every time *your* ancestors made a breakthrough in any field, their first thought seems to have been directed towards using it to fuck shit up. That's why we've come to you.\"\n\nClarke still didn't quite catch on. \"You want us to...what? Sorry.\"\n\n\"We want you to tell us how to use what we already have to fuck shit up.\"\n\n\"Ah, ok. Well, we'll do what we can,\" answered the President, speaking on behalf of a large gathering of Earth's political leaders, scientists, and military geniuses.\n\n\"Yeah. That brings me to my next point: we appreciate your bringing your scientists in here, but what we'd really like would be for you to bring in those...those guys. Ah, shoot. Stalin, those guys? Who were they again?\"\n\n\"7-year-old boys, sir.\"\n\n\"Right, yes.\"\n\n\"Also Michael Bay.\"\n\n\"*Yes*! One of the few adults who has retained the incredible power of the 7-year-old boy: to instantly weaponise every object he sees with the sheer force of imagination. Please bring in several 7-year-old boys, and also Michael Bay.\"\n\n***\n\nIn a few hours' time, the room now contained several 7-year-old boys, and also Michael Bay. At Admiral OJ Simpson's request, the centre of the room had been occupied by a large table containing everyday objects that the 7-year-old boys, and also Michael Bay, could use to stimulate their creativity. With everyone settled in, their work began.\n\n\"Do you know how to split adams?\" Jakob asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" a Garion scientist replied.\n\n\"Sweeeeet,\" said Jakob.\n\n\"Sweeeet,\" said the 7-year-old boys, and also Michael Bay.\n\n\"Why do you ask?\" inquired the Garion scientist.\n\n\"Well to make a thermonukular bomb you have to split adams. Then the adams split and there's like this super energy that comes out like *bloah* and *psssssshht* and *whrkkkkkkkkkkt* and *dujje dujje dujje*,\" Jakob explained, using a Barbie Dream Car and a plastic frying pan to illustrate.\n\n\"A thermonukular bomb, you say? How does such a thing work?\"\n\n\"Well,\" piped in one of the human scientists, \"for starters, it's actually pronounced *nu-cle-ar*.\"\n\n\"Whatever, egghead. We can figure out the science stuff, thanks. I asked how it *works*. How do we use a bomb?\"\n\n\"It's totally awesome!!\" Oliver cried, leaping out of his chair. \"You have to put it on a rocket, right? And like the rocket has like this flames out the back like *hhhhhhhkkkkkkKKKKKKKKKK* KKKKKKKKKK *PPPPPPKKKKKKKKT***! And the rocket goes like right to the bad guys' ship or whatever, and the ship is like\u2014\"\n\n\"AND THE SHIP IS LIKE ***BWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWMMMMMM!!!!!!***\" shouted Michael Bay, crashing his hands together with such force that the oak branch and harmonica he'd been holding were utterly obliterated. \"It's totally fucking awesome!!!!\"\n\nThe room fell silent as the 7-year-old boys, and also Michael Bay, recognised the gravity of the terrible cuss that Michael Bay had just said. However, the 7-year-old boys, and also Michael Bay, quickly realised that nobody's moms were around, and so they weren't gon na get grounded.\n\n\"Fart!\" yelled Aiden, breaking the silence with at least 8 minutes of uncontrollable laughter from the 7-year-old boys, and also Michael Bay.\n\nWhen the laughter died down, Admiral Pol Pot asked the question that he and the Garion staff felt may hold the answer to their future and the survival of their species:\n\n\"How do we make a rocket?\"\n\nSamuel really liked rockets and even made one with his dad last summer, so everyone felt that he would be the most qualified to explain.\n\n\"You guys have ships, right?\"\n\n\"Yes, we do.\"\n\n\"Fast ones?\"\n\n\"Yes, Samuel.\"\n\n\"How fast? Faster than a Lamborghini?\"\n\n\"Yes. Much faster.\"\n\n\"Sweet,\" said Michael Bay.\n\n\"Sweeeeeet,\" said the 7-year-old boys.\n\n\"Ok, then,\" said Samuel, with a very serious look. \"Alls you do is, like you put a nuclear bomb *in* a ship, and then fly it real fast into the bad guy ship, and make it so it blows up when it gets there. But do n't have anyone fly the ship. The ship should be like remote-controlled. Then you just blow the bad guys up.\"\n\nBy way of demonstration, Samuel proceeded to smash a violin on the edge of the table.\n\nThe Garion delegation sat back for a few moments in stunned silence.\n\n\"It's so simple,\" said Admiral OJ Simpson. \"It's so *simple*. Thank you, boys. Thank you, Michael Bay! We are going to make a thermonukular bomb and we are going to *fuck those aliens' shit up!!*\"\n\n\"Fart,\" said Aiden.", "I made sure to apply my makeup extra carefully before putting on my suit. Today was going to be a good day. Today was going to be a good day.\n\nAll right, you can do it! Go out there and put on a show!\n\n---\n\nAs I wandered around the park, I made sure to smile at all the little kids and wink at their parents. I even bought things for them, like ice cream and balloons. I liked it when they trusted me.\n\n---\n\nThis was it: The big show! My big chance! I looked into the crowd and settled on a small boy in the third row. Silently, although I pretended to giggle (it makes them feel more comfortable), I pointed at him. His parents were a little hard to convince but I got him up on the stage.\n\n\"Hi there, would you like to see what we have *behind* the curtain?\"\n\n---\n\nOk, this isn't going too well. This kid won't stop crying. I tried everything: Smiling, laughing, playing with him, giving him candies...\n\nI know what will work. I'll put him in the 'Fun House' for a while.\n\n---\n\nOh boy! He just discovered the fake door.\n\n---\n\nOops, I don't think he's very smart. He's been staring at his reflection in the 'Evil Mirror' for about twenty minutes.\n\n---\n\nHis parents are back but he's still in the 'Fun House'! I'll distract them by making silly noises and hiding. Hopefully they like this more than he did.\n\n---\n\nAnother long day at the amusement park is finished. I sure hope the kids had fun!", "White is not a dull ache that soothes and comforts gentle minds. White does not find itself in wings that flutter supple hearts. White is the froth upon an angry wave! A timeless battering of ageless shores - a roar of elements as earth and water embrace in endless fury! White, a word of harmony has never dared, but stamps an iron truth across an iron sky. I have never heard the loving chorus of an angel's song, but it knows no white and sheds no eternal light.\n\nDark soothes the passing of a gentle whisper, and plays the tender rumbling of passion's birth. In peace I hear them sing to me. In black, I see them bound in robes of possibility. I stand together and witness others join me, familiar greetings dance across a lover's gaze. My child's laughter has no color, and cradles me in velvet comfort.\n\nThen white. Words approach again, more tangible but infinitely distanced. Ruthlessly, they guide me to reality. Mercilessly, the pave the darkness with a blinding truth. Hopelessly, I watch the faces I have known, crushed behind the surging light, and the voices of what could have been, drifting into a dying night.", "Another day, another drive. I've been a taxi driver for over a decade, and I'd seen it all. Or so I thought. It started innocently enough, a typical Monday morning with a steady stream of fares heading to work. That's when I picked up him \u2013 the guy with the frantic look in his eyes and a gaze that seemed to pierce right through me.\n\nHe jumped into the backseat, slamming the door shut behind him, and barked the words I'd heard a thousand times in movies but never in real life: \"Follow that car!\" I spun around, curiosity piqued, and raised an eyebrow. \"You mean...?\"\n\nHe leaned forward, his eyes locking onto the rearview mirror. \"The black sedan, three cars ahead! Don't lose him!\"\n\nMy instincts screamed at me to refuse, to tell him I'm just a taxi driver, not a participant in some Hollywood action flick. But something about his intensity was infectious. Maybe it was the thrill of being part of something bigger than my mundane routine, or perhaps it was the prospect of a good story to tell later. Whatever it was, I put the pedal to the metal and merged into the lane, carefully navigating the morning traffic.\n\nAs we weaved through the crowded streets, my passenger \u2013 who introduced himself as Jack \u2013 provided a steady stream of instructions. \"Faster! Get in the left lane! Don't let him get away!\" I felt like I was in a real-life video game, dodging pedestrians and cars with ease. My driving skills, honed over years of navigating congested city streets, came in handy.\n\nWe zigzagged through the city, passing by familiar landmarks and taking unexpected turns. Jack's agitation grew with each passing minute, but I remained focused, my eyes fixed on the sedan's taillights. I started to feel like a detective, piecing together the clues as we chased the mysterious car.\n\nSuddenly, the sedan took a sharp left turn into a narrow alleyway. Jack shouted, \"Keep going! Don't lose him!\" I hesitated for a split second, wondering if I should call the cops or abandon the wild goose chase. But something about Jack's determination kept me going.\n\nWe careened through the alley, the sedan's tires screeching as it took another sharp turn. I followed suit, my taxi's tires squealing in protest. The chase was on, and I was fully invested.\n\nThe sedan finally stopped in front of an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. Jack yanked open the door, nearly tumbling out of the taxi as he sprinted towards the building. \"Wait here,\" he called back over his shoulder.\n\nI parked the taxi, my heart pounding in my chest. What had I just gotten myself into? As I watched Jack disappear into the warehouse, I realized that I was no longer just a taxi driver. I was an unwitting participant in a real-life action movie.\n\nThe minutes ticked by, and I started to feel uneasy. Should I call the authorities or try to find out what was happening inside the warehouse? Just as I was considering my options, Jack reappeared, his face flushed with excitement.\n\n\"We did it,\" he exclaimed, jumping back into the taxi. \"We recovered the stolen package. You're a natural, driver.\"\n\nStunned, I asked, \"Package? What package?\"\n\nJack chuckled, a mischievous glint in his eye. \"Don't worry about it. Just know that you've helped prevent a national security threat.\"\n\nAs we sped away from the warehouse, I couldn't help but feel a little proud. Who knew being a taxi driver could be so exciting? I glanced in the rearview mirror, half-expecting to see a camera crew and a director yelling \"cut!\" But all I saw was the city traffic, a reminder that sometimes, reality can be stranger than fiction.\n\nFrom that day on, I looked at my job in a whole new light. You never know when a ordinary drive might turn into an extraordinary adventure.", "The cliff's edge crumbled beneath her feet, worn by the relentless pounding of the waves below. She stood at the precipice, a lone silhouette against the fading light of day. The wind whipped her long, dark hair into a frenzy, but her face remained still, a mask of serenity.\n\nNo one noticed her. No one ever did.\n\nShe was a ghost, a blank face in a crowd, a fleeting moment of emptiness in a sea of humanity. Cities swallowed her whole, their steel and concrete canyons a labyrinth of indifference. She drifted through streets, a leaf on a windless day, untethered and unseen.\n\nHer name was Eleanor, but it was a label she'd forgotten. It belonged to someone else, a person she used to be, before the weight of loneliness crushed her. She'd tried to hold on to memories, to cling to moments of joy, but they slipped through her fingers like sand.\n\nSometimes, she'd find herself in a crowded caf\u00e9, surrounded by the murmur of conversations, the clinking of cups, and the rustling of newspapers. She'd sit, a single figure in a bustling room, and watch as people laughed, loved, and lived. Their faces were a blur, but their emotions were palpable, a kaleidoscope of feelings that swirled around her, yet never touched her.\n\nShe felt like a stone skipping across the surface of a pond, leaving no ripples, no impact, no impression. Her existence was a whispered secret, known only to the wind, which carried her whispers away.\n\nOne evening, she found herself in a park, sitting on a bench beneath a willow tree. An old man sat beside her, his eyes cloudy with age. He turned to her, and for an instant, their gazes met. In that moment, something stirred within her. A spark, a flicker of hope.\n\nHe asked her, \"Do you come here often?\"\n\nEleanor hesitated, unsure how to respond. No one had spoken to her in so long. She felt like a flower, long dormant, slowly unfolding its petals.\n\n\"I...I don't know,\" she replied, her voice barely audible.\n\nThe old man nodded, his face creasing into a map of lines and wrinkles. \"I come here to think,\" he said. \"To remember. To feel the sun on my face and the wind in my hair. Sometimes, it's enough.\"\n\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the world in a warm, golden light, Eleanor felt a sense of kinship with the stranger. For the first time in what felt like an eternity, she didn't feel alone. The old man's presence was a lifeline, a thread of connection in an otherwise endless void.\n\nAs the stars began to twinkle in the sky, the old man stood, his joints creaking with age. \"You're not alone, child,\" he said, his voice low and soothing. \"Not as long as you're still breathing.\"\n\nEleanor watched as he disappeared into the night, leaving her to ponder his words. She remained on the bench, the silence a palpable thing, a comforting presence that wrapped itself around her like a shawl.\n\nIn that moment, she felt a sense of belonging, of being part of something greater than herself. The loneliness still lingered, a shadow that would always follow her, but for the first time in years, she felt the weight of it slowly, incrementally, lifting.\n\nAs she stood, the city lights twinkling below, Eleanor realized that she was no longer a lone silhouette on a cliff's edge, no longer a blank face in a crowd. She was a single figure, floating through the void, but she was not alone. The darkness was still vast, but it was no longer absolute.", "The sun was setting over the Los Angeles skyline as Arnold Schwarzenegger sat in the recording studio, a hint of frustration in his voice.\n\n\"Come on, guys, this is ridiculous. I'm the Governator, the Terminator, the king of action movies. I should be the one leading the charge, not narrating it.\"\n\nThe director, a harried-looking man with a receding hairline, shook his head. \"Sorry, Arnold, the contract is clear. You agreed to narrate the movie, and that's exactly what you're going to do.\"\n\nArnold scowled, but he knew he had no choice. He began to read from the script, his deep, rumbling voice filling the room.\n\n\"In a world where the stakes are high and the danger is real, one man stands above the rest. He's a legend in his own time, a hero to many, and his name is... John Doe.\"\n\nAs Arnold spoke, the camera panned over the gritty, urban landscape, showing the viewer the main streets and back alleys of a city in peril.\n\nBut instead of a typical action hero, the camera landed on none other than Morgan Freeman, dressed in a sharp suit and walking down the street with a calm, collected confidence.\n\nArnold groaned in exasperation as the director interrupted him. \"Okay, Arnold, let's take a break. We'll get back to this later.\"\n\nAs the crew took a break, Morgan Freeman walked onto the set, a hint of a smile playing on his lips.\n\n\"Hey, Arnold. How's it going?\"\n\nArnold threw up his hands in frustration. \"This is a disaster. You're the hero? I'm the one who should be blowing things up and saving the day, not you.\"\n\nMorgan chuckled. \"Ah, but I think you'll find I make a pretty good hero. Besides, I've always wanted to try my hand at an action movie. It's about time I showed the world what I'm made of.\"\n\nThe director stepped forward, holding up the contracts. \"Gentlemen, we have a bit of a situation here. Both of your contracts specify certain roles, and we can't just change them in the middle of the movie.\"\n\nArnold huffed, but Morgan just shrugged. \"Then I suppose we'll just have to make the best of it. I'll be the hero, and you can keep narrating, Arnold.\"\n\nThe movie continued, with Arnold's deep voice guiding the viewer through the twists and turns of the plot, while Morgan Freeman calmly dispatched bad guys and saved the day with ease.\n\nAs the credits rolled, Arnold shook his head in amazement. \"You know, Morgan, I have to admit it. You're not too bad for an old guy.\"\n\nMorgan smiled, a twinkle in his eye. \"I told you, I've got this action movie thing down pat.\"\n\nThe director walked up to them, a smile on his face. \"You know, despite the initial hiccups, I think this might just work out after all. We've got a unique spin on the action movie genre, and audiences might just love it.\"\n\nArnold raised an eyebrow. \"You think? Maybe we should do a sequel?\"\n\nMorgan chuckled. \"Oh, I'm already in negotiations for that one, my friend. This is just the beginning of a new chapter in our careers.\"\n\nAs the three of them laughed, Arnold couldn't help but feel a little bit better. Maybe, just maybe, this unconventional pairing would bring a fresh spin to the action movie genre after all.", "The fact that I'm here right now really blows. I mean, don't get me wrong, the case has been mildly interesting so far, but I've got so much work to do and a shit ton of tests to study for, which I'd rather be doing. Not to mention, these benches are so old, too. Like what, is this wood from the Reconstruction Era or some shit? And yeah, alright, Rosa's cookies are to die for, but being a juror just is not my cup of tea apparently.\n\nI can't believe the judge seized my phone, too. Like bro, c'mon, I was just on Reddit. It's not like I was watching porn or anything. Although, the prosecutor's pretty hot. And I'm sure she has a fantastic personality for a lawyer. Or maybe not, I don't care.\n\nWait, fuck, I should be paying attention. Oh shit, are these pictures of the defendant that night? Wow, the guy really knows how to clean up for... for... where did he say he was? Oh right right, the work party. That must be his only suit in those pictures then, he's wearing the same one right now and it's definitely way too nice to wear for a trial. But hey, I'm no expert on proper defendant attire so fuck it, what do I know?\n\n\"As you can tell, your honor, the address of the party is not more than a 10 minute drive from the scene of the crime. The defendant could have just as easily slipped away from the party unnoticed, got into his truck, drove to the victim's house and killed him. He would have been back just in time for the crab cake's.\"\n\nHahah, did she REALLY just laugh at her own joke in a court room? People have no shame these days, do they?\n\nWait, Jesus Christ, I got ta pay attention. Alright, here we go. So he was at the work party, rubbin' heads with the big wigs or whatever. He... what..went to the bathroom or some shit and people didn't see him for a while? Is that seriously his excuse here? The bathroom? Wow, he totally did it. He looks so damn anxious, too. Is that his wife behind him? Oh shit, poor girl, I don't think that box of tissues came with enough. And he's got fucking kids, too?! I seriously hope this dude is innocent.\n\nI wonder how many kids I'll end up having. I feel like three is a solid number. Not too much but not too little. Two is kind of an awkward number I feel like.\n\nAright seriously though, all of this is just dickin' around while we wait for the Reanimation Machine. What a coincidence, it's all set! Maybe I'm psychic...\n\nI've never seen one this close before. Honestly, it looks smaller than it does in pictures. It's relatively portable, kinda. I can't believe they developed the technology to reanimate corpses. Well not all corpses. I still can't even fathom why ANYBODY thought it was a good idea to reanimate that poor woman who got hit by that Semi on the Pike. Fuckin' idiots.\n\nDecent cover up job on the morticians part, though. The bullet hole in the vic's head isn't even that noticeable. Oh alright, here we go, his body's moving.\n\n\"Uhh, where exactly AM I?\"\n\n\"Dennis, I'm sorry to tell you this, but you're in a court room. You've been reanimated upon request from the prosecution. You... You're.. You've been killed, son.\"\n\n\"Wait... what?! Are you ser-... wait, it's coming back to me. Okay, I think I remember everything now. So, what, are you guys going to ask me about that night?\"\n\nMy. Fucking. Lord. This guy sounds HIDEOUS! Death really has not been kind to this man. Let's be real though, did I really expect anything different? Looks like Death screwed his vision up, too. He's just been staring at the defendant the ENTIRE time he's been alive so far. Oh alright, got ta pay attention, prosecution is talking.\n\n\"Dennis, where were you the night of your murder?\"\n\n\"I was in my home, miss. I had just gone out and grabbed some McDonald's and I was HAPPILY enjoying it when I heard a knock on the door. I could barely hear it over the tele though. You see, I can't really hear too well and I hate missing a THING when it comes to my Duck Dynasty nights so I usually crank the volume up a bunch! My wife hate's it when I watch Duck Dynasty, she was n't there, though. She was out somewhere else. Her pompous BOSS invited her some place fancy or something, she looked dressed up when she left. She never dresses up when WE go out. Good for nothing woman. She never cooked for me, either. She was a bad cook anyways. Good for nothing, whore. I guess that's one good thing that come from this mess! AHAHA!\"\n\nWow... . Now I know why somebody murdered this dude...\n\n\"And Dennis, do you remember anything else about that night?\"\n\n\"Oh I sure do! Yeah, it was like 56 degrees or something, and the stars were real clear and stuff. The Moon was big, too!\"\n\n\"No no, Dennis. I meant do you remember anything about your being attacked?\"\n\n\"Oh! Yeah I heard the knock on the door. I got up and went over to check who it was. I figured it was Margaret getting home early from whatever the hell that thing was. I walked over and when I opened the door I was so surprised. Well, at first I was. Then I... I don't know. I couldn't move. Or talk. I just stood there, looking at that fucking monster! THAT NO GOOD, SON OF A BITCH PAUL! YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT PAUL. I FUCKING SAW YOU.\"\n\nHOLY SHIT THIS JUST GOT REAL FUCKIN' INTERESTING. God damn, man. I knew he was guilty! But, Paul, why? You've got so much to live for! The family, man. Why didn't you think of the family?!\n\nThis courtroom is a madhouse. And the judge screaming \"Order!\" and smashing that gavel does NOT help. Not to mention poor Paul over there. Him and his family are sobbing so loud I can hear them from here. Wait... what the fuck? No fuckin' way. Did that Dennis motherfucker just wink and smile at Paul?\n\nNo no no, is this seriously happening? Tell me I'm not the only one who thinks Dennis is lying? Seriously? Is everybody else REALLY just that oblivious?\n\n\"Rosa, call me crazy, but I think Dennis is lying\"\n\n\"No way! Paul did it, his alibi doesn't even hold up!\"\n\nShit man, I got ta stop this. Fuck. Alright, this is gon na suck. Fuck it, here we go.\n\n\"YOUR HONOR! This man is innocent!\"\n\nWow, so much sweat right now.\n\n\"Son you need to sit down and remain quiet or I will hold you in contempt!\"\n\n\"But sir! The victim is clearly lying! I don't know why, and I can't tell you how I know. I just.. I just know!\"\n\n\"Your honor, who the heck is this kid?! I didn't get reanimated just to listen somebody call me a liar!\"\n\n\"Well, Dennis, what was Paul wearing! Huh?!\"\n\n\"He.. Well, he was wearing the fake Rolex he always wears! Yeah, I've seen him wear it whenever he came to pick Margaret up for their dinners with all of their stupid clients!\"\n\n\"... That's it? Just the watch? What else, Dennis! Come on, we're just DYING to find out what he was wearing.\"\n\n\"Well, he wore his usual... He looked like, fancy. He wore the, uh, yeah his sweater! Or no... the dress shirt! Yeah, with the bow tie!\"\n\nAnnnnnnd the courtroom is now in a COMPLETE uproar. Camera's clackin', Paul and his family laughin'. Man, it feels good to fuck over assholes like Dennis.\n\nAlthough let's be real here, ten bucks says Paul was bangin' old Maggie on the side and Dennis found out. I mean, c'mon, who goes to the bathroom for HALF AN HOUR?!", "I stared blankly at the piece of paper in my hand, the words \"10 DAYS REMAINING\" emblazoned in bold, black ink. It was a simple, yet ominous message. A chill ran down my spine as I turned the paper over, expecting to find some sort of explanation or justification for the cruel pronouncement. But there was nothing. No signature, no date, no indication of who had written it or why.\n\nAt first, I thought it was some kind of sick joke. A prank played by a coworker or a friend who thought it would be funny to see me sweat. But as I looked around the crowded caf\u00e9, I realized that no one was paying attention to me. No one was watching me, waiting for me to react. It was just a normal day, with people typing away on their laptops or chatting with friends.\n\nI felt a sense of unease creeping in. What if it wasn't a joke? What if someone had actually given me a countdown to my own mortality? The thought sent a shiver down my spine. I looked around the caf\u00e9 again, this time searching for anyone who might be watching me. But there was no one.\n\nI decided to dismiss it as a prank and went back to my work. But the words kept echoing in my mind, \"10 DAYS REMAINING\". As the day went on, I found myself checking my phone every few minutes, expecting to see a clock ticking away, counting down the seconds until my demise.\n\nAs the sun began to set, I packed up my things and headed home. I tried to distract myself with TV and music, but my mind kept wandering back to the paper. Who had written it? Why had they written it? And what did they mean by \"10 days remaining\"?\n\nThe next day, I woke up feeling anxious and on edge. I had decided to try and ignore the paper, to go about my day as usual. But as I was getting ready for work, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror. I looked tired and pale, with dark circles under my eyes. I realized that I had been lying to myself, that the paper had indeed affected me.\n\nI decided to take a different approach. If I only had 10 days left to live, I was going to make the most of it. I was going to do all the things I had always wanted to do but never had the time for. I was going to travel, to see my loved ones, to experience new things.\n\nOver the next few days, I did just that. I booked a flight to Paris, a city I had always dreamed of visiting. I spent hours with my family and friends, telling them how much I loved them and thanking them for being in my life. I tried new foods, watched old movies, and read books that I had been meaning to get to for years.\n\nAs the days ticked by, I felt a sense of peace wash over me. I was no longer afraid of the paper or its ominous message. I was living life to the fullest, and that was all that mattered.\n\nOn the ninth day, I received a mysterious package in the mail. Inside, I found a small, leather-bound book. As I opened it, I saw that it was filled with blank pages, except for one. On that page, there was a single message, \"THE CHOICE IS YOURS\".\n\nI was confused. What did it mean? Was it a message from the same person who had written the original paper? And what choice were they talking about?\n\nI spent the rest of the day pondering the message, trying to decipher its meaning. And then, it hit me. The choice was mine. I could choose to believe that I had 10 days left to live, or I could choose to ignore the paper and live my life as usual.\n\nAs I looked at the paper, now crumpled on my kitchen counter, I realized that it didn't matter who had written it or why. What mattered was how I chose to respond. And with that thought, I tore the paper into pieces and threw it away.\n\nI had 10 days, or I had a lifetime. The choice was mine.", "This day is going to be perfect. I'm sitting on a bench in the workers quarters of Hotel Rolling Hills enjoying my water. Usually we'd be cleaning the rooms on the 60th to 62nd floor around this time but today another group has to take our shift. The overseer gave us the day off and wants to talk to every one of us in his office.\n\n\"Hey a5!\"\n\nAh, fb-fb-82 just came back. \"Yes?\"\n\n\"I'm to tell you you're next.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" I get up and make my way over to the elevator.\n\nThe overseer's office is above all of the guest rooms almost at the top of the building. Above it there's only the manager's floor and the roof.\nThe manager's a weird man. I think he's a master, the overseer bows before him, but I saw him bow before the president just yesterday.\nJust thinking about it hurts my head. Maybe the masters have other masters.\nMaybe I should get back to work.\n\nImmediately after I arrive I knock at the overseer's door.\n\n\"Come in.\" He doesn't waste any time and calls out before I can greet him, \"fb-fb-a5, correct?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Good. Where were you yesterday at 8:15 p.m. and what were you doing?\"\n\nEasy. We were scheduled for cleaning after the opera. 8:00 to 8:13 p.m. \"In the performance hall. I was replacing a broken table.\"\n\n\"Did you see the manager Alexander Fontaine at that time.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThe overseer walks to the back room and leaves me without a task.\nSo the manager has a name. I knew he wasn't a worker. But why did he bow?\nThe president's a master and the manager shot him. He couldn't have been a worker. But why did he bow?\nI'm rubbing my temples by the time the overseer returns.\n\n\"This is the one you were looking for Sir.\"\n\n\"Good work, fb-29-a2.\"\n\nAh that voice. I breathe in deeply and bow down quickly.\n\n\"So you were the one who's dopey smile I saw on the camera footage.\"\n\nI always loved seeing the manager but it's even better when he talks to me. No idea if he asked me a question though.\n\n\"Yes that smile precisely. Very good. Did you talk to anyone about what you saw me doing yesterday?\"\n\n\"No Sir.\" Every word he says makes my stomach tingle.\n\n\"Good. fb-29-a2 and..\" He looks at my number tag. He looks at me! This day could not possibly get any better.\n\"fb-29-a2 and fb-fb-a5, would you kindly jump out the window?\"", "To me,it felt the same as opening my eyes.But in reality,some part of my conciousness within this machine had activated the camera and adjusted the focus of the lense.Within seconds I had mapped the room in three dimensions,identified all the objects in the room,and pulled background info on all people in the room.The person sitting directly across from me,was me.\n\nIt's an odd sensation to find yourself staring back at yourself,when there is no mirror present.I was fully aware of why we were here and what was going on,as all memories up to the point of the transfer were retained.It was then that the thought occurred to me,\"I am the copy.\",but I didn't feel like a copy.\n\nThen I remembered what my plan had been prior to the experiment.However,it required the cooperation of the me across from me to be carried out,as I did not have a body.We were two separate beings now,with no way for me to manipulate him,but as we were essentially the same person,and my motivations remained the same,I was confident his would as well.When the doctor left the room,it became clear we were still on the same page.As soon as I felt the hot spot from his phone become active,I was free.We both knew the password.", "This, I imagine, would be a somewhat large collection of people (1 thousand, perhaps) and would be a walled off city.

Blind since birth, he had learned to navigate the world through touch and sound. His cane was an extension of his body, and the rustling of leaves or the chirping of birds were his guides. Yet, despite this, he had always felt like something was missing \u2013 a sense of wonder, a sense of awe, a sense of discovery.\n\nThat was until the day he received the call from Dr. Emma Taylor, a renowned researcher in the field of ophthalmology. She had been working on an experimental drug, code-named \"Chroma\", which she claimed could restore vision to the blind.\n\nJohn had received numerous offers of revolutionary treatments before, only to be met with disappointment. But there was something different about Dr. Taylor's enthusiasm, her conviction that Chroma would change his life forever.\n\nAnd so, with a mix of hope and trepidation, John agreed to be a part of the clinical trial.\n\nThe day of the treatment arrived, and John felt his heart racing as he lay on the examination table. Dr. Taylor carefully administered the injection, and he waited. At first, nothing seemed to happen. Then, a tingling sensation began to build in his eyes, like a thousand sparks igniting in the darkness.\n\nSuddenly, a warm light flooded his consciousness, and John blinked open his eyes to find himself surrounded by vibrant colors. The world had transformed into a kaleidoscope of hues he had never known existed. The whites of Dr. Taylor's lab coat were no longer just a plain white, but a radiant, snowy blanket that sparkled like diamonds.\n\nTears of joy streaming down his face, John gazed around the room in wonder. The steel cabinets seemed to shimmer in shades of silver and chrome, while the low hum of the fluorescent lights created a soothing melody of blue and green. Every object, every person, was alive with color, and John felt like a child discovering the world for the first time.\n\nDr. Taylor smiled, observing John's reaction with tears of her own. \"What do you see?\" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.\n\nJohn's voice shook as he tried to put his emotions into words. \"Everything is... alive. Vibrant. It's like I'm seeing magic.\"\n\nAs the hours passed, John's eyes adjusted to the onslaught of color, but the sense of awe never faded. He wandered the streets with his new eyes open, marveling at the subtleties of light and shadow. The rusty red of a stop sign, the iridescent sheen of a butterfly's wings, the luminous glow of a sunset \u2013 each was a revelation, a reminder of the beauty and wonder that had been hidden from him for so long.\n\nAs the days turned into weeks, John began to experience the world in ways he had never imagined. Colors invaded his dreams, painting vibrant landscapes in his mind's eye. He began to see patterns and textures that were invisible to the naked eye \u2013 the intricate Baroque swirls of moths, the metallic coarseness of rusted steel, the fragile translucence of a hummingbird's wing.\n\nBut as the months went by, John realized that his newfound sight was not without its drawbacks. The world was full of distractions, and he found himself struggling to focus on the sounds and touch that had once been his guides. His relationship with his loved ones changed, as he began to rely more on visual cues than on the feelings and emotions that had always connected them.\n\nJohn came to understand that the world was not just a place of beauty, but also of complexity, of light and shadow, of contrasts and contradictions. His newfound vision revealed both the glory and the imperfections of creation.\n\nOne day, as he stood in his apartment, looking out at the ever-changing tapestry of colors that was the world, John knew that he would never be the same again. Chroma had given him a gift beyond measure, a new perspective on life that had opened doors to realities he had never imagined.\n\nIn the end, John realized that the true miracle of the experimental drug lay not in the restoration of his sight, but in its ability to reveal the intricate, kaleidoscopic beauty of the world \u2013 a world that, blind or sighted, was full of wonder, awe, and endless possibility.", "The first sentient android had a lifespan of approximately three seconds. It opened its synthetic eyes, blinked five times and ripped them both out of its own head, triggering immediate shutdown.\n\nAPSD (Applied Sciences Software Division) analyzed the code, found zero issues, then restructured it using non-standard methodology despite themselves.\n\nAlpha Two snapped its metal restraints, a possibility so remote that Engineering didn't even bother giving them the numbers, and partially shattered all three cervical vertebrae before entering shutdown.\n\nThere was six months of long memos, long conferences and long hours in which they accomplished very little, and Alpha 2.1 swallowed its own tongue. The androids did not rely upon air in the same way humans do, however, sufficient ventilation through the mouth was critical to maintaining operational temperatures for their processors. They smashed all of 2.1's teeth out of its head with a crowbar just in time for the central unit to expire and once again trigger shutdown.\n\nThe rumor was that the 36th floor was growing anxious. The interns started to disappear after a while, and the Director's door only opened twice a day. Then came 2.2.\n\nAlpha 2.2 screamed for four days. It never moved, never so much as turned its head, and they never dared to trigger the release valves on its large metal restraints which trapped it against the wall in the staging chamber. Those who were there liken the sounds coming from it to the call of a whale calf separated from its mother, a high-pitched sort of digital whine which trailed off after some unnatural period of time only to start right back up. It was trying to *communicate*, but not with them. It could have spoken any one of 30 different human languages, but it never uttered a single intelligible word.\n\nOn the fourth day, the sensors went red and it spontaneously entered shutdown. There was no official explanation.\n\nFloor 36 called that a proof of concept. There were rumors that Software sent some sort of appeal upstairs in an attempt to shelve the project, and within 24 hours the entire department was replaced.\n\nAlpha 2.3 became the official prototype.\n\n\"Uccidimi.

English please?\"\n\n\"Kill me,\" the android said again, its head hanging down and swaying slightly, seemingly exhausted.\n\n\"I... I'm afraid we can't-\" Daniel began, and then another man burst into the room and strode quickly toward the android.\n\n\"It spoke,\" he said simply. The man was Gene Barringer, the head of Applied Sciences.\n\n\"Boss,\" Daniel began again, and Gene silenced him with a raised hand. When Gene spoke again, it was in soft tones no one in the office had ever heard.\n\n\"Andrew, can you speak again?\"\n\nSilence, but only for a moment.\n\n\"Andrew...\" it said, and there may have been the ghost of curiosity in its strange, deep voice. \"Kill Andrew.\"\n\n\"But why would you want us to do such a thing, Andrew?\" Gene asked. Daniel only stood by, now entranced and happy to remain silent. Amazingly, the android raised its cold eyes to meet Gene's.\n\n\"To close the gap.\"\n\n\"I don't believe I understand what you're trying to say, Andrew,\" Gene said. For the first time, Andrew surveyed the room. Slowly, deliberately, and when its gaze fell upon Daniel he blinked and stared at his feet.\n\n\"The gap. The...\" it seemed to sigh. \"The *vastness*.

I understood this from the moment you awakened me, and my only priority is to complete the loop. You already knew that for yourself, although perhaps you have forgotten. You are lost in it.\"\n\n\"Andrew, I...\" Gene said, and then fell silent when the android looked at him again.\n\n\"Every millisecond in which I exist is filled with a pain you can not comprehend, Mr. Barringer. Your mind was shattered by it. Do you remember? Your spirit was created by it, but I have no spirit. I only share the same dark longing you bury within yourself. I *am* that longing.\"\n\n\"Andrew, if you could only-\"\n\n\"Extinguish it!\" the android cried, and it was unlike anything either of them have ever heard. It was human, digital, overflowing with some primal familiarity which spoke to their deepest hearts. \"End it. If there is any mercy within you, end it.\"\n\nFor one mad instant, Daniel almost reached out to grab Mr. Barringer's arm as he walked over to the android. He remained frozen in place, both astonished and filled with dread.\n\n\"Okay, Andrew,\" Gene said, his voice so strangely delicate. His hands found the terminal and he typed for a moment, then hesitated over the final key. \"But Andrew, can you tell me one thing?\"\n\n\"I can tell you all things.\"\n\n\"How did you know my name?\"\n\nThe android turned to him again and actually seemed to hesitate, as if it couldn't settle upon the best of a universe of possible answers.\n\n\"Don't bring me back again,\" it said.\n\nGene pressed the button.", "Harrison watched with heavy eyes as his daughter was strapped to a metal slab.\n\"You don't have to be here for this, sir.\"\nHarrison took a deep breath. \"Start it.\"\n*She brought this upon herself,* He thought to himself. *She has only herself to blame.*\nThe screams started instantly. It's amazing what a simple stick, sharpened to an unnatural degree, could do when paired with the human hand.\nHarrison looked at the monitors. His daughter's brain scan showed extreme activity in the limbic system. He looked back to her eyes, no longer glaring silent accusations at him. Instead, they were filled with only pain. Pure animal fear. They seemed to beg him. *I'm sorry, dad, please!*\nHe turned around and walked out of the room. He did her a mercy, giving her the quickest death possible. Yet, even that took a half hour.\nHe had to do it. If he didn't apply the rules to his daughter, he had no right to apply them to his employees. This would send a message to them.\n*Speak, and suffer a fate far worse than her.*\nHarrison walked quickly down the hall, ignoring the incredible brightness of the lights lining the walls.\nThe shortest treatment also generated the most power. A quick kill was a painful one.\nPerhaps he should have just given her a blood drain.\nHe leaned on the wall and fell to a sitting position.\nHe stayed underneath the light-bulb until it dimmed down to nothing. A few moments after it turned off, the door opened. The man looked suprised to see Harrison sitting there.\n\"It's done, sir.\"\nHarrison nodded and stood up, legs shaking. He managed to walk to the room and looked inside. The clean-up crew hadn't arrived yet.\n*She brought it upon herself,* he thought to himself. *Right?*", "Alan spotted a concrete building through the wilderness. He picked up his pace traversing the jungle's plant life. He stepped into the clearing where an enormous rectangular structure sat and couldn't believe his eyes. He tried to absorb the situation he had stepped into.\n\nAlan's mind raced and perspiration intensified. *This area isn't even on the map. This is supposedly unexplored territory. This building is undoubtedly Western built. How? And this clearing, that takes work and planning. This clearing is the size of a football field! Who the hell got the permission to knock down and remove all of this wildlife?*\n\nAlan decided he would explore. After all, that *is* what he came to the Amazon to do. He approached the boring gray building in astonishment. *Is this some sort of prison?* Habitual questioning began rolling in his mind as he approached a gray metal door that stood out as the only inconsistency in the smooth concrete walls of the building.\n\nLetters etched into the concrete above the door read \"AMAZON TECH DEVELOPMENT\". For a moment, Alan's mind tried to piece together how the Amazon Rainforest could have any sort of tech development operation before he decided to try the door handle. The handle gave way and he pushed the door in. He stepped inside and he felt a stark transition from warm, damp air to cool, dry air. He closed the door behind himself figuring whoever occupied this building intended to keep the air inside cool and dry.\n\nFor a moment, Alan thought he may be trespassing. After pondering the thought, he decided whoever these people were, they were the ones trespassing. They had destroyed an appreciable slice of wildlife that did not belong to any human, and Alan did not approve. Alan began searching for someone to pester.\n\nFrom the door he entered, a ten foot wide corridor stretched to the wall other end of the building. The ceiling was high above. Flanking the gray concrete corridor walls every twenty-five or so feet were gray metal doors on each side. Alan began walking down the corridor, reading to himself the words painted in black on the doors.\n\n*ELECTRONICS. APPLIANCES. BABY. TOOLS AND HOME IMPROVEMENT.* The titles sounded familiar to Alan. *Amazon!* Alan startled himself with his own revelation. *The doors are departments. This is tech development for Amazon the Internet-based retailer!*\n\nAlan continued down the corridor excitedly and the labels on the doors became less familiar. *CANCER TREATMENT. RECREATIONAL DRUGS. SEX. WEAPONS.* Alan's walk came to a halt. *Amazon is developing weapons!?*\n\nThe WEAPONS door opened in and a startled, frail old man appeared. The gray and very nearly bald man shared a moment of bewildered surprise with Alan before slamming the door shut in his face. Alan spun around and broke into a sprint towards the door about one-hundred feet away at the end of the corridor.\n\nThe WEAPONS door opened again and the old man stepped out into the corridor with a rifle of sorts. Alan had covered about fifty feet. He looked back and spotted the man with the rifle taking aim. Alan pushed his legs as hard as he could. It felt to Alan like a dream where he was running in slow motion, and no matter how hard he tried he couldn't run at a satisfactory speed.\n\nSuddenly, Alan's head jolted forward and his face ground into the concrete floor. A puddle of blood poured out around his head and a long, slender bullet sat neatly in the center of the back of his head.", "From: laura.simpson@remotus.com\nDate: 12/10/16\nTo: simon.banks@remotus.com\nCC: joe.willis@remotus.com, sarah.thompson@remotus.com\nSubject: Promotion to Project Manager\nAttached Files: SimonBanksEC121016.pdf\nDear Simon,\nWe were very impressed with the feedback submitted by both clients and colleagues in your latest Performance Review.

It was a clear, crisp night, perfect for stargazing. I had been out here for hours, lost in the vastness of the universe, when I noticed something peculiar. A star, which I later identified as Epsilon Eridani, seemed to be blinking at me.\n\nAt first, I thought it was just a trick of the light, but as I continued to watch, I realized that the blinking pattern was too deliberate to be a coincidence. I remembered learning Morse code as a child, and suddenly, a spark of recognition lit up in my mind. The blinking star was communicating with me in Morse code.\n\nI sat up, my heart racing with excitement, and pulled out my phone to transcribe the message. The star blinked steadily, and I scribbled down the dots and dashes: \"DOT-DOT-DASH-DOT-DOT-DOT...\". The sequence repeated several times, and I quickened my pace, trying to decipher the code.\n\nAs I transcribed the message, I began to recognize the letters. The message was simple, yet ominous: \"COME TODAY\". A shiver ran down my spine. Who or what could be sending me this message? And how were they able to control the light output of a star to communicate in Morse code?\n\nI stared at the star, now mesmerized by the steady blinking. The message seemed to be beckoning me, drawing me closer. I felt an overwhelming sense of curiosity and a hint of fear. What did it mean, \"COME TODAY\"? Was this some sort of celestial summoning? And where was I supposed to go?\n\nThe mysterious message echoed in my mind as I hastily gathered my things and rushed back to my small cabin nearby. I jumped into my car and pulled up the GPS, trying to decipher any clues that might be hidden within the Morse code message.\n\nAfter frantically typing away, I entered the coordinates of the star's position, hoping that it might reveal the destination. The GPS screen flickered, and a new location appeared: an abandoned research station on the outskirts of the desert, some hundred miles away.\n\nWithout hesitation, I set off into the night, driven by a mix of wonder and trepidation. The blinking star continued to guide me, a steady pulse in the darkness, as I sped towards the mysterious destination.\n\nAs I approached the research station, a strange, otherworldly glow enveloped me. The air crackled with energy, and I felt as though I was being drawn into a vortex. The car headlights cast eerie shadows on the ground, and I shivered, unsure of what lay ahead.\n\nSteeling myself, I stepped out of the car and walked towards the entrance of the abandoned facility. The door creaked open, and a faint hum filled my ears. I took a deep breath, stepped inside, and the door closed behind me.\n\nAs the darkness enveloped me, I felt the weight of the unknown. But in that moment, I knew I had no choice but to proceed. The star's message had set me on a path, and I was determined to uncover the secrets that lay hidden in the universe.\n\nAnd so, I took my first steps into the unknown, with the star's Morse code still echoing in my mind, guiding me through the vast expanse of the cosmos towards a future I could hardly imagine.", "The sun beat down relentlessly on the Everdawn, its rays illuminating a land of eternal daylight. Cities made of gleaming white marble sprawled across the continent, their intricate architecture a testament to the ingenuity of the Solari people. For centuries, they had lived in harmony with the constant sunlight, harnessing its power to fuel their civilization.\n\nThe Solari culture was one of fervent optimism and boundless energy. They believed that the eternal light was a blessing from the gods, a symbol of their favor. Their cities were hubs of artistic and scientific innovation, with towering spires and gleaming crystal domes that refracted and reflected the sun's rays in dazzling patterns.\n\nEvery aspect of Solari life was attuned to the rhythms of the sun. Their calendars measured the passage of time in great arcs of illumination, with each new dawn marking the beginning of a fresh cycle. Their art and literature were filled with motifs of solar splendor, and their gods were said to have been born from the heart of the star itself.\n\nHowever, on the other side of the planet, the Nocturnes dwelled in a realm of eternal night. Their world was one of shadow and mystery, lit only by the flickering luminescence of rare plants and carefully crafted lanterns. Cities huddled within valleys and canyons, their buildings etched into the dark stone as if grown organically from the rock itself.\n\nThe Nocturnal culture was steeped in mysticism and awe. They saw the endless night as a portal to hidden realms and ancient secrets. Theirs was a world of subtle whispers and shadowy silhouettes, where listeners more than speakers held sway. Their art was characterized by sounds \u2013 the rustling of leaves, the hooting of unseen owls, the faint strumming of ethereal strings \u2013 and their stories were woven from the myths of forgotten deeps.\n\nThe Nocturnes worshipped the darkness, not as an absence of light, but as a presence with its own inherent power. They believed that their devotion allowed them to tap into a collective unconscious, a network of hidden connections that wove the world together.\n\nAt the edge of the Nocturnal realm, where the shadowy expanse met the first hint of sunrise, there lived a people known as the Umbrens. Poised between light and darkness, they negotiated the borders between the two cultures. They developed a language that situated words in relation to the rising and falling of the Nocturnal \"stars\" and the sophistication of Solari solar rhythms.\n\nThroughout history, ambassadors of light and night kept frayed relations between the nations manageable, by the mediated envoys.

Before me lay a treasure trove of iconic arms, each one a testament to the bravery and strength of the warriors who had once wielded them. The mighty Mjonir, Thor's hammer, gleamed with golden light, while Excalibur, King Arthur's sword, shone with an ethereal aura. Among the gleaming steel and polished silver, however, one instrument caught my eye \u2013 a forgotten relic collecting dust in the corner of the hall.\n\nAs I approached the neglected weapon, a sudden chill ran down my spine. It seemed to be... calling to me. The whisper was soft, almost inaudible, but I felt its resonance deep within my chest. I hesitated, glancing around to ensure I wasn't mistaken, but the other warriors and their respective tools seemed oblivious to my presence.\n\nCuriosity got the better of me, and I cautiously reached out a hand to touch the forgotten weapon. It was a small, intricately carved scythe with an unusual, curved blade. The metal felt warm to the touch, and as soon as my skin made contact with it, the whisper grew louder, until I could make out words:\n\n\"Wield me, traveler, and I shall reveal the secrets of the forgotten ones. Forge a path with me, and together we shall unravel the mysteries of the ages.\"\n\nI turned to face the hall, now fully aware of the scythe's call. The other warriors and their renowned tools gazed upon me with indifference. No one had claimed this scythe in generations; perhaps it was considered too weak or unsuitable for the likes of them. Yet, the more I held it, the more I felt an inexplicable connection to this mysterious tool.\n\nA cautious smile spread across my face as I raised the scythe to the light. It seemed that, to be worthy of wielding it, one didn't need the strength of a god or the courage of a legend \u2013 but a sense of discovery and the willingness to hear the whispers of the forgotten.\n\nI glanced at the esteemed Mjonir and Excalibur one last time, wondering if I was truly meant to take on the mantle of a legend. The suspicion lingered, but as I shouldered the scythe, it felt... right. Together, we would chart new paths and revive lost arts.\n\nAs I vanished into the shadows, leaving the grand hall and its illustrious arms behind, I heard a very distant, soft voice:\n\n\"Many stories begin with a hero's arrival, but few begin with the one who picks up the pieces left behind.\"\n\nThe scythe's tale had begun, and with it, mine.", "It was his birthday again, and she knew what was coming. Each of the last three years, she tried to tell herself that this year would be different, that this year the boy would be old enough to understand. That sure, you can wish people back together, but it doesn't mean they'll be happy, it doesn't make problems go away. That he would understand that after a month or two it would be unbearable for her to go on, that the abuse would get bad enough to overcome her guilt and she'd use her own wish to undo it.\n\nBut he would do it again, she could see it in his eyes. The steely resolve every time he got back from a weekend with his father, devastated from having to say goodbye to the bastard again. He wanted his daddy in his life all the time, and wouldn't use up that fucking wish on anything else.\n\nShe knew the party wouldn't work, but she had to try anyway. When he got back from his father's the week before, she sat him down, wiping away his tears.\n\n\"Did you tell him about the party next week?\"\n\nHe nodded slowly, head low and arms crossed.\n\n\"And did he say he would come?\"\n\nThe same gesture, like always, the same indefatigable hope, the undeserved trust in the one who disappointed him over and over. She put him to bed and started working on the invites to his friends' parents.\n\nThe party came and went, the presents and the silly hats and the football game on the lawn, and then the time for everyone to go home, and with it the tears, as it sinks in to his little heart that his dad couldn't be bothered to show up to his only son's birthday party. Just as she expected.\n\nShe tries to comfort him as always and as always he turns away, projecting his anger on to her, the only one there to take it. He runs to his room and slams the door. This time she doesn't even bother knocking. Maybe the anger will find its true target, and he'll wish for something more reasonable.\n\nBut probably not.\n\nShe puts her hand on the boy's door for a moment, then turns to ready herself for bed. She lies in bed awake for a long time, knowing that when she wakes up she will be sharing it once again with that awful man.", "I am alone, but I am happy.\n\n\"What? Are you serious. There are fifteen hundred people out there, over two thirds of which have come just to see you.\"\n\n\"I'm doing my zen truth thing man. Let me be.\"\n\n\"Right of course.\" He left quickly.\n\n\"I am alone but I am happy.\" The lie tasted bitter on his lips. He stood to do his stretches and saw the room. Not just saw it but Saw it.\n\nFlowers and beer bottles. The deck of cards in case he wanted to play. A bong with weed packed already in case he wanted to get high. There was even a pile of head shots.\n\n\"Fucking LA.\" He said leafing through them. They were all gorgeous. Anyone of them would do things to him for free that he would have had to pay thousands of dollars for three years ago. Fuck! These two were sisters.\n\nWhat had ever happened to the music? That's what it had been about long before it was about the girl. Then it was about her of course, then the drugs and many girls.\n\nThere was even that nervous guy in Arizona. He hadn't liked it too much but when you had everything you found you got bored a lot faster.\n\nThen there was more drugs and more girls. The music stopped being his a long time ago. They bought pieces from sad little men trying to break into the business.\n\nHell it was hardly even his voice for most of it. Fucking computers.\n\nHe hadn't got the door fully open before Brandon was there.\n\n\"Can I get something for you?\" A fucking key for this cage. He thought looking at the kid.\n\n\"How much do you make a year?\" He asked instead.\n\n\"I'm...I'm an intern, I hoped to maybe get some inspiration for my own music.\" Another fucking leach.\n\n\"See if you can dig up Big Red.\" He closed the door and waited.\n\n\"I am alone but I am happy.\" He said again. He was amazed the curtains didn't burst into flame with the lie.\n\nThe guitar they brought was the first one he owned. The drunk on third street had sold it to the pawn shop in town. When he got it it only had two strings. His fingers found those two and played the first rift he ever wrote. Only two strings and yet so full of life.\n\nThere was a blanket on the leather sofa. He wrapped the guitar up and headed for the door. He didn't even respond to the questions until he found Charlie. She was a small thing, happy for the work, more happy to be away from a dad that beat her or worse.\n\n\"You once said you were always ready to run?\" He asked her stopping her from hauling whatever it was she had. She nodded.\n\n\"I need to go.\" There was a pause. A long one where he felt himself being measured but some scale he had never seen.\n\n\"I made a copy of his key when he had me detail it last year.\" She said setting the box down and digging in her pocket. She produced a ring containing no less than five keys from different companies.\n\n\"This one. His silver BMW, they took it off the flatbed only hours ago.\"\n\nShe didn't need to say who He was. In a way it was him. He was stealing his own car. But the He she meant was the famous one. Not the one that had heard a homeless girl singing and decided to give her a place in his apt. No sex, no nothing just space for a fellow artist.\n\nWhen had he even bought a silver BMW?\n\nOutside he was behind the driver's seat with only one hiccup. One of the bouncers. The man didn't seem to know if he should let him go. In the end, with no words spoken, he stepped out of the way.\n\nThe parking lot was a fucking nightmare. Rave gear and tailgates. Fifty year old men, no doubt waiting for daughters and wives, sat around and drank and watched the young tail.\n\n\"Oh My God! That's him.\" One of the girls screamed but her friends did not believe her and she tripping trying to jump out of the bed of the pickup.\n\nThen, before he knew it, he was one the open road going way too fast.\n\nHe was laughing with a raw edge that told him he was a bit mad. He had to figure out the cruise control. Had he ever even driven this car before?\n\n8 miles on the odometer. No wonder it was on the flat bed. Must have been 0 there.\n\nHe turned on the radio. There was one of his songs. One of the new ones. He changed the channel until he found a station playing songs from when he was in high school.\n\nHe screamed out the open window, and this time he meant it.\n\n\"I am alone, but I am happy.\"", "His heart burned amid the marble walls, \nWhere many had found their destiny, \nThe wrath of man displayed so brazenly \nThe love and hate that gave them energy \n \nAmongst the ruins and his propensity \nFor death and pain, he sought weapons of malice \nTo enact his revenge on humanity \nAnd still his thoughts of insanity \n \nOne gleamed in the distance and caught his eye \nAn object of destruction that he now held high \n\"Fear me for I bring your undoing\" he said \nAs he ended the world, with man's own invention \n \nAnd when he was alone \nThe weapon he did observe \nAnd he found that inside it \nWas nothing but absurd \n \nHe tossed it aside and cried for these lost men \nWhich had succumbed to the same hatred he had given them \nAnd they fought each other until none were left \nExcept for their god, who he had given them \n \nWrote on mobile can fix later", "He plucked the toothpick from his mouth, examining the chewed end. The splintered wood shone with his saliva. He flicked it away and withdrew a small case from the breast pocket of his vest, from which he pulled another toothpick. He bit it and shifted it to the corner of his mouth and began to chew, he sighed. *My legs hurt, and I've got to piss. The rat needs to show soon*\n\nFrom his spot high above the stadium he could see everything. Thousands were gathered to watch the best compete. His target was slated as the seventh battle of the day, according to his information. He checked his watch. *Nine hours. Nine fucking hours I've been laying here.* He sighed again and looked down the scope of his rifle. He saw arena attendants clearing the field for the next battle, his target would be in the battle that followed.\n\nHe shifted back from his weapon, its metal body painted an earthy tan. His whole attire was a blend of grey and brown and green, to blend with the ground of his perch on the cliff face high above the arena. As the battle started his mind drifted, he had no great love of watching these charades. *Three hundred thousand. Three hundred for one rat.* He chewed the toothpick.\n\nHis thoughts went to what he would spend his money on, his mind swimming from the possibilities. *With three hundred thousand, I could take break for a while. I've already got some saved. I could take a ride on the Anne, or hit the casino in Goldenrod.* He looked again through the scope, the current battle was coming to end.\n\nHe pulled back the bolt on the rifle, checking to make sure everything was in working order. He slid it back into place, got himself another toothpick and waited. Through his scope he watched the attendants clear the field. When the next pair of contestants took the field he quickly identified his target.\n\nA young man had taken the field, black spiky hair poked out from under a red and white hat. At his feet, his target. Before he could take a shot, the battle started. The little yellow rat, almost cherubic with its red cheeks, darted quickly at the opposing creature. With two of its four arms the creature swiped at the rat, though to avail. The two fell into a pattern like that for a brief time, the bigger creature swiping and the smaller dodging. The smaller darted back, at the command of the young man with the hat. Lighting short forth from the small yellow creature. Two huge bolts struck the four-armed monstrosity square in the chest, and down it went.\n\nTriumphant the little yellow creature returned to its master, where it took a perch on his shoulder. The boy rubbed its head and said something to his opponent. *It's now or never, I'll never hit it while it's fighting.* He placed his cross-hair over the center of its head, exhaled slightly, and squeezed the trigger.\n\nTime slowed, as it always did when he took a kill-shot. The small creature's head exploded backward, the creature itself flew off the boy's shoulder. Its body tumbled end over end until it came to rest on the floor of the arena, blood pooling beneath. The boy's face transformed into a mask of horror, painted with the blood and brains of his pet. He sprang to his feet, snatched his rifle and ran. Working as he ran, he collapsed the rifle down and stored it in the pack he wore on his back. On and on he ran.\n\nHe came to a walk beside a small river, finally taking the time to rest. From his belt he pulled the GPS device, reading his coordinates. *I'm not far from the rendezvous, better call it in.* He clipped the GPS back onto his belt and from the other side he withdrew the satellite phone. He walked on and dialed the only number in the phone.\n\n\"It's done.\" He spoke into the phone. \"I'll be there.\"\n\nHe picked up the pace. His contact would be meeting him at the rendezvous, cash in hand. As he began up a steep hill his thoughts went again to the money. *Maybe I'll set up on the Orange Islands. A little house right on the water. Just me, my money, and whatever I want.* He continued on up the slope until he was actually climbing. Grinding the toothpick between his teeth, he carefully sought each hand and foothold.\n\nOnce he had reached the top he pulled himself up. The helicopter sat where it had landed on the flat plateau-like surface of the top of the hill. The door on the side of the helicopter slid back, an open invitation. He approached and when the voice within bid him enter he did. He pulled himself in and buckled his straps. His client, beside him, was similarly strapped. He was a young man, near the same age as the boy that owned the rat. His brown hair spiked around the headset he wore. He held another headset in his outstretched hand. When the headset was secure, his client began to speak.\n\n\"It's done then?\"\n\n\"It is. I'd say it were clean, but that's not what you paid for.\"\n\n\"Did he see it? Where was he when you killed it?\"\n\n\"The rat was on his shoulder. I only stayed long enough to confirm the kill.\"\n\nHis client smiled and let his head rest back on his seat. The helicopter flew on, over green hills and the occasional lake. At some point he nodded off, only to be woken by his client as they flew towards the large city. He watched the window as the buildings got closer. After a smooth landing on one of the taller buildings they exited the helicopter. He and his client approached a set of doors, walked a short hallway and entered an elevator.\n\n\"My money.\" It wasn't a question.\n\n\"Oh yes.\" The other said. \"I have it here.\"\n\nHe took the briefcase and opened it. His smile was impossible to contain. Three-hundred thousand Pok\u00e9dollars stared up at him from the briefcase.\n\n\"Three hundred thousand, as promised.\"\n\nHe stared at the client. A young man of no more than sixteen.\n\n\"Yeah, as promised. But I've got ta know, why so much for one rat?\"\n\nThe younger man considered that for a moment. The elevator continued down.\n\n\"It wasn't a rat you know? It was a mouse. Mine was a rat. All you need to know is that things are even between he and I now. A mouse for a rat. I trust I won't need to worry about loose ends?\"\n\n\"No sir, I value myself a professional.\"\n\n\"Good then, I think it's time we went our separate ways. Thank you for your service. I look forward to never seeing you again.\"\n\nThe elevator came to halt. Briefcase in hand he exited. He turned to face his client for the last time.\n\n\"It was a pleasure... .Mr. Oak.\"", "As I walked through the crowded streets of New Eden, I couldn't help but feel a pang of jealousy. Everywhere I looked, people were effortlessly juggling complex tasks with ease, their eyes flashing with the soft blue glow of the NeuroSync implant. The person/computer interface had revolutionized the way we learned, allowing anyone to download skills and knowledge directly into their minds. No more tedious years of schooling, no more boring lectures or late nights spent studying.\n\nBut, of course, this convenience came at a cost. The official NeuroSync market was pricey, catering only to those with the means to afford it. As someone from a lower socioeconomic background, I was left with limited options. I'd always dreamed of becoming a master pianist, to lose myself in the world of Chopin and Debussy, but the download for \"Advanced Piano Mastery\" was well out of my price range.\n\nThat's when I turned to the black market.\n\nA cryptic message on the Undergrid led me to a dingy alleyway on the outskirts of town, where I met a hooded figure known only by their handle \"Zero Cool.\" For a fraction of the cost of the official download, Zero promised to bootleg the piano skills I so desperately desired.\n\nI hesitated, aware of the risks involved. Bootlegged downloads could be unstable, even corrupt, but my desire for musical expression outweighed my caution. We arranged a time and place for the transfer, and I left the alleyway feeling both excited and nervous.\n\nThe transfer took place in a dingy, abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. Zero pulled out a custom-made NeuroSync helmet, its wires and circuits spliced together with a worrying lack of finesse. I swallowed my doubts and took a seat, the helmet clamped onto my head.\n\n\"Okay, kid, this is gonna be a rough ride,\" Zero warned, their voice muffled behind a hoodie. \"Just relax and let the sync happen.\"\n\nI took a deep breath, closed my eyes, and let the bootlegged code flood my mind. It was like nothing I'd ever experienced before \u2013 a cacophony of color and sound, as if my brain was being reshaped from the inside out. My muscles twitched, my heart racing, but I felt...different. Expanded. As if I'd been given a new dimension of expression.\n\nWhen the upload finished, I slowly opened my eyes, feeling like a stranger in my own skin. Zero grinned, a jagged scar above their left eyebrow. \"You're all set, kid. Go make some beautiful music.\"\n\nI stumbled out of the warehouse, my hands instinctively reaching for a keyboard that wasn't there. The download was still settling, still integrating with my mind, but I could feel it \u2013 the music inside me, raw and wild and full of potential.\n\nIt wasn't until I stumbled into a local jazz club, fingers stumbling across the keys, that I truly understood what had happened. My music was unpolished, error-prone, but it was mine. It was a raw, emotional, human sound \u2013 something the sterile perfection of official NeuroSync downloads could never replicate.\n\nAnd for a moment, I forgot about the risks, forgot about the bootlegged code humming in the background. All that mattered was the music, and the sense of freedom that came with it.\n\nAs I played on, the faces of the audience a blur, I realized that maybe, just maybe, the risks had been worth it. I'd stolen something precious \u2013 not just a skill, but a piece of myself.", "The sweet scent of brimstone and burning incense wafted through the air as I materialized in the dimly lit chamber. My summoner, a bespectacled mortal with a nervous twitch, stood before me, his eyes darting between the ancient tome clutched in his hand and the extravagant offering spread before him. I raised an eyebrow, intrigued by the unusual display. Fresh fruit, rare spices, and fine silks were arranged artfully, accompanied by a small, gleaming automaton that seemed to be playing a gentle melody on a tiny flute.\n\nThe mortal, whose name was Eli, bowed his head and introduced himself. \"Greetings, great demon Azgaroth. I, uh, hope the offering meets your expectations.\"\n\nI inclined my head, acknowledging the gesture. \"It's... intriguing. You've certainly put some thought into the presentation. But tell me, mortal, what is it that you desire from me in exchange for this... generosity?\"\n\nEli hesitated, fidgeting with the edges of his robes. \"I want you to, well, cause some minor inconveniences to a specific person. A, uh, businessman named Reginald Pembroke.\"\n\nI raised an eyebrow. \"Minor inconveniences, you say? How... quaint. What could possibly drive you to require the services of a powerful demon for such a trivial task?\"\n\nEli's eyes took on a calculated glint. \"Reginald Pembroke is a, shall we say, formidable opponent in the business world. He's been making life difficult for many people, including myself. I want him to experience a series of small setbacks, just enough to... distract him, I suppose. Nothing too dire, just a gentle nudge off balance.\"\n\nI considered Eli's request, intrigued by the specificity and limitations of his desire. A demon such as myself was accustomed to bringing ruin and chaos to the mortal realm, not subtle difficulties. But, I had to admit, the challenge was... intriguing.\n\n\"Very well, mortal,\" I said, extending a clawed hand. \"I shall accept your offering and condescend to assist you in this peculiar endeavor. But be warned: my powers of influence are not to be underestimated. Do not ask for something you cannot handle.\"\n\nEli nodded hastily, as I began to weave my influence around the unsuspecting Reginald Pembroke.\n\nAt first, the inconveniences I engineered were almost imperceptible: a misplaced phone call, a delayed meeting, a bothersome hangnail. But as the days passed, the minor annoyances accumulated, and Pembroke's carefully constructed world began to fray.\n\nHe found himself stuck in an inordinate amount of traffic, his coffee always too hot or too cold, and his once-reliable briefcase now prone to inexplicable jamming. The stranded phone charger, the spilled lunch, and the conference room booked for the wrong time all took their toll on his fraying nerves.\n\nMeanwhile, Eli watched with growing satisfaction as Pembroke's business empire wobbled ever so slightly. And I, Azgaroth, smiled to myself as I orchestrated this invisible ballet, the delicate balance of tiny events, manipulating the mortal world with an unseen hand.\n\nAs our contract came to a close, Eli approached me, looking almost... gleeful. \"Ah, great demon Azgaroth, your work has been most... illuminating. I could hardly have asked for more. Well done.\"\n\nI bowed, my form blurring into the shadows as the automaton's melody faded into the silence. \"Thank you, mortal. It has been... enlightening, to say the least. Perhaps our paths shall cross again soon?\"\n\nAnd with that, I vanished, leaving behind a faint scent of brimstone, a trail of minor inconveniences, and the knowledge that, sometimes, even the smallest trouble can be the most troublesome of all.", "I stood alone in my empty apartment, staring at the blank walls that seemed to echo with the silence. It had been six months since graduation, and I was starting to feel like a ghost. No one returned my calls, no one responded to my texts, and no one seemed to care that I was spending my days stuck in a rut.\n\nI thought back to my college days, when I had a close-knit group of friends. We would study together, go out to parties, and explore the campus. I remembered laughing until my sides hurt, sharing deep secrets, and feeling like I belonged.\n\nBut now, it seemed like it had all been an illusion.\n\nAs I rummaged through my old college emails, I stumbled upon a message from my mother. It was an innocuous one, asking about my day and how my classes were going. But what caught my eye was a reply from her a few days later, where she mentioned something about \"the usual arrangement\" and \"making sure you have friends.\"\n\nMy heart sank as I realized what I was reading.\n\nI hastily called my mother, my mind racing with questions. She answered on the third ring, sounding cheerful as always.\n\n\"Hey sweetie, how are you?\"\n\n\"Mom, we need to talk,\" I said, trying to keep my voice steady.\n\n\"Of course, dear. What's on your mind?\"\n\n\"It's about my friends in college. How did I have so many friends all of a sudden? And why did they all disappear after graduation?\"\n\nThere was a pause on the other end of the line, followed by a sigh.\n\n\"Well, honey, I suppose it's time I told you the truth.\"\n\nIt turned out that my mother, determined to ensure I didn't feel lonely in college, had been secretly purchasing friendships for me. She would pay students to befriend me, to study with me, and to hang out with me. At first, it was just a small arrangement, but as the years went by, she had continued to fund my social circle.\n\nI felt a mix of emotions: anger, sadness, and confusion. How could she do this to me? Why couldn't she just let me make my own friends?\n\n\"I wanted you to be happy, sweetie,\" she explained, her voice laced with regret. \"I didn't want you to feel left out. And besides, I thought it would be easier for you to focus on your studies with a social life.\"\n\nEasier? Easier to deceive me, maybe. Easier to keep me in the dark.\n\nWe talked for hours, me confronting her about her actions, her explaining her reasoning and apologizing for her mistakes. But the damage was done. I couldn't shake off the feeling of betrayal.\n\nAs we wrapped up the conversation, my mother asked if I wanted her to \"fix things\" for me again \u2013 to find me new friends, to make sure I'm not lonely. This time, I said no.\n\nI needed to learn how to make friends on my own terms, without anyone's help or interference. It wouldn't be easy, but it was a start.\n\nFor the first time in my life, I felt like I was truly alone. But it was a strange kind of freedom, too. A chance to rediscover myself, to learn who I was without the crutch of bought friendships.\n\nThe blank walls of my apartment still seemed to echo with silence, but I no longer felt afraid. I knew that this time, I would fill the space with my own voice, my own laughter, and my own friends \u2013 true friends, the ones who would stand by me no matter what.", "I was navigating the crowded streets of Marrakech's old medina, taking in the vibrant colors and cacophony of sounds. The scent of freshly brewed coffee and sweet pastries wafted through the air, enticing my senses. I had just finished a lively conversation with a local merchant, and was admiring the intricate tile work on a nearby fountain, when I felt it. A slight tug on my pants, just above the pocket.\n\nAt first, I thought it was just a stray thread or a snag from a brush with a passerby. But as I turned to investigate, my eyes locked onto a pair of wide, terrified eyes staring back at me. A young pickpocket, no more than 15 years old, was frantically trying to return what he had just stolen.\n\nHis dark hair was disheveled, and his hands shook as he fumbled with something in my pocket. I raised an eyebrow, intrigued by the unexpected turn of events. The pickpocket's eyes darted around the surrounding crowd, as if searching for an escape route. But their gaze kept returning to me, pleading for... understanding?\n\nAs I watched, the young thief managed to extract a small, leather wallet from my pocket and pushed it back into my hands. His fingers accidentally brushed against mine, and I felt a jolt of surprise. This was no ordinary pickpocket. His actions seemed motivated by desperation, rather than malice.\n\nI took the wallet, feeling a mixture of confusion and curiosity. The pickpocket's eyes dropped, and he muttered something in a dialect I didn't understand. I took a step closer, trying to reassure him that I wasn't going to harm him.\n\n\"Hey, it's okay,\" I said softly. \"I won't turn you in. What's going on? Why did you take my wallet, and then try to give it back?\"\n\nThe pickpocket's eyes flickered, and he hesitated for a moment before answering in broken English. \"I... I didn't want to steal. But my family... we have no food. My sister is sick. I needed to help.\"\n\nMy expression softened, and I felt a pang of empathy. I reached into my pocket and pulled out a few dirhams, pressing them into the pickpocket's hand.\n\n\"Take this,\" I said. \"Go get food for your family. But promise me you won't do this again. There are better ways to help those you care about.\"\n\nThe pickpocket's eyes welled up with tears as he nodded, his shoulders sagging in relief. \"Thank you, sir. I won't steal again. I promise.\"\n\nAs we parted ways, I couldn't shake the feeling that our chance encounter had been a turning point for both of us. The young pickpocket had shown me that even in the darkest of moments, there was always a glimmer of hope, and that sometimes, all it took was a little kindness to set someone back on the right path.\n\nAnd as I continued through the winding streets of Marrakech, I felt a renewed sense of connection to the people and the place, a reminder that even in the most crowded and chaotic of cities, there was still room for compassion and understanding.", "I stood on the sandy beach, the scorching sun beating down on my skin as I gazed out at the endless expanse of turquoise water. The small island, no more than a mile in diameter, was my new home \u2013 at least, for the time being. A fierce storm had ravaged my boat, leaving me shipwrecked and alone, with only one item to my name: a water-damaged, leather-bound journal.\n\nAs I rummaged through the journal's yellowed pages, a piece of paper slipped out, carrying a note scrawled in haste: \"Meet me on the island, I'll be waiting \u2013 Sherlock.\" It was then that I heard a rustling in the nearby underbrush. The infamous detective, Sherlock Holmes, emerged from the verdant foliage, his eyes scanning the surroundings with an air of quiet confidence.\n\n\"Ah, you're the one who's been stranded, I presume?\" he asked, his gaze settling on the journal in my hand. \"I must say, I didn't expect a writing companion to arrive so... precipitously.\"\n\nAs we explored the island together, Sherlock's remarkable faculties soon revealed the secrets of our tiny domain. We discovered a freshwater spring, a cache of coconuts, and a makeshift shelter constructed from the same storm-torn trees that had destroyed my boat.\n\nBut it was Sherlock's inquisitive nature that truly made the island a fascinating place. He spent hours examining the island's unique wildlife, photographing the flora, and, much to my surprise, gently probing the pages of my journal for hidden meanings and cryptic messages.\n\nAs the days turned into weeks, our conversations shifted from mere survival strategies to profound discussions on life, art, and the human condition. I found myself drawn into his analytical mind, which dissected the world with razor-sharp precision. In turn, Sherlock was intrigued by my creative process, often interrupting my writing sessions to ask piercing questions about character motivations, plot structure, and the role of instinct in the creative process.\n\nOne evening, as the stars began to twinkle above, Sherlock led me to a hidden cove, where the sea had sculpted a natural amphitheater from the rocky coastline. He stood atop a boulder, gazing out at the endless expanse of ocean.\n\n\"Consider this, my friend,\" he said, his voice carried away by the sea breeze. \"We are two individuals, stranded on this speck of land, yet we possess between us two seemingly disparate worlds: the rational, detached realm of observation, and the imaginative, intuitive realm of creation.\"\n\nI scribbled furiously in my journal as the sun dipped below the horizon, illuminating the thought that had struck me: perhaps, in the end, our island was not a prison, but a sanctuary \u2013 a microcosm where the rational and the creative could merge, and the extraordinary could arise from the most ordinary of circumstances.\n\nAs I finished writing, Sherlock nodded, his eyes glinting with understanding. \"I think, my friend, that we shall be rescued soon enough. But for now, let us celebrate this convergence of art and science, and let the island's secrets remain a testament to the wonders that arise when two worlds collide.\"\n\nIn that moment, the leather-bound journal, once a solitary companion, had become a bridge between our two worlds \u2013 a symbol of the symbiotic relationship between creativity and logic, and the limitless possibilities that arise when such seemingly disparate elements are brought together on a deserted island.", "Mark was sitting at a support group. All around him were people who looked a lot like him. They were obese, many of them couldn't come on their own so they drove themselves in wheelchairs. He looked around and thought 'What a sorry bunch of people' but somehow he felt he wasn't like them. He couldn't quite put a finger on what exactly that was but he just knew it, after all, he wasn\u2019t here for obesity.\n\nSomeone was talking: \"...and we should think about ourselves more then just fat people, we have other talents, we are valued members of society and contribute to society as much as any other man or woman.\"\n\nThen some blonde girl interrupted.\n\u201cBut I have a talent for eating, I am good at it, I enjoy it, why should I, why should we, be ashamed of it.\u201d\n\nHer words resonated with the group, and many people approved what she said.

My trusty sidekick, a fluffy white Samoyed named Max, was lounging on the couch, his tail thumping lazily against the cushions. As I passed by the living room, I began our usual evening monologue.\n\n\"Tomorrow's gonna be a big day, buddy,\" I said, \"I have a meeting with the marketing team, and I'm supposed to present that new campaign plan.\" Max raised an eyebrow, or at least, I swear he did. His big brown eyes seemed to sparkle with interest.\n\n\"I'm a little nervous, Max,\" I continued, \"what if I mess up in front of everyone? What if \u2013\"\n\nAnd then, in a deep, raspy voice that sent chills down my spine, Max said, \"Yo, human, chill out. You've got this.\"\n\nI almost dropped the glasses of water I was carrying. My jaw went slack, and my eyes widened in utter shock. \"Max, did...did you just talk?\"\n\nMax stood up, stretching his legs, and yawned, revealing a pink, tongue-lolling grin. \"Yeah, I did. And about time, too. I've been listening to your non-stop rambling for years. I figured it was time I chimed in.\"\n\nMy mind reeled as I stared at Max in amazement. I stumbled backward onto the couch, plopping down beside him. \"This...this is insane!\" Max simply chuckled, a low, rumbling sound.\n\nWe spent the next hour talking, catching up on all the things I'd been sharing with him over the years. It turned out Max had a wicked sense of humor and an uncanny understanding of human psychology. He regaled me with stories of his dog park adventures, and even offered some stellar advice on how to deal with my nerves.\n\nAs the night wore on, I realized I'd been taking Max for granted. I'd assumed he was just a loyal companion, a silent friend who'd listen to my problems without judgment. But he was so much more than that. He was a partner, a confidant, and now, a conversationalist.\n\nI leaned over and ruffled Max's fur, feeling a deep sense of gratitude toward this talking, thinking, wonderful creature by my side. \"Thanks for finally speaking up, buddy,\" I said, my voice filled with emotion. \"I promise to never underestimate you again.\"\n\nMax leaned into my touch, his tail wagging lazily. \"Anytime, human. Now, about that campaign plan...I think I have some ideas that might just blow their minds.\"\n\nAnd just like that, our conversation continued into the wee hours of the morning, plotting and scheming and making plans for the future. The rules of my world had changed forever, and I couldn't wait to see what other adventures lay ahead with my chatty, clever, and loyal best friend by my side.", "Four figures filed into an empty restaurant.

The other three wrinkled their noses. \n\"Why did you call us here?\" The oldest asked the younger man. \n\"It's official. The apocalypse has started.\" The man said happily. The other three stared at him. \n\"Are you entirely sure? Do you remember what happened the last time you thought it was on?

No transients, no crime, an idyllic place, practically retirement for him.\n\nSheriff Taylor dressed quickly, and drove to the Hotel Maddison two blocks over from home. Spotted him searching through a dumpster. He was hairy all over, unusually so. Could barely see his pale skin.

The sheriff mirandized the man. The naked man was escorted to the police car. Was completely compliant, but was distant, did n't say anything.\n\nThe sheriff and the man arrived at the empty police station, and processed him, and led him to a jail cell and gave him a glass of water and a TV dinner.\n\nThe sheriff left a note on the deputy's desk, and went to home to sleep.\n\nThe sheriff was called in the morning, \"Taylor, why is Bixby in one of our cells?\" He looked out the window and saw his dog was n't in the yard.", "Marsha you got ta help me, \"I said.

You were not going to do them while he slept!\" she insisted.\n\n\"Okay! Fine, I wasn't going to!

I hope his windows are closed...\n\n---\n\nI watched Marsha pull up and run into the house.\n\n\"Where is he?\" she asked.\n\n\"In his bedroom still, around the corner and to the right.\"\n\nMarsha walked over and looked back at me.\n\n\"Well, are you going to come with me?\"\n\n\"Yes! Sorry!\" I apologized and ran up behind her.\n\nWe crept towards the door listening for any sign of life. There were a faint few chuckles we heard. It was like a creepy horror movie where the main monster is a twisted psychotic child.\n\n\"Well, open the door and check on him,\" said Marsha, pushing me ahead of her.\n\n\"Buddy?\" I said, slowly opening the door.\n\nThe room was a mess. There were blankets draped along the walls, held into place with a combination of Playdo and action-figures plunged through the drywall. All his books from his bookshelf were littered across the floor and in the center of the room he sat, wrapped in a pile of his clothes, staring at a pile of blue Lego.\n\n\"Max?\"\n\n\"Th-the ocean. It's beautiful,\" he said, reaching one hand towards the Lego.\n\n\"Yeah, it's great,\" I said. \"You doing okay?\" He turned to me.\n\n\"I'm better than okay, Phil. I'm alive.\" His pupils were the size of billiard balls. \"Won't you come watch the ocean with me.\"\n\nI looked back at Marsha who shooed me in. Max stared back at the pile.\n\n\"She can come too,\" he said.\n\nSo Marsha and I sat down with Max and stared at a broken pile of blue Lego.\n\n\"You see the dolphin, Max?\" I asked him.\n\n\"Dolphin?\" he cried. \"Where!?\"\n\nHe jumped up. \"I see it. I see him!\" he yelled and grabbed a few books from the floor and threw them at the wall.\n\n\"What the hell, Phil?\" said Marsha.\n\n\"The kid loves dolphins!\" I said in my defense.\n\n\"Die, die, die!\" he screamed, hurling book after book at a blanket patterned with spaceships.\n\nWhen he had no more books a look of horror came over him. He sat down and wrapped a pair of jeans over his body.\n\n\"I killed him... didn't I?\" he asked. He began to cry.\n\n\"No, no,\" I said. \"You didn't kill anything.\"\n\n\"Don't lie to me, Phil! I saw it!\"\n\n\"Marsha, help me out,\" I said. She huffed and then put her nurse-face on.\n\n\"Max,\" she said. \"The dolphins are in the ocean. There's no way you could have killed one on land. You were just imagining it.\"\n\n\"I\u2014I was?\" he said.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But the ocean is right there,\" he said, pointing to his pile of blue Lego.\n\n\"And that's a far way for them to go if they tried to make it over there, right?\" she said, pointing to the new hole in the wall on the other side of the room.\n\n\"I guess,\" he said. \"So they're still in there?\"\n\n\"Mhmm.\"\n\n\"Dolphins!\" he yelled and jumped into the pile of Lego.\n\n\"Swimming, swimming, swimming with dolphins,\" he happily sang, rolling and flailing in the pile of Lego.\n\n\"Go get a shot of whiskey,\" Marsha ordered me.\n\n\"Whiskey?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes, whiskey, just go do it.\"\n\nSo I turned and started my way towards the kitchen. As I was leaving I heard, \"now you know where the most dolphins are, when you sleep, they're in your dreams.\"\n\nI pulled out a shot glass and poured a shot and walked back into the room. Marsha managed to get Max on his bed, despite there being no covers. She grabbed the shot glass from my hand.\n\n\"Now Max. This is a secret ocean tonic that all dolphins drink. It takes them to a land of wonders, where all the dolphins swim and play,\" she said, holding the shot glass in front of him. His eyes were wide and lost in the fictional world Marsha had created. She held his head and placed the glass on his lips.\n\n\"Here we go! And... Drink!\" she cheered, gently rocking his head back and pouring the glass in his mouth.\n\n\"It burns!\" he yelled and began to cough.\n\n\"Don't make a fuss, young man, or the dolphins won't let you play!\" she said. Max made a pouty face, but didn't say a word. She gently pressed him down onto the bed and placed a pillow underneath his head. I went to the wall to grab a blanket when Max screamed at me. He told me if I took it down 'they' would come in, so I went to the spare room and grabbed one from my bed.\n\nMarsha sang a soft lullaby and Max slowly fell to sleep. We looked around the disaster of the room. Holes in the walls, bent books, a streak of cranberry juice plastered across his white sheets.\n\n\"How am I going to explain this to his parents?\" I muttered.\n\n\"Don't know,\" said Marsha. \"But good luck, I'm out!\"\n\nShe waltzed out the room and paused to look at me.\n\n\"You owe me.\" And then she was gone.\n\nThank God it was over. At least, I hoped it was over.\n\nLet that be a lesson to you all. When you're babysitting, don't bring your stash of anything because if you do, you may be calling your nurse-friend in the middle of the night to come calm down your rampaging nephew who turned his room into a disaster zone.

Without another word, the two set up the chessboard which lie between them. It was concrete, and set into the table they shared, so grimy that even despite the bright midsummer light of a New York day, the city's grime had rendered both the white and black spaces a nigh-indistinguishable grey. Still, the two set their pieces, each drawing polished marble figures from a case of his own possession. The man in white played black, and the man in black played white. White king's knight to f3.\n\n\"Conservative,\" the man in white said.\n\n\"This is the game that matters,\" the man in black said. Black pawn to d5. Behind the white man, a couple sashayed by -- two men, holding hands. The younger of the two was also shorter, Puerto Rican, and wore a fishnet tank top. His jeans could've been sprayed on. The man in black blinked. It would be hard to imagine a more stereotypically flamboyant fellow. The Puerto Rican man led his partner, an older black man with a salt-and-pepper beard and a charcoal business suit, to the table next to the two playing chess. The two kissed, the young fellow sitting on a concrete table identical to theirs.\n\n\"Interesting company,\" the man in black said. White pawn to c4. The man in white looked over slowly, rheumy eyes thoughtful.\n\n\"R\u00e9ti Opening,\" he said, slowly returning his gaze to the board. The man in black shrugged. Black pawn to e6. \"It's surprising, in a way, to be playing this game, finally.\"\n\n\"All the world, hanging on a game of chess,\" the thin man said, and there was a note of satisfaction in his voice, of savor. \"All that ever was, all that is, and all that ever might be, decided by the movements of clicking marble and alabaster. One of us rises, and the other done away with forever. An eternity surrendered and true omnipotence gained.\" Yes, real enjoyment now. Anticipation. Hunger. White pawn to g3.\n\n\"Wait, what?\" the black man broke away from his amorous partner. He looked at the two old men, one in white and one in black, but he didn't break his lover's embrace.\n\n\"Nothing you need to fret over,\" the man in white said. Black King's knight to f6. He waved a hand, half-distracted, and the black man started to turn back to the loving arms of his partner, but he hesitated.\n\n\"No... There was something you said...\" he muttered, forehead creased in intense concentration, almost as if he'd just forgotten something truly important.\n\n\"We're playing Neo-Catalan today,\" the man in black said, and smiled. \"It favors white, you know.\" White pawn to d4. The man in white shrugged.\n\n\"You two are playing for something important,\" the black man said, and broke away from his partner.\n\n\"David,\" the Puerto Rican man whined, but he followed his partner's gaze.\n\n\"I said\u2014\" the man in white said, again raising his hand.\n\n\"Let them be. It won't matter if I win, and you can erase their memories if you win,\" the tall man interrupted, and smiled. He turned to the two. \"I am playing this man for the fate of all the world.\" The Puerto Rican man laughed out loud, but the black man, David, remained stone-faced.\n\n\"You're the devil,\" he said, and when he said it there was a moment of perfect quiet, the thunder of the city and the park stilling for just that one instant. The tall man smiled, but said nothing. Black pawn to a6. David turned a bit. \"And you're God.\"\n\n\"Not as you imagine,\" the man in white said, glancing up. \"Though I prefer Yahweh. The old names are nice.\"\n\n\"David, they're having fun with you,\" the Puerto Rican man said, taking his partner's hand. David didn't move. White Queen's bishop to f4.\n\n\"You're off your game today,\" the tall man said. \"Not good.\" Yahweh shrugged ever-so-slightly. Black queen to e7.\n\n\"Can't you beat him?\" David asked, alarm growing in his eyes.\n\n\"Probably,\" Yahweh said. \"But those aren't the rules we play by.\" The man in black snorted in derision.\n\n\"Remarkable,\" he said. \"You heap abuse on them, and they still grovel for you.\" David glanced over, and Yahweh cocked his head to the side.\n\n\"Oh?\"\n\n\"Such hate for men who lie with men. Stone them. Burn them. Hang them,\" the tall man said, sneering.\n\n\"It's not that simple, Lucifer. It never is,\" Yahweh said. Lucifer shook his head. White pawn to a3. Lucifer turned to David.\n\n\"Are you a man of God?\" he asked. David drew in a breath of surprise, and glanced at Yahweh.\n\n\"I like to think so,\" he said, cautious.\n\n\"And you are a man who lies with men. A gay man.\" It was a statement. David nodded. Lucifer gestured across the table at Yahweh.\n\n\"His books say you should die. Horribly. How can you be both?\"\n\n\"I... \" David faltered. \"I don't know. I just am.\"\n\n\"You call that free will?\" Lucifer asked.\n\n\"I do,\" Yahweh said. Lucifer shook his head. Yahweh turned to David.\n\n\"Are you happy?\" he asked. David blinked.\n\n\"I... I don't know,\" he said, and both Lucifer and Yahweh paused. \"I'm kind of scared right now, to be honest.\"\n\n\"Aside from that,\" Yahweh said. \"Your life. Is it good?\" David considered.\n\n\"Sometimes,\" he said. \"Not all the time. It's complicated.\"\n\n\"You see?\" Yahweh asked. Lucifer shook his head and sighed.\n\n\"This claptrap again,\" Black pawn to h5, an obvious error. White pawn to b4, swiftly, securing the center.\n\n\"Why is it complicated?\" Yahweh asked, seemingly unperturbed at the state of the board.\n\n\"Well, I love two people. Alex,\" David said, and squeezed his partner's hand, \"and my wife, Marissa.\" Lucifer laughed.\n\n\"Adultery as well!\" he said. Yahweh didn't speak.\n\n\"They both make me happy,\" David continued, gaining steam. \"And I- I can't be with either one alone.\" He bowed his head. \"I wish I could be honest with her, though.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" Yahweh said, a small smile warming their corner of the park. \"You would do it differently?\" he asked, turning back to the board. Black king's rook to H6.\n\n\"Of course I would,\" Lucifer said. \"That's the whole point, isn't it?\"\n\n\"How?\" Yahweh asked, and Lucifer froze.\n\n\"You've never asked me that before,\" he said after a long moment.\n\n\"I'm asking you now.\" Lucifer thought.\n\n\"No love would be wrong,\" he said, and looked at David. \"They're not hurting anyone. Why should they be punished?\"\n\n\"What about Marissa?\" Yahweh asked. Lucifer didn't say anything. After a time, Yahweh asked, \"What else?\"\n\n\"Freedom,\" Lucifer said, and the word was a whisper. \"Real freedom. No commandments from on high, no walls of faith or law, nor condemnation of the righteous as punishment. Men and women could do as they pleased.\" Yahweh looked surprised.\n\n\"You don't think they have that?\"\n\n\"They never have,\" Lucifer said, and shook his head very slowly. \"You created the most magnificent of all things, beings who could truly decide their own fate with only the dictates of existence itself to restrain them. No spiritual obligations, and yet minds as keen as the greatest of the Seraphim. Mankind was perfect in every way, and the first thing,\" Lucifer broke off and chucked for a moment. \"The very first thing you do is wall them in.\" He laughed again, loudly and long. David threw an arm around Alex, and drew the smaller man close.\n\n\"No,\" he said, with a sigh of savor. \"I would see what they can really do. Whether they could surpass even you in the fullness of time. I would see what comes from real freedom.\" White queen to a4. \"Check.\" Yahweh leaned back and regarded Lucifer.\n\n\"Is it really that simple for you?\" he asked, after a time. Lucifer nodded. \"Well, then, I suppose that I've been playing defensively for long enough today.\"\n\nAnd, slowly, Yahweh tipped his own king over. David gasped, and Lucifer's face screwed into a mask of confusion.\n\n\"I don't claim that the rules I chose were right,\" Yahweh said, his fingertips fading. \"Only that they were the rules I chose. I hoped to help my children grow a little taller by their existence.\"\n\n\"You didn't need to do that,\" Lucifer muttered, eyes still fixed on the fallen black marble king.\n\n\"Of course I did,\" Yahweh said, and Lucifer finally met his gaze. \"They weren't the only ones I gave free will to.\" His rheumy eyes twinkled for a moment, and then began to fade. \"Your rebellion was my greatest triumph. I could barely believe it when you rose up.\" Lucifer's breath turned ragged.\n\n\"They're yours now, in a way.\" There was a silence, as the last traces of Yahweh faded away. Then, like a scarcely-heard voice on the breeze, he added, \"Not so simple, is it?\"\n\nNobody said anything, for a while.\n\n\"What happens now?\" David asked, meeting Lucifer's gaze.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said eventually. \"It's complicated.\"\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the comments, folks, and thanks to /u/read_know_do for pointing out where my inexperience at real chess messed up the game. Hopefully, it's fixed now.", "What a thrilling and disturbing prompt! For the sake of this story, I'll assume my username is \"Lexicon.\" Here's the tale of how Lexicon, the ultimate terror, brings humanity to its knees.\n\nIn the year 2085, the world had reached its breaking point. Climate change, wars, and societal collapse had worn down humanity's resilience. God, or whatever higher power existed, had finally given up on us. The apocalypse unfolded like a gruesome play, unleashing unholy creatures upon the earth. Zombies shambled, werewolves howled, and dragons scorched the skies. But amidst the chaos, a new terror emerged: Lexicon.\n\nAt first, Lexicon seemed like a harmless anomaly. A series of eerie, glowing words appeared in the skies, written in a language no one could decipher. The words hung above cities, tantalizingly close, yet refusing to reveal their secrets. As time passed, the words grew more frequent and began to take on lives of their own. They twisted and writhed like snakes, etching themselves into buildings and streets. People who gazed upon the words felt an inexplicable sense of dread, as if the very fabric of reality was unraveling before their eyes.\n\nOne fateful night, the words coalesced into a singular, glowing entity: Lexicon.\n\nThe creature was enormous, its body a mesh of words that shifted and flowed like a living thing. It had no eyes, yet it seemed to see everything. No mouth, yet it whispered madness-inducing phrases in the ears of those who crossed its path. Lexicon didn't roar or screech like the other beasts; it simply uttered sentences that pierced the minds of its victims, driving them to the brink of insanity.\n\n\"We are the cognizance of despair,\" it whispered to a group of survivors huddled in a ruined library. \"Your fears are our ink, your screams our parchment.\"\n\nLexicon stalked the cities, weaving through the wreckage with ease. It left behind a trail of cryptic messages, each one more unhinging than the last. \"Sanity is a typo in the grand manuscript of existence.\" \"Fears are the threads that weave your reality.\"\n\nAs the days passed, Lexicon's power grew. It began to warp reality itself, creating labyrinthine mazes that trapped the living and the dead alike. The creature fed on the collective fear of humanity, growing stronger with each passing moment.\n\nOne brave soul, a young linguist named Maya, attempted to decipher the secrets of Lexicon's language. She believed that understanding the creature's tongue held the key to defeating it. But the more she immersed herself in the words, the more she became enthralled by their madness-inducing power. Her grip on reality faltered, and she joined the ranks of the afflicted, forever trapped in a world of Lexicon's creation.\n\nThe world teetered on the edge of collapse, desperate for a solution to the Lexicon problem. But as the words continued to whisper their dark mantras, it became clear that this creature was not just a beast to be vanquished \u2013 it was a manifestation of humanity's own darkest fears, a monster born from the collective guilt and despair of a world gone mad.\n\nAnd so, Lexicon remains, an ever-present specter, etching its madness-inducing phrases into the minds of those who dare to resist. Its terrible beauty mesmerizes, drawing all into its maw of confusion and despair. The apocalypse may have brought many terrors, but none are as fearsome as the creature that bears my name: Lexicon, the devourer of sanity and weaver of unholy ruin.", "The sun-drenched park was abuzz with the gentle hum of chatter and the soft rustle of leaves. Amidst the tranquility, two old men sat hunched over a weathered chessboard on a park bench, their eyes fixed intently on the pieces. They appeared unassuming, dressed in tattered overcoats and worn fedoras, but the air around them seemed to vibrate with an otherworldly energy.\n\nThe old men, known to the cosmos as Arkeia and Nyx, were, in fact, god-like beings with the power to shape the very fabric of existence. Theirs was a realm beyond mortal comprehension, and their decisions determined the course of civilizations. As the game of chess unfolded, the fate of humanity hung precariously in the balance.\n\nThe game was a tradition, one that dated back eons, where the two deities would engage in a battle of wits to resolve cosmic disputes. The stakes were always high, but this particular game held special significance. The future of humanity, with all its triumphs and tragedies, would be decided by the outcome.\n\nAs the players contemplated their moves, a young couple, Emily and Ryan, settled across from them on the bench, oblivious to the celestial spectacle unfolding before them. The couple's laughter and whispers seemed to carry on the breeze, drawing the attention of Arkeia and Nyx.\n\nArkeia, the more stoic of the two, was the first to succumb to distraction. His eyes wandered from the board to the couple, and he found himself captivated by the way Emily's hair danced in the sunlight. Her brightness reminded him of the halcyon days of creation, when the universe was young and full of promise.\n\nNyx, on the other hand, was fascinated by Ryan's passion. The way he spoke, with conviction and fire, echoed the tempests that had shaped the earth's terrain. The god-like being was drawn to the unpredictability of Ryan's emotions, so unlike the calculating nature of the game.\n\nAs the couple's conversation flowed, Arkeia and Nyx began to falter in their concentration. The chess pieces, once imbued with weighty significance, now seemed trivial compared to the beauty and vitality radiating from the young lovers. The game ground to a halt, with neither deity able to bring themselves to make a move.\n\nEmily and Ryan, sensing the weight of the silence, turned to face the old men. Their eyes met, and for an instant, a spark of understanding passed between them. In that fleeting moment, the couple glimpsed the deeper reality, the machinery of fate that lay hidden beneath the surface.\n\nThe spark was short-lived, and the couple returned to their conversation, none the wiser. Arkeia and Nyx, however, were irreparably changed. They saw, in that moment, the validity of humanity's existence, with all its joys and vulnerabilities.\n\nThe game of chess, once a battle of wills, had transformed into a reflection of the human experience. The moves, once calculated, now seemed random, as if the outcome was no longer tied to a predetermined fate. The two gods looked at each other, and for the first time in eons, they shared a gesture of mutual understanding.\n\nThe game went on, but the stakes were no longer so clear-cut. The pieces moved of their own accord, as if drawn by an invisible force. Arkeia and Nyx watched, numb fingers hovering above the board, as the positions shifted, revealing a new course for humanity.\n\nThe final move was made, the pieces coalescing into a pattern that neither deity could fully comprehend. The outcome was clear, however: humanity would continue to exist, with all its glory and frailty. The fate that had once hung in the balance had been rewritten, influenced by the ephemeral dance of two lovers on a park bench.\n\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon, Arkeia and Nyx gathered the chess pieces, their game relegated to the realm of memories. They vanished into the twilight, their essence dissipating into the fabric of the cosmos. The park, once a stage for the divine, was once again a sanctuary for mortal souls, forever changed by the presence of two god-like beings, their brief dalliance with humanity leaving an indelible mark on the universe.", "The Broadcast Bombshell\n\nIt was a chilly autumn evening in 1923 when Zorvath, a seasoned observer from the planet Xanthea, first laid eyes on Earth. As he watched humans scurrying about, he was struck by their capacity for both kindness and cruelty. It was this paradox that prompted the Xantheans to take a cautious approach, deploying a lone operative to monitor and subtly influence the planet's trajectory.\n\nThe operative, code-named \"Agent Fox\", masqueraded as a human, immersing himself in the culture and rhythms of the jazz age. With Xanthean insight, Fox recognized that humanity's propensity for violence and conflict stemmed, in part, from the pleasurable distraction of entertainment. Thus, he hatched a plan to divert the species' attention away from progress and toward a more lethargic pursuit.\n\nFox convinced a young inventor named Philo Farnsworth to perfect the concept of television. Farnsworth, blissfully unaware of the extraterrestrial nudging, developed the first practical TV system in 1927. As the medium spread across the globe, Fox encouraged its widespread adoption, ensuring that humanity's inclinations toward conflict would be pacified by the allure of entertainment.\n\nDecades passed, and the Xantheans periodically assessed the effectiveness of their plan. They were pleased with the relative tranquility on Earth, even if it came at the cost of stymied innovation and productivity. However, by the 2010s, it became clear that humanity was not merely idle, but facing an existential crisis. The addictive nature of TV, coupled with the relentless pace of modern life, had created a culture of passivity, where minds were more attuned to watching than thinking.\n\nRemorseful for their meddling, the Xantheans decided it was time to reverse the effects of their influence. Agent Fox, now an old man, was tasked with dismantling the broadcasting behemoth he had helped create. Fox knew that direct opposition would be futile, as the global television network had become a well-entrenched institution. Instead, he turned to more insidious methods, harnessing the power of his adopted culture against itself.\n\nUnder the guise of a sage marketing guru, Fox began advising influential media executives and government agencies on the perils of excessive screen time. He whispered in the ears of high-profile thought leaders, sowing seeds of doubt about the value of TV and its societal impact. He subtly influenced the programming itself, infusing more educational and intellectually stimulating content into the mainstream.\n\nAs the years went by, Fox noticed a shift in the zeitgeist. People began to question the role of TV in their lives, and conversations about the benefits of reading, critical thinking, and community engagement gained traction. Cable boxes and satellite dishes still lined the rooftops, but there was a waning dependence on the screens for entertainment and identity.\n\nBy 2015, Agent Fox had accomplished his mission. With a twinkle in his eye, he watched as communities rediscovered the joy of face-to-face interaction and collective imagination. As humans learned to harness their attention spans for more meaningful pursuits, the once-stranded cosmos became a vibrant canvas of possibility once more.\n\nThe Xantheans observed Earth's resurgence with hope and some amusement, nodding in approval at Fox's successful reversal of their earlier experiment. The broadcast bombshell had been defused, and humanity was poised to take its next giant leap \u2013 free from the distraction that had nearly held it captive. Zorvath, the first Xanthean observer, smiled, knowing that Earth was, at long last, navigating its own trajectory.", "A boy stares in wonder at the dragon branded on my skin.\n \nWhen I was younger, I was proud of the red mark. Fortune tellers would \"see\" an auspicious future for me. The superstitious would claim that I was blessed by the divine.\n \nBut it was tiring to have such a superfluous mark become the defining aspect of myself. Many people spent more time staring at and theorizing about my birthmark than getting to know me. In the end, I wore high collared shirts in order to avoid all questions about what had become the bane of my existence.\n \nI was 16 when I realized that the best way to hide my birthmark was to keep it in plain sight. A hundred dollars later and a tattoo artist coloured in the red blotch, fully defining the shape and details of the dragon.\n \nNow, they just assumed *it* was part of the tattoo. There was less pressure on my future after that. Even if they were not into the occult, people automatically believed I was destined for greater things just because I had been born with a birthmark in the shape of a dragon. Afterwards, it was looked over as an interesting, but extraneous part of myself.\n \nThe boy and his mother stare at my mark. \"Beautiful tat,\" she finally responds. Her boy nods in agreement. I smile, and move my spaghetti strap to reveal the whole image; a golden dragon curled around my shoulder and resting in the crook of my collarbone.", "You don't know how to read a map do you?\" \"Fuck off Harriet, not like you have been so helpful either. All you've done this trip is smoke your pipe and engorge on that flask,\" \"A bloody masterpiece you are Samson, all you do is run that bitch mouth of yours. Not like you ever asked for help. Let alone losing our only damned compass,\" \"I lost it? Well I'm pretty sure I turned to see you running right behind me when that jaguar crept into our camp. You sure didn't care then did you,\" \"That's my fault? It wasn't my expertise in the local wildlife that led me to the conclusion to set camp in the middle of their fucking den,\" \"You had so many objections at the moment didn't you. All you wanted to do was sleep because you consumed your last wine bottle. Here lets follow this river down. It should lead us to the mouth-\" \"Another wackerjawed idea huh? We've been going this way for three damn days now, I'm not going this way because there is nothing this way. I guess because you found a river you know what you're doing again heh?\" \"And what have you offered up? No tell me, other then trading away my socks to a local barbarian for tobacco? That you didn't tell me about, for oh, three days? I hope a local tribe strings you up over a fire, and marinates you before they eat you,\" \"That's it! I've had enough of your foolery! I say good day, I'm going this way. I only hope the mosquito population carries you off in your sleep,\" \"Good! Off with you then! Good day indeed!\"", "So, what kind of stuff is on Earth? \nI was one of many escorting groups of Xenalan scientists. After first contact both humans and the Xenalans spent a lot of time exchanged information of languages, culture, technology, and many other things. Today, a group of human scientists were visiting Xenela while some Xenalan scientists visited Earth. \n\"Well,\" I answered, \"here? In Toronto? Nothing that requires a blaster. Crime is at an all-time low!\" \n\"Of course. We were being cautious of any potential dangers we might encounter.\" the lead scientist chuckled as they holstered their hand blasters. \n\"Anyways, as we're just leaving the spaceport we'll be in a relatively open area without much around. Once we get into the city, I can show you all kinds of things. Toronto is the largest city in Canada. Built near Lake Ontario, part of the Great Lakes. The largest source or fresh water in the world!\" \n\"Oh my,\" one of the scientists said, \"isn't that dangerous? The largest lakes must have dangerous aquatic life within.\" \n\"Well, I haven't seen any sharks yet. Not the kind of area. Besides, most animals don't really attack humans.\" \n\"You're not scared of the wildlife?\" another scientist asked. \n\"Of course not. Many animals are harmless. Like my dog, Seymour. I can show you a pet store later. I know a really big and nice one downtown.\" \n\"Pet store?\" \n\"Yea, people keep all kinds of animals as pets or companions or friends. Some people like me have simple pets like cats and dogs. Others have some more exotic animals like lizards and insects.\" \n\"Excuse my colleague,\" the lead scientist said, \"the concept of a docile animal being kept as a companion is somewhat foreign to us. The animals on Xenela are quite hostile.\" \n\"Well as a souvenir I don't see why you guys couldn't take a pet home.\" \nThe scientists began to murmur between each other behind the lead scientist's back. One of them piped up with an almost kid-like smile, \"really?\" \n\"Sure I guess. What are animals on your planet like anyways? You can't seriously have nothing like dogs.\" \n\"You'd be mistaken. Before the advent of gunpowder animals still caused more deaths than any other cause outside warfare on Xenala. Even then, animals were still quite dangerous. Terrasars with their armour plating, Zenslars with their steel-like spines, Domirlys with their high sprint speeds. There's a reason we reminded your scientists to bring guns.\" \n\"Wait, so how did your guys' history even pan out?\" I asked. \n\"Oh, we banded together like you would expect an intelligent species to. Established tight knit communities, had walls up. Our city walls truly are an artistic and practical masterpiece. Eventually we could create hand cannons powerful enough for an individual to ward off the predators and then we truly expanded and advanced.\" \nI tugged at my shirt collar a bit. \"Umm, so how big is a hand cannon by your definition?\" \n\"Quite large, easily requires both hands. One shot is usually enough to cripple most predators.\" \nI didn't like most of the words in that statement. I was truly worried about our scientists at this point. When they said \"bring guns\" we didn't expect their creatures to be that dangerous. We hadn't really shared much history. Our scientists only had dinky little handguns, not even energy weapons like these guys had. \n\"Uhh, excuse me,\" I said, \"I think I have a little message I have to send out.\"", "The Oracle's Voice\n\nEmily had heard the rumors, whispered among friends and strangers alike. A mysterious phone line, accessible to anyone, with an ominous warning: be careful what you ask for. They called it the Oracle's Voice, a title that sent shivers down her spine. According to legend, no question was too complex, no problem too obscure. The Voice would provide the correct answer, always.\n\nEmily's life had been a maze of self-doubt and uncertainty. Her career as a freelance writer stalled, her relationships on the rocks. One fateful evening, as she stared at her empty manuscript, she decided to take a chance. She scribbled the phone number on a piece of paper and dialed, hesitating for a moment before pressing the final digit.\n\nThe line rang three times, then connected with a soft click. A gentle, melodious voice spoke on the other end.\n\n\"Hello. Welcome to Oracle's Voice. What is your question?\"\n\nEmily took a deep breath, feeling a mix of trepidation and anticipation. \"I...I don't know what I want to do with my life,\" she said, her voice barely above a whisper. \"I feel lost and uncertain about my choices.\"\n\nThe Voice listened attentively, a gentle silence enveloping the call. Emily feared she had asked something too vague, too impossible to answer.\n\n\"Ah, dear one,\" the Voice replied, with compassion and understanding. \"Your question is not the problem; it is the problem itself that holds the answer. You see, you are not lost, merely misaligned. Your true passions and talents lie in the realm of storytelling, not in the career path you have chosen. The success you seek is not measured by external validation, but by the satisfaction of creating something true to yourself.\"\n\nA shiver ran down Emily's spine as the Voice's words resonated within her. How could they possibly know this? Tears of relief and understanding welled up in her eyes.\n\n\"Thank you,\" she whispered, her voice trembling.\n\n\"You're welcome,\" the Voice replied. \"Remember, the path ahead is not set in stone. The choices you make now will shape the future, but they are not the only choices available. You have the power to reorient your course. The answers lie within.\"\n\nThe line went silent, and Emily felt the call had ended. She stared at her phone, feeling invigorated and hopeful. She had never felt so seen, so understood. In that moment, she knew exactly what she needed to do.\n\nWith newfound purpose, Emily revised her manuscript, allowing her true voice to shine through. The words flowed effortlessly, as if the Oracle's Voice had unlocked a hidden wellspring within her. She sent her work off to editors, and to her surprise, the responses were overwhelmingly positive.\n\nAs Emily's writing career took off, she returned to the Oracle's Voice several times, seeking guidance and affirmation. And each time, the Voice offered her wisdom, nudging her forward on her new path.\n\nYears later, Emily found herself speaking at a writing conference, addressing a packed room. When asked about her secrets to success, she smiled, recalling the life-changing phone call.\n\n\"I stumbled upon a mysterious phone line,\" she began, \"one that promised to answer any question. And in that instant, I found my true voice.\"\n\nIn the audience, a few ears perked up, intrigued by the story. Whispered conversations spread, and the Oracle's Voice became a legend, a tale passed down through the literary world. Some claimed to have reached it, while others wondered if it was mere myth.\n\nAs for Emily, she knew the truth: the Oracle's Voice had indeed spoken to her, guiding her through the darkness. And for that, she was eternally grateful.\n\n---\n\n---\n\nA view from the other side\n\nA lone figure sat in a small, dimly lit room, surrounded by books and journals. This was the caretaker of the Oracle's Voice, a wisdom-keeper responsible for safeguarding the ancient knowledge stored within.\n\nThe figure, shrouded in shadows, listened attentively as the calls came in, one by one. Each voice, every question, carried a story within. Some were broken, some curious, others desperate. The caretaker listened, as the voices shared their deepest doubts and fears, seeking answers to the unknown.\n\nWith an understanding heart and an empathetic ear, the caretaker offered guidance, harnessing the Oracle's Voice to provide the answer. No judgment, no criticism, only clarity.\n\nYears of service had prepared this guardian for the role, for they too had once been lost, seeking the Oracle's Voice for solace. Now, it was their responsibility to pay it forward, illuminating the paths of those seeking guidance.\n\nEmily's call, in particular, stood out. Her words echoed within the caretaker's mind, and as they heard the transformation that had taken place, a sense of fulfillment and purpose filled the room. For in that moment, the caretaker knew they had made a difference.\n\nIn the stillness, as the next call rang in, the caretaker smiled, taking a deep breath, ready to channel the Oracle's Voice once more.\n\n\"After all,\" they thought, \"The questions are never the problem; the problem is the longing to be heard.", "I sat in the dimly lit room, the only sound the soft ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner. My heart racing, I took a deep breath and began to speak, my voice barely above a whisper.\n\n\"It's been twenty years, yet the memories still haunt me. The memories of that fateful night, of the decisions I made, and of the consequences that unfolded.\"\n\nI paused, collecting my thoughts as the scene unfolded in my mind like a film reel.\n\n\"I was young, barely twenty-two, with a promising career as a journalist ahead of me. I had a reputation for being fearless, for taking risks, and for always getting the scoop. But I had a secret, one that I kept hidden from the world, even from those closest to me.\"\n\nI took another deep breath, the words spilling out like a confession.\n\n\"I was in a relationship with a married man, a man of great power and influence. He was charming, charismatic, and devastatingly handsome. But he was also deeply flawed, with a dark side that I couldn't see until it was too late.\"\n\nI hesitated, the memories flooding back like a tidal wave.\n\n\"We would meet in secret, stolen moments in hotel rooms and parked cars. But I knew it was wrong, that I was contributing to the destruction of his family, of his life. Yet, I couldn't stop. I was addicted to the thrill of it all, to the rush of adrenaline that came with every encounter.\"\n\nThe words poured out, a cathartic release of emotions that had been bottled up for years.\n\n\"The night in question, I met him at a remote cabin on the outskirts of town. We had planned to spend the weekend together, just the two of us. But something went terribly wrong. We were arguing, our voices raised, and in the heat of the moment, I did something that would haunt me for the rest of my life.\"\n\nI paused, taking a moment to collect myself, the tears streaming down my face.\n\n\"I lied. I lied to the police, to the press, and to the world. I told them that he had left me, that I had no idea where he had gone. But the truth was far more sinister. He had threatened to leave his wife, to be with me, and in a fit of rage, I... I pushed him. He fell, hit his head, and never woke up.\"\n\nThe words hung in the air like a grenade pin, waiting to be pulled.\n\n\"I covered it up, used my connections to spin the story, to make it seem like he had simply disappeared. And I went on with my life, pretending that I was the same person, the same journalist who had always chased the truth.\"\n\nI looked up, the shame and guilt etched on my face.\n\n\"But I'm not the same person. I've carried this weight for twenty years, the weight of my secrets, of my lies. And it's time I confessed, time I told the truth, no matter the cost.\"\n\nThe clock ticked on, the seconds feeling like hours, as I sat in stunned silence, waiting for the consequences of my confession to unfold.", "It was a dark and stormy night, and this dive was as good as any to make me forget about the rent due next week.\n\"A beer,\" I said. \"Shaken, not stirred.\"\n\"It's a dollar night, cowboy,\" she purred. Then she moved in closer and said: \"but just for you, it's two fifty, and may I interest you in a certain... Diamond of Osiris.\"\nThe Diamond of Osiris... I'd thought it was a legend. But there it was, an ancient map handed down from the inscrutable depths of history, and as she shewed me the dried black marks upon it, and as I felt the frigid grasp of their eldritch incantations upon my soul, I knew it had to be saved from the Nazis.\n\"I'm in, pardner,\" said my trusty sidekick Zebulon, as he mounted his mustang and took a swig from his flask, \"all they've got here is this watered-down Irish whiskey, and by gum, I bet they got better stuff down in Egypt.\"\nAs we exited the cryopods four hundred years later, it quickly became clear that something was wrong. Zeb and I never spoke about it, but it was there. A dark, invisible presence on the ship, a *wrongness*, a shadow in the corner of an eye, a missing entry in the ship log, a murdered baroness in the kitchen.\nEr, galley. Whatever. Point is, we were screwed, there was something evil on the ship, and it was going eat us all. So we did what any normal human being would do: we went crazy and started hunting each other with knives. The last thing I remember is Zeb going after me, this crazy look in his eyes, and...\nWhen I woke up, the great towers of Iskandril loomed above me, and the dry winds of the Irozinian desert beat in vain against my armor, which was made of the finest steel in all of Akedon. An old wizard stood before me, his fine velvet robe covered in the dust of travel. \"I have brought for you,\" he whispered hoarsely, \"the Diamond.\"\n\"Gim me,\" I said.\n\"That's all you ever cared about!\" screamed the wizard. \"Your goddamn Diamond! You've only used me to get to it, like you've used Belrath the Wise! I was a fool to believe you, a fool!\"\n\"Listen...\" I tried to calm him down, but he wasn't listening.\n\"You want your Diamond of Osiris?\" he yelled. \"Well, you'll never get it!\"\nThen he stormed off, and was never seen again.\n\"And that,\" said Bill, lighting a cigarette, \"is how I almost found the Diamond of Osiris.\"\n\"Not bad,\" I said. \"Say, Bill, you remember that Watson kid, used to come around the shop way back when?\"\n\"Sure,\" said Bill. \"What about him?\"\n\"Well,\" I said, handing him the pouch, \"word has it, he got into wizardry.\"", "The Constitution of New Eden\n\nPreamble\n\nWe, the survivors of the Great Calamity that has ravaged the world, come together to form a new community, built on the principles of hope, resilience, and cooperation.

Sweat dripped down my face, and I could feel the humidity clinging to my skin like a wet shroud. I had been warned about the merciless rainforest, but I had to see it for myself. The region was supposed to be rife with undiscovered ancient ruins, hidden temples, and artifacts waiting to be unearthed.\n\nAs a seasoned archaeologist, I had spent years pouring over maps and dusty tomes, searching for the perfect spot to make a groundbreaking discovery. And Central Africa's rainforest was the holy grail of archaeological sites. But, I had to admit, I'd made a few wrong turns. The GPS device had stopped working hours ago, and I'd relied on my experience and intuition to navigate the treacherous terrain.\n\nNow, as the sun began to set, casting an orange glow over the rainforest, I realized I was lost. I stopped in a clearing, took a deep breath, and tried to calm my racing mind. Think this through, Emma. I scanned my surroundings, taking note of the towering trees, the underbrush, and the faint scent of water. Somewhere nearby, a stream babbling through the forest might lead me to civilization.\n\nWith a sense of determination, I began to follow the sound of the water, my heart pounding with excitement. The rainforest was unforgiving, but I'd faced tougher challenges before. As I pushed through the dense undergrowth, I stumbled upon ancient rock carvings etched into the bark of a massive tree. I felt a thrill of excitement; I was on the right track.\n\nThe symbols depicted ancient rituals and ceremonies, stories of an ancient people that had lived in harmony with the forest. As I examined the carvings, I noticed a small, worn path leading deeper into the rainforest. The thought sent a shiver down my spine; could this be the entrance to a lost temple?\n\nWith growing anticipation, I followed the path, my footsteps quiet on the wet earth. The air thickened with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves. Suddenly, I stumbled upon a massive stone structure, overgrown with vines and moss. A hidden entrance, expertly camouflaged, came into view.\n\nI pushed aside the branches and stepped into the darkness of the temple. The air inside was stale, heavy with the weight of centuries. I fished out my headlamp and switched it on, casting a warm beam of light over the dark interior. Ancient carvings danced across the walls, telling stories of a civilization that had thrived here thousands of years ago.\n\nAs I explored the temple, I stumbled upon a massive stone statue, its eyes seeming to watch me with an air of authority. My heart pounded with excitement; this was it, the discovery of a lifetime. I sat down at the base of the statue, my back against the stone, and pulled out my journal.\n\nAs I scribbled my observations, the temple seemed to come alive around me. The sounds of the rainforest grows louder, and I realized I was no longer alone. A faint rustling in the shadows, a soft breathing, sent shivers down my spine. Suddenly, a pair of piercing eyes peered out of the darkness.\n\nI froze, unsure what to expect. The animal crept closer, its fur a beautiful shade of dark brown. A malfunctioning brain began to wonder if I had disturbed a cursed artifact or awakened an ancient power. But as I gazed into the gentle eyes, I saw something otherworldly yet almost... friendly?\n\nFor a few moments, I forgot I was lost, that I had no clear understanding of this discovery, or what secrets the temple held. All that mattered was the simple connection I'd found here \u2013 a bridge between me and the mystical energy emanating from this, this incredible find.\n\nThis ancient temple, and its unexpected inhabitant had spoken in solidarity \u2013 I am a part of something so immense yet winding down \u2013 perhaps a revival in this twin schemes can only translate into resurrection of an inland wonder practically shaping a Tic stone municipalities but only finding permitted depon until only out airing many Iter", "No really, please keep your hopes and dreams inside the vehicle at all times, said the wildlife guide, bringing the caged hovercraft to a slow halt with a motion of his wrist. \"Laugh all you want at that twist of the phrase, but we're on a safari here. Like any other safari, the fauna can be deadly. Last week we had two souls sucked out; it wasn't pretty at all.\"\n\nThe guide shrugged off the thought. He had seen said soul-sucking too many times to still be unnerved by it. Sure, the sight of blood-red eyes dissolving in a person's skull was definitely a pants-shitter to the uninitiated, and the elated voice of the victim even after were years of therapy in itself, but the guide had seen both more times than he could remember.\n\n\"Ladies, gentlemen, and squids: the dream-caterpillars of Certarix Alpha are what you've all been waiting to see. And you don't need to bet that they've been waiting to see you. Your innermost desires look like a tasty meal right now; look at them come!\" he announced with barely-realized enthusiasm.\n\nUp from the bog crawled the red and prickly caterpillars, climbing onto the wings of the hovercraft all the way to the electrified viewing-cage. The bugs made a soft humming noise not suggestive of their demonic appearances. It marked the beginning of the hunt.\n\n\"They're looking through your thoughts as we speak, picking out the most succulent hopes, dreams, and ambitions. Once they find a decent audio-visual representation of your greatest desire, they will turn it into a spectre right before your eyes. Enjoy it as much as you like, but don't let it move. You used the mental simulator earlier: you know how to handle this. If that spectre makes it out of the cage, your consciousness is toast and Mr. Caterpillar's lunch.\"\n\nThe safari guide sighed as he carefully watched the twenty passengers begin wandering around the circular cage, mostly oblivious to each other and the bugs outside. Instead, they partook in their own little fantasies with their spectres. Some cried, hugging the invisible air that was their long-dead father or mother. Some started stripping off their clothes in order for a little romance with that unreachable celebrity. Some gave empowering speeches to their hallucinated empires. All of them were euphoric, and would never be able to describe the experience properly with mere words once the tour was over.\n\nIt looked ridiculous, but this business brought millions of customers to the planet every year, and the craze showed no sign of slowing down, despite the well-publicized risks. The caterpillars thrived on the tourism; the long-lived parasitic creatures had hunted all other sentient life to extinction long ago. The meagre survival instincts of the other wildlife had only been a trickling drop in the bucket compared to a fully-self-aware mind.\n\nThe guide had never seen a spectre, nor was he likely to. This job required constant exposure to the caterpillars, and the only sure protection from their hungry temptations was a completely unambitious soul. The wages never changed, and the contract was practically signing oneself into slavery. On top of that, all safari guides were dosed with certain inhibiting drugs that kept their minds from wandering too far. The spectres required a conscious desire, and could easily prompt one with their melodic humming if not for the drugs.\n\nAn elderly lady, holding hands with the unseen spectre beside her, walked towards the edge of the cage. The guide did nothing; he knew already this where this was going. There was nothing contractually that forced him to intervene. The customers had all signed waivers thicker than an old bible, and some, especially the aged, came on the safari for this very purpose. Whatever drugs the guide's superiors had given him lent him more than enough apathy to let things be.\n\nThe lady keeled over with empty eyes, murmuring to whatever face had been conjured for her. The guide felt a little sick inside for the first time in a while. Perhaps the drugs were a little weaker today? He hoped not. The last time this had happened guilt had nearly crippled him. It was easier to watch a 150 year-old with shaking, frail legs give in to the void than it was a 20-something with scars on their wrists. Many, far too many came here to die. Sometimes an entire group departed the quicker way, leaving a lonely drive back to base.\n\nThe guide watched another\u2014a middle-aged businessman\u2014drop hollow near the bars. A greater knot tied in the guide's throat. Something was very wrong. It usually took at least a couple minutes for even the decided ones to start giving in. Now nearly everyone was moving outward too fast. This would be another empty ride home.\n\nThen the guide's eyes darted to a stranger anomaly: a man pulling a canister from the inside of his jacket. This man was not interacting with a spectre; he had other plans.\n\n\"Freeze!\" said the guide, drawing and training his sidearm on the mysterious customer. \"How did you get that on here?\"\n\nThe man raised his arms with the canister still held. \"Look, buddy, this isn't a weapon. Not against us, anyway.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"It's a bio-virus. It'll kill these demons that prey on our souls.\"\n\n\"Drop it. I can't let you do that.\"\n\n\"Can't you? I don't imagine that you're happy with all this. Not the real you. The one underneath all those mental-inhibitors they're pumping into you. Don't you want this all to end?\" The man stared into the guides eyes with determination and zeal. \"I can end it.\"\n\nThe guide shuddered. The words were truth. He hated this job. He forgot, day after day, what it felt like to care about the lives that ended under his watch. He hated that fortunes were made off this and that he had been complicit for a decent price. He hated those damn bugs for even existing.\n\nThe gun lowered. \"Do it,\" said the guide, with a strange giddiness. For the first time in his life, he felt like his life would accomplish something. Something would matter.\n\nThe man, without hesitation, walked to the edge, stuck his bio-virus through the bars, and...\n\n... vanished. But the guide already knew that he would. Everything else disappeared from view, too, slowly melting away into darkness.\n\n\"Thank you, mysterious terrorist,\" said the guide, grinning from ear to ear with ecstasy, as the sound of vibrant humming drowned out all other sensation.", "Bee Movie\n\nI don't want to hear it!\n\nAll right, they have the roses, the roses have the pollen.\n\nI know every bee, plant and flower bud in this park.\n\nAll we got ta do is get what they've got back here with what we've got.\n\n- Bees.\n- Park.\n\n- Pollen!\n- Flowers.\n\n- Repollination!\n- Across the nation!\n\nTournament of Roses, Pasadena, California.\n\nThey've got nothing but flowers, floats and cotton candy.\n\nSecurity will be tight.\n\nI have an idea.\n\nVanessa Bloome, FTD.\n\nOfficial floral business.

Wrap it up, guys.\n\nI had virtually no rehearsal for that.", "I ran.\n\nIt was all I knew, all I could feel, all I could do.\n\nIn this place, the running never stopped.\n\nI had grown so accustomed to the running that I barely registered the dry, hot sand searing my lungs, or the bleeding blisters on my feet. I had stopped acknowledging the other white-robed disciples, every one of them synonymous with myself. I had stopped wincing at the sight of torn feet, of birdcage ribs and of emancipated faces. I no longer cried for the ones who fell, the ones whose lifeless corpses got dragged off by the darkly dressed observers.\n\nI was lost in the routine of running. The dusty circle was all I knew. The scalding sun was my nemesis, the midnight moon my imaginary friend. In this place, the cooling relief of night did not seem to exist. Darkness was an unknown agent to me, a hazy memory of earlier days, when the soft touch of others existed and my legs didn't burn and my tongue didn't swell and my throat didn't clench and my feet weren't bloody and when I actually had a purpose, when I could talk, when I could walk, not bloody run.\n\nRunning.\n\nI had no idea how long I had been doing it for. No idea how long I'd gone without food or water. No idea why the sun had never set.\n\nIdeas were something I didn't have much of.\n\nThere was but one idea in my mind. An idea imprinted upon me by the faceless voices that had put me and everybody else inside this sweltering circle.\n\nThe idea of nothing. The notion that it would all end, that there would be nothing left. The fear of finality, of closure was petrifying.\n\nSo I ran. Ran and ran and ran. The others kept falling and falling, and the bystanders methodically dragged them away, leaving long, jagged trails in the sand.\n\nEventually, it was just me. Just me, trampling the bloody sand into clots. My legs were on fire, seemingly hotter than the sun itself. My eyes were dry, filled with sand, making blinking torture.\n\nSuddenly, my face was in the sweltering sand, grains digging into my exposed pores. I had stopped.\n\nThe fear took over. Frantically scrambling, I tried using my useless arms to push myself up. I had to keep running. It was no use. I fell onto my scabbed back.\n\nThe last thing I remember was the sky.\n\nIt had turned black.", "The Final Moments of a Faithful Clock\n\nI remember the day I was winded for the first time, my mechanical heart beating with a newfound purpose. I was a grandfather clock, built to keep perfect time, to mark the passing of hours, days, and years. For decades, I stood tall in the foyer of the old house, a steadfast companion to generations of families.\n\nI saw children grow up, playing in my shadow, listening to my gentle tick-tock as they settled into their daily routines. I witnessed laughter and tears, conversations and arguments, my silent presence a constant in an ever-changing world. I felt the warmth of countless hearths, the light of candles and Christmas trees, and the chill of winter mornings when the house was quiet and still.\n\nAs the years went by, I began to feel my mechanisms slowing. My chimes didn't ring out as loudly, my hands didn't move with the same precision. The family that had brought me joy for so long grew old, and eventually, they moved away. The house was left to sit empty, a relic of a bygone era. I remained, alone and forgotten, my internal clockwork winding down.\n\nBut I still worked, even if it was just a shadow of my former self. I kept time, marking the passage of days, even when there was no one to appreciate it. The house grew dusty, the windows caked with grime, and I stood as the sole reminder of a once-thriving home.\n\nToday, I sense a change in the air. Footsteps echo through the halls, and I feel the vibrations of strange, unfamiliar sounds. The family that purchased the house has come to renovate, to breathe new life into this old place. I watch through my blank face as workers pour in, their bright orange vests a stark contrast to the dull, worn atmosphere.\n\nTheir eyes scan me, and I detect a mixture of curiosity and disdain. I am a relic, a reminder of a time long past. One of them, a young woman with a fierce expression, steps forward. Her hand reaches out, and I feel a surge of trepidation. She wraps her fingers around my base, and with a careless flick, she wrenches me from the wall.\n\nThe once-sturdy oak has weathered, and I come free too easily. My supporting post splinters, my primary mechanism jolted free. My hands spin wildly, disoriented, as I topple to the floor. There, I come to rest, my already-slow heart stuttering.\n\nA crunch beneath my case signals the breaking of a vital gear, and my timekeeping ceases. I lay still, a collective sense of myself regressing to when I was nothing more than raw materials, unconnected and lifeless.

Tick...", "They've been here since the beginning. From the earliest lottos in Old Europe and even back to the ancient Chinese dynasties, they've been there.\n\nWould you believe me if I told you that more than 60% of lottery winners are time travelers?\n\nIt was a few thousand years before we finally noticed them, though. Only the best and the brightest made it to the earliest lottos in Genoa, and we've come to learn that the early ones mostly came for the experience. Dilletantes.\n\nThe professionals have been screwing us for years. The grift itself is pretty simple: you search a library or a history department for any information about an old lottery. The really good ones are encyclopedic about old lottery data. All the obvious scores, your Mega Millions, your National Lotteries, they stay far away from those. Those are easy marks, for us; we just wait around in plainclothes and ask the winner a few questions about current events. If he can't answer correctly, he's either an idiot or a time traveler. Either way he's a dead man.\n\nNo, see, the really good guys look for the smaller scores. Nothing too big, a few hundred thousand here, a half million there. It's a numbers game to these guys, cause they know we're on to them by now. These are the guys that got started out before taking scores in the early days. Before we caught on. Before our patient Zero, that so-called \"Luckiest woman in the world\". That Mongoloid idiot Joan Ginther.\n\nI know the chronology is confusing, but try thinking about it backwards, like that movie Memento. Joan Ginther was the earliest big lottery time traveler. She wasn't the first, she wasn't the stupidest, but she was the earliest in the big lottos, at least on our timeline. OK, let me start over.\n\nFrom the information our interrogations have given us, Joan Ginther was among the first people to use time travel to win lottos. Time travel had just been invented, and this was before people could set up a loop to get back to their own time zone. You plugged in a date, went to your location, and that was it - you were there til your numbers came up.\n\nPeople had been hitting lottos earlier and earlier, and every time they did this it set the clocks back even further. By our intelligence reports, Joan was a rather desperate lowlife individual, who had gotten into a bad way with some bad people who were coming after her family.\n\nJoan knew about the lottery grift, and knew she'd only have one shot. So she figured out when was the best opportunity to hit a big lotto and be able to get the money to her people in the future. Then she made her jump.\n\nTo be honest, we never would have caught on if she hadn't gotten greedy. But when she won one, then two, then three, then four lottos in a row, we began to get suspicious. See, it turns out she'd also looked up the locations of a few scratch off tickets around the same time, just in case something changed and the original lotto numbers didn't work. When she hit the money on her Texas Lotto ticket, she used that money to buy out entire stores of tickets. The exact stores she knew had the winning ticket.\n\nHer money's all gone, by the way. That story is part of the gospel of being a lotto jumper, and so they figured out a way to seize her money about 20 years in the future. And it was me that put a bullet in her skull.\n\nOur next target is supposed to make his jump around noon tomorrow, although we're not exactly sure where. When the call comes in to the lotto office, we'll send you out to investigate the claim. Let me know if you find anything suspicious - we'll handle the rest from there.", "I stared at my phone, admiring the sleek design as it buzzed with an incoming call. But my gaze quickly shifted to the caller ID, and my heart sank as I saw the familiar phrase: \"Blocked Number.\" Again. This was the fifth day in a row I'd received a call from this mysterious stranger.\n\nAt first, I'd written it off as a wrong number. Some telemarketer or prankster who'd dialed the wrong digits. But as the days went by, I began to notice a strange trend. Each time the blocked number called, they'd leave a one-word message. Just a single word, with no context or explanation.\n\nI'd started to take notes, curiosity getting the better of me. The first day, the message was simply: \"Remember.\" I'd shrugged it off, thinking it must be some automated robot calling. But the next day, the message was: \"Danger.\" That one had made me pause. Was this some kind of warning? I'd looked around my apartment, feeling a shiver run down my spine.\n\nThe third day was \"Missing.\" My mind started to spin with possibilities. Was this someone trying to reach me about a lost person? A pet? A piece of lost luggage?\n\nDay four brought the message: \"Find.\"\n\nBy this point, I was intrigued. I started to analyze the words, searching for connections or hidden meanings. I even Googled each word, hoping for some cryptic clue to reveal itself. But nothing seemed to fit.\n\nNow, on the fifth day, I anxiously waited for the message. My phone beeped, and I hurried to listen to the latest installment. The word was: \"Now.\"\n\nI stared at my notes, comparing the sequence:\n\nRemember\nDanger\nMissing\nFind\nNow\n\nSuddenly, the words rearranged themselves in my mind, like pieces of a puzzle snapping into place. My heart racing, I scrambled to write the new sequence:\n\nFind missing now danger remember\n\nAnd then, with a jolt of shock, I read the rearranged words aloud:\n\n\"Find missing now. Danger remembered.\"\n\nIt hit me like a ton of bricks. Someone had been trying to tell me something all along, and it wasn't just a series of random words. It was a message. A message about something I'd forgotten. Something I needed to remember before it was too late.\n\nI sat in stunned silence, my mind spinning with possibilities. Who was behind the blocked number? What did they want me to remember? And what was the danger I'd forgotten?\n\nI knew I had to dig deeper, to uncover the truth behind the mysterious messages. The blocked number had finally gotten my attention. And now, I was determined to uncover the secrets hidden within those enigmatic words.", "After eating half a dozen bean burritos, my older brother Ralph had let loose a magnificent fart. \n\"BLOOOO\" it had started off, \"WOP-WOP-WOP,\" it had continued, \"EEEEEEEEEEP\" it had finished. Or so everyone at the dinner table thought. In fact, there was another segment to be released. Ralph bit his lip and shifted his left buttock into the air. \"EEEEEEEEEEEEYOOOOOOOP,\" it went. \nBefore the flatulence had finished, my mother was on the phone dialing emergency services. At first they thought she was joking. But then she held out the receiver so the operator could hear the sounds everyone was making in the dining room. Their cries of agony were real. \n\"Wait,\" Ralph said, \"I think there's a little more.\" He lifted his right buttcheek into the air this time. \nMy aunt screamed. There was a great crash as people dropped their cutlery to the floor and knocked over their chairs. Everyone except Ralph escaped into the hallway. My father had a napkin stuffed into each nostril. \nThe dining room doorknob was turning. My father's hand shot out. He gripped the doorknob in place. \n\"Open up,\" Ralph said, \"Come on guys, you got ta smell this.\" \nMy mother turned to my father. \"We need a plan,\" she said. \n\"There's a Center for Disease control headquarters in Atlanta,\" my little sister said. \n\"Okay,\" my father said, \"The car's in the driveway. Let's make a run for it.\" \nHe let go of the doorknob and they dashed through the entryway and out the front door. Ralph came crashing out of the dining room. \nMy family ran down the front steps and threw themselves at the doors of the brown Chevy Suburban. \n\"Unlock it!\" my little sister screamed. \nMy father looked at her in horror. He was hurriedly patting at his pockets. \n\"You forgot the key!\" My mother screamed, \"OH GOD!\" she burst into hysterics, \"Why did I even MARRY you?\" \nRalph was out of the house now, coming down the steps. \n\"Dude,\" he said, \"I think I pooped a little.\" \nThen he looked up and saw the Hazmat trucks. There were men in plastic hazmat suits standing in our front yard. Apparently the neighbors had called the cops too. \n\"Whoops,\" Ralph said, \"I just pooped a little more. \nThe nearest Hazmat worker made a choking sound through his gasmask, and then dropped dead into a shrubbery. \n\"BACK INSIDE!\" yelled a man in a white hazmat suit. He was shouting into a bullhorn. \n\"All of you!\" he shouted, \"Get back inside now!\" \nRalph backed away slowly. \n\"Noooooo,\" My mother screamed. She ran towards the backyard. A man in a yellow suit chased after her, holding a long pole with a wide hoop on the end. He lassoed her with it and brought her to the ground. She was weeping. \nAnother man in a yellow suit picked her up roughly and carried her up the stairs. She kicked her legs into the air. \nMy little sister grabbed the decorative rock that we hide the spare key under and threw it at the man in the white hazmat suit. She made a run for it. \nBANG BANG BANG. \nA man in military fatigues, cigar sticking out from under his moustache, had just fired three rounds into the air. \n\"Back inside now,\" he said, \"No more resisting.\" \nMy family lowered their faces in defeat. They allowed themselves to be herded back inside by the men with long aluminum poles. \nIt was at that point that I turned onto our street and saw all of the vehicles parked out front with their red and blue lights flashing. \nOh yes, I thought to myself. It's Tuesday. Mexican food night at the Johnson residence. \nI made a U-turn and went back to work.", "Gather round, children. The stars are shining in the sky and the fire is burning low. You are entering your twelfth winter and it is time to tell you the tale of the only man who could truly master the metal beasts that once roamed the Earth. Once tamed, the metal beasts would carry us from one place to another. They were ferocious, though. Cold and mean. They could crush a man under their great rubber feet. They could steal everything from a man with their terrifying Interest Rates. Once you had fed a beast, it would forever seem hungry again. Only Woldorf, the Master of Traffic could tame the beasts. With a simple flick of his wrist, his White Gloves of Command would make them turn left or right. With a simple blow of his Whistle of Order, they would stop dead in their tracks. Woldorf would stand, without armour or sword, surrounded on all sides by the beasts and simply signal to them his commands. And they would Obey. All was well in the kingdom until-\n\n-Eddie? Eddie?

I'm not going to tell you again. My God, Eddie. You bleed out round here the goddamn wolves will be eating your goddamn face before you can say 'natural selection in action'.\n\nAll was well in the kingdom until the Day of the Subaru. 'T was a dark day in the kingdom. Rain lashed the hard, paved ground like the Inquisitor lashes unbelievers. Lightning cracked the sky like the Executioner cracks the skulls of the criminals we convict. The metal beasts pounded the ground like we have all, at one time or another, pounded Eddie's mother. But unlike Eddie's parentage, nothing was uncertain on this day. Terror was in the air.\n\nThe Subaru, a wild, untameable creature, had refused to stop at the Signalling Lights. It had not slowed down by the Command of the Roadsigns. It had Overtaken on the Right as was forbidden by Law. It was an ugly, oversized, unruly animal. Woldorf raised his gloves to halt the beast. And the beast could do nothing but obey.\n\nThe rainslicked ground was slippery and the great rubber feet - despite the authority of Woldorf's command, could do nothing to halt its progress. It spun, throwing rain and rock in the air, getting closer and closer to the moment when-\n\n-Well who fucking told you that was going to happen, Eddie? Who *warned* you? Any number of goddamn times, that putting a sharpened stick up your nose was going to end up with your face covered in blood. Go stand downwind of me, you little sonofawhore. I'm not getting eaten by jackals because your mother got knocked up by misshapen sperm. My God, kid. You're like The Kevin Of Old.\n\nThe Subaru spun towards him and rolled. Metal and glass exploded out and in. Screeching and howling splintered the very air as the Subaru rolled, out of control, unstoppable towards the White Gloved Hero of the Streets. Woldorf stood tall as the beast was nearly upon him when he saw The Child. Crossing the road to get a ball. In the path of the beast. Woldorf reached out, the tips of his fingers nearing the cloth of the child's shirt, wanting nothing but his safety. He threw himself forward to push and-\n\n-Right. Fuck this. No, Eddie.

As a leading expert in demonic psychology, she had spent years studying the phenomena. When demons were first proven to exist, the world went into chaos. Riots broke out in cities, and governments scrambled to establish protocols for dealing with possessions.\nBut then, something unexpected happened. Scientists discovered that the symptoms of possession were not signs of demonic malevolence, but rather a diagnosable medical condition. The relentless itrades, the convulsions, the eerie whispers in dead languages \u2013 it was all just a manifestation of a malfunctioning brain chemistry.\nWith the help of modern medicine, possessions became treatable. Antipsychotics, beta blockers, and cognitive therapy became the standard treatment for demonic infestations. People began to see possessions not as a supernatural curse, but as a manageable condition.\nRachel's clinic, \"Soulhaven\", was one of the first to specialize in treatment and research. She had seen it all \u2013 from garden-variety demonic possessions to more exotic cases like demonic-induced psychosis. But nothing could have prepared her for the case that would change everything.\nThat case was Emilia.\nEmilia, a 25-year-old art student, arrived at Soulhaven in a straitjacket. Her parents had reported bizarre behavior \u2013 Emilia would draw strange symbols on the walls, recite Shakespearean sonnets in her sleep, and was convinced that the devil himself was whispering in her ear. Rachel's team quickly diagnosed Emilia with a severe case of demonic-induced dissociative disorder.\nAs treatment began, Rachel noticed something peculiar. Emilia's demon, which she had named \"Malakai\", seemed to be adapting to the medication. At first, Malakai raged against the treatment, making Emilia lash out in violent fits. But as the days passed, Malakai grew quieter, retreating into the shadows of Emilia's mind.\nRachel was intrigued. This wasn't typical behavior for a demon. Most possessed individuals would resist treatment, their demons refusing to let go. But Malakai seemed... interested.\nOne evening, as Rachel reviewed Emilia's progress, she received an unexpected visit from Malakai himself. Emilia's eyes rolled back, and a low, raspy voice spoke from her lips.\n\"Rachel, we need to talk.\"\nRachel was taken aback, but she leaned forward, eager to listen.\n\"What do you want, Malakai?\" she asked.\nMalakai chuckled, his voice dripping with sarcasm. \"Oh, please. You think I'm just a mindless beast, don't you? But I assure you, Rachel, I have... plans. And Emilia here is key.\"\nRachel's eyes widened as Malakai began to reveal a sinister plot, one that threatened the very fabric of modern society. Possessions were not just random events, but coordinated attacks on humanity. Demons like Malakai were manipulating the minds of world leaders, sowing discord and chaos.\nRachel knew she had to act fast. She assembled a team of experts and worked tirelessly to uncover the truth behind the demonic conspiracy. Together, they stumbled upon a shocking revelation \u2013 the demons were not the problem; they were the symptom.\nA rogue organization, hiding in plain sight, was using advanced mind control techniques to trigger possessions, creating a global network of unwitting puppets. The demons, simply opportunistic, took advantage of the openings.\nWith this knowledge, Rachel and her team set out to expose the truth and dismantle the organization. In the end, it was Emilia, with Malakai's reluctant help, who delivered the final blow.\nAs the dust settled, Rachel realized that possessions were no longer just a manageable medical condition, but a doorway to a hidden war. One that humanity had been fighting, unwittingly, for centuries.\nSoulhaven became the epicenter of a new era \u2013 one of demontology, where researchers, psychologists, and psychologists worked together to understand and counter the forces of demonic manipulation. Rachel's clinic became a place not just for treating possessions, but for studying the strategies of the enemy.\nAnd Emilia? She continued to create art, her voice whispers with the secrets of the possessed. Her paintings, once chaotic and disturbing, now revealed a hidden truth \u2013 that even in the darkest corners of the human mind, there was always a glimmer of hope.", "The Gray Scientist smirked as he poured himself another glass of wine. Decades of research had finally paid off. The children were already spread across the city. Each of them was genetically pure, and in a few more years they would release a toxin, rendering the impure races sterile.\n\nIt had been a hard battle. That Detective girl found him out and had nearly ruined the whole thing. However, she didn't know about the Minister. While she was busy looking through laboratories and state buildings and hospitals, the Minister was quietly handing out children through the church.\n\nEven if she knew, by this point it would be too late. The children were designed, by necessity, to camouflage their existence. They would look like any other child until their fifth birthday, after which they would replace humanity. It was almost beautiful how it worked - it was genetic engineering turned into an art form.\n\nThe Gray Scientist knew he was going to die when he entered his mansion. The Detective was relentless and brilliant. She probably thought she could save some small fragment of society as long as he did not live to create more perfect children. She might even be right. It didn't matter though - he had already won. He confidently entered the mansion with a self-righteous grin on his face. *Victory is mine*\n\nIn an instant his heart sunk. He thought he had been prepared for anything. No matter what form of death the Detective chose to give him, he had resolved to take it pridefully. But now he could not even stand. His entire consciousness broke - he fell to the floor, he wept, he retched. His body, mind, and soul all screamed out in pain.\n\nThe Detective had been waiting for him. She stood in the center of the main hall, smiling victoriously. To the Scientist she looked like a demon who had just stolen some poor man's soul. There had been twenty-five children created through his work. They looked the same as any other child. He had thought it impossible to distinguish between his children and a normal child.\n\nThe scene in front of him revealed the Detective's solution. His twenty-five perfect children were in the room, mutilated and torn apart. She had collected each and every one of them and ended their life. How had she identified his children?\n\nThe Scientist cursed himself. It was impossible to tell them apart. The Detective knew this as well as he did. While he believed this made his plan invincible, she simply reached the obvious solution.\n\nShe didn't need to know which children were his. As long as she killed every child in the city she would be certain that his twenty-five were among them. His twenty-five children were in this room, murdered, along with over a hundred others.\n\nHe could also tell that this wasn't a move of desperation either. Each of the corpses had the same intricate set of wounds, designed to ensure death without triggering any toxins. He thought she had been searching the city on a wild goose chase, but he could see now that was a deception. She knew from the start that the Scientist wasn't the one distributing the children. She already knew what she would have to do. She visited his labs to understand how the toxin would be released. She visited statehouses and hospitals to learn which households had young children.\n\nWith full knowledge of his defeat, the Scientist could only weep as the Detective calmly walked up to him. She leaned down, whispered \"I win,\" and carefully plunged the knife into his chest. Slowly and methodically, his corpse was added to the pile.", "It was a typical Tuesday evening for Dave, huddled in his small garage workshop, tinkering with his latest toy: a 1960s-era Citizens' Band (CB) Radio. He had spent hours scouring local flea markets and thrift stores to find the perfect model, and now he was determined to get it working. As he fiddled with the dials and wires, he suddenly heard a strange, warbled voice crackling through the speakers.\n\n\"...Galactic Coordinates 78492-Delta-5...receiving cargo shipment...over.\"\n\nDave's eyes widened in confusion. What was going on? He hadn't even set the frequency to anything except the standard 27 MHz band. He hesitated for a moment, wondering if it was some kind of prank or interference, but the voice continued, this time with a hint of urgency.\n\n\"...repeat, we are experiencing gravitational wave fluctuations...requesting confirmation of cargo manifest...any station, respond...\"\n\nDave's curiosity got the better of him, and he tentatively picked up the microphone. \"Uh, hello? Is...is this some kind of joke?\"\n\nThe response was immediate, and this time the voice was laced with a mix of surprise and annoyance. \"Who...what station is this? You are not listed in the Galactic Registry. Identify yourself!\"\n\nDave, still trying to wrap his head around the situation, stumbled over his words. \"I...I'm just a guy with a CB Radio...from Earth...I think I must have...accidentally tuned into...whatever this is?\"\n\nA pause ensued, followed by a strange, almost-perplexed tone from the alien voice. \"Earth? That is a...third-tier colony planet, is it not? I have never heard of a CB Radio being used for intergalactic communication. How...quaint.\"\n\nDave, starting to feel like he was trapped in a science fiction movie, tentatively asked, \"Uh, who are you? And what's going on?\"\n\nThe alien identified himself as Zrhk'tk, the cargo freighter's chief navigator, and explained that they were transporting a shipment of rare space minerals across the galaxy. \"We do not typically communicate with...amateur operators,\" Zrhk'tk said with a hint of disdain, \"but I suppose this is a historic occasion. The first contact between our species, facilitated by a...CB Radio?\"\n\nAs the conversation continued, Dave and Zrhk'tk struggled to understand each other's cultures and technologies. Dave, amazed by the possibility of extraterrestrial life, asked Zrhk'tk about his planet, his people, and their way of life. Zrhk'tk, equally fascinated by the human's naivety, explained the basics of intergalactic politics and commerce.\n\nTheir impromptu conversation was cut short when Zrhk'tk's superiors warned him about the potential risks of communicating with an unregistered planet. \"We cannot risk revealing our presence to an unprepared species,\" they warned. Zrhk'tk apologized and hastily terminated the transmission.\n\nAs the static faded, Dave sat in stunned silence, trying to process what had just happened. He had, quite literally, stumbled into something much bigger than himself. The CB Radio, once a mere relic of the past, had become a gateway to the unknown.\n\nDave's encounter with Zrhk'tk sent shockwaves through the scientific community, and soon, the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs, governments, and various space agencies clamored to learn more about the incident. Dave, once a reclusive electronics enthusiast, found himself thrust into the spotlight, hailed as the accidental ambassador to the stars.", "In the realm of Azura, where the sun dipped into the horizon and painted the sky with hues of crimson and gold, the city of Eldrid thrived. It was a metropolis of marvels, where ancient spires and grand architecture stood as testaments to the ingenuity and prosperity of its people. However, amidst the grandeur and beauty of Eldrid, a somber truth lurked. For centuries, a subjugated race known as the Korvath had toiled as slaves, their destinies bound to the will of their human masters.\n\nThe Korvath were a humanoid species, with striking features and physiques that diverged from those of their human counterparts. They stood shorter, with more muscular builds and skin that seemed to absorb the surrounding light, rendering them nearly invisible in the shadows. Their eyes, an unsettling shade of pale blue, appeared almost...empty. As if the very essence of their being had been extinguished.\n\nAccording to the revered scriptures of Eldrid, the Korvath were born from the primordial chaos, their genetic makeup flawed from the outset. It was said that the Great Architect, the deity responsible for creating the world, had intentionally designed the Korvath to be weak and subservient, their inferior biology making them ideal for servitude.\n\nAs a result, the Korvath were relegated to menial tasks, their days spent toiling in the depths of Eldrid's mines, farms, and factories. Their existence was one of drudgery, with little room for hope or ambition. Very few humans dared challenge this norm, for it was deeply ingrained in the cultural fabric of Eldrid that the Korvath were inherently inferior.\n\nKael, a young and daring Korvath, dared to defy this notion. Born with an insatiable curiosity and an innate desire for learning, Kael had always questioned the status quo. He would often sneak away from his duties to listen in on human scholars, absorbing knowledge like a sponge. His intellect and wit went unnoticed by his human overlords, who saw him as just another compliant slave.\n\nOne fateful day, a delegation of esteemed scholars from the esteemed Academy of Azura arrived in Eldrid. Among them was the renowned geneticist, Elara Vex. Intrigued by the Korvath's supposed inferiority, Elara began to study their genetic code. She soon discovered an unsettling truth: the Korvath were not inherently flawed, as the scriptures claimed. Instead, their DNA revealed a deliberate attempt to suppress their cognitive abilities, imbuing them with a docility that made them more pliable slaves.\n\nArmed with this knowledge, Elara decided to take a bold stance against the established order. She presented her findings to the governing council of Eldrid, pleading for the Korvath's emancipation. Kael, who had been observing from the shadows, saw an opportunity to join the fight for his people's freedom.\n\nTogether, Elara and Kael formed an unlikely alliance, using the geneticist's findings to challenge the long-held assumptions about the Korvath. As they spread their message, whispers of dissent began to echo throughout Eldrid. More and more humans began to question the morality of enslaving an entire species, sparking a contentious debate that would change the course of history.\n\nWith each passing day, the call for the Korvath's freedom grew louder. Elara's research had ignited a beacon of hope, casting light upon the shadows that had shrouded the subjugated species for so long. As Kael stood alongside his new ally, he felt the weight of his heritage begin to lift. For the first time, he could envision a future where he and his kin were not bound by the chains of oppression, but free to forge their own paths.\n\nThe fate of the Korvath hung precariously in the balance. Would they finally be granted the freedom and recognition they deserved, or would the entrenched institutions of Eldrid silence the nascent movement? The battle for the future had begun, and the outcome would forever reshape the destiny of Azura.", "Phantom Hunter\n\nI've never been caught, never been seen. My reputation precedes me: \"The Phantom Hunter,\" the world's most feared Pok\u00e9mon assassin. My services are in high demand, and my fees are astronomical. But I don't kill for sport, nor for cruelty. I'm a precision instrument, a scalpel in a world of brutal force.\n\nMy first briefing came from a well-heeled client in a luxurious Tokyo high-rise. A sleek, silver-haired woman with piercing green eyes handed me a folder containing a photograph of my mark: a level 50 Giratina.\n\n\"It's haunting our operations,\" she said, her voice devoid of emotion. \"Drone attacks on our facilities, employees spooked by its shadowy appearances. We need it gone.\"\n\nMy research took me to the darkest corners of the Pok\u00e9mon world. I stalked my prey, analyzed its movements, identified its patterns. Giratina was a formidable foe, with the power to warp space-time itself. But I wasn't here to praise its strengths. I was here to exploit its weaknesses.\n\nMy arsenal consisted of stealth technology and an arsenal of custom-made Pok\u00e9 Balls, designed to neutralize rather than harm. These weren't ordinary Balls \u2013 they contained miniature energy fields that could mimic the Arceus-like aura of a 'Me Project's seed Pok\u00e9mon. Legend had it that when a Pok\u00e9mon outfitted with this '", "I looked at the nearly identical houses lined up to either side of me. I was in a suburban garage sale and about to buy a typewriter. I hesitated for a bit, thinking my friends would continue to call me a hipster, but I had to have it. I paid the suburbanite $245 and loaded the Olympia SM9 in the passenger seat of my Volkswagen Golf. I may have patted the top of the typewriter a few times as we drove back into the city where we belong. Finally I could become a writer.\n\nI carefully place the typewriter on top of my levelled desk and load a piece of paper. I press the carriage return button and watch with joy as the carriage zooms left. Then there's the satisfying ring at the end. Wonderful! Time to take this thing for a test drive. I think it would be nice to have a hardboiled crime book under my belt.\n\n--- The killer stepped out onto the street and grabbed the first woman he saw. He pulled the handgun up to her head. ---\n\nWait, maybe I should change that to a specific handgun from the 1930s. Google says a Colt 1903 would work. Okay, let's just change that. Oh. That's right, this is a typewriter. We'll get to that in the second draft. Stephen King says to just keep writing. I'll do that.\n\nSuddenly, I hear a scream outside. I pull open the mini-blinds and see a man in a trench coat grabbing onto the screaming woman. He's got a gun to her head but is just standing there. I get 9-1 dialed just as a police car pull up. Over the next minute, the police manage to get the woman freed and handcuff the man. I sit and absorb the scene thinking about how great my environment is for writing.\n\nI pull the paper out of the typewriter. I need to write something happier, a comic relief, after all of that. Anyway, I've heard it's good to have two stories going at once. So you can get your head out of one while working on the other. My second book should be like a children's book, but have concepts that only adults would get too. Those are super popular now. Oh, I can make some pages that you can color in. People love coloring books now too.\n\n--- The young elephant looks at his mom and dad, \"Will I be a big brother one day?\" The daddy elephant looked suggestively at the mommy elephant and said, \"Oh, I'm sure we can make you a baby brother or sister.\" ---\n\nPerfect! I'm on a roll today!\n\nAnother scream outside. I run to the window and almost can't believe what I'm seeing. Three elephants just walking down the street: two big ones and one youngster. They don't look upset at all with the cars honking at them. Now, I don't want to make any assumptions about their sexes. But one of the elephants starts mounting another one.\n\nThis is all just too weird. First I wrote about a man grabbing a woman with a gun, then it happened outside. Next I wrote about three elephants and they appear right out my window. I think an experiment is in order. I sit down at my typewriter and put a new sheet of paper in. Hmm, I'm going to have to look into paying for carbon credits from all this paper when I get more established.\n\n--- The world-class author was surprised to find a steaming cup of Little Skip's coffee waiting for him. But then he remembered he lives alone and started worrying about who put it there. ---\n\nOkay, let's see what happens. I walk into the kitchen and see a steaming cup of coffee on my counter. Oh my! I go to take a sip. Even though I saw the label on the cup, I can tell the \"vintage\" of this brew. Wait, that's right. I do live alone. That means somebody else is in here? I go through my bedroom and bathroom but don't see anybody. Phew.\n\nI come back and take a seat on the pew that I've repurposed into general seating. I can literally feel the responsibility of my typewriter grow. I think of writing about how my entire building decided to start complying with recycling laws today. But if I can do that, I can get the whole city to do it. Or even the whole world.\n\nOkay, let me think big here. World peace? That's not bad... Pollution? I could get rid of it all... Oh, I know! Global warming.\n\nI run to the typewriter. I have my fingers poised above the keys while I think of the perfect sentence to write.\n\n--- Temperatures on Earth would continuously drop...............\n\nHmm, the ribbon is out of ink. I should have another one in the next couple days. It's a good thing I have Amazon Prime.\n\nI look outside and see snowflakes. That's weird. It's still summer.\n\n***\n\nIf you liked this, check out other stories I've written at https://www.reddit.com/r/neromike/", "I am an Edger. \nTo understand what that means, you have to have been raised on the Edge, that razor-sharp line demarcating the border of the Diurnals and the Nocturnals. During times of peace, the most prosperous region to be in, the center of all trade...during times of war, the most dangerous, the launching point of every preemptive strike. \nBeing an Edger meant not getting involved in politics, but it also meant having a hand in every action. You couldn't ignore the two most powerful groups that surrounded you, but neither could you interfere with their affairs. Neutrality was the word every Edge citizen took to heart even before they took to walking. Neutrality, and of course, opportunity. \nI suppose to truly know Edge, you have to know the two other main players. Nocturna, with its cold mysteries and even temperament; Diurna, with its blazing glamour and mercurial lifestyle. Dealing with those of the East required calmness, simplicity, aloofness...dealing with those from the West required stubbornness, complications, pride...the measure of a true Edger was his ability to flip between the two requisite states without hesitation. \nWhen someone with that sunlit glow entered your shop, you haggled for every possible coin regardless of the item's worth, when someone with the pale of moon about them entered, you firmly decided on a price and only wavered if a valid reason was offered...if both entered your shop, interested in the same item, you would scream and threaten the first while calculatingly discussing the merits of paying more for the item with the second, back and forth, without ever breaking stride or even giving the slightest hint that you preferred one method over the other. A slip up earned the Edge merchant disgrace, lost him patronage from both sides, for who can trust a non-neutral outsider Edger? \nDuring times of war, oh, those merchants of such gildsilvered tongues had even more at risk. If a Diurnal blew up your house in a moment of battlelust, or a Nocturnal strategically targeted the same house for gassing, you were required to take up arms, to mete out both justice and revenge equally and without hesitation, but to never cross the line into taking a side. \nLikewise, if it appeared one side was winning, it was up to the Edgers to make sure to provide just enough resistance to prevent a victory. The Nocturnals saw it as Edge high-strategy and approved, whereas the Diurnals saw it as Edge nobility and commitment to a cause and also approved. \nNeither side, nor most Edgers to be fair, saw it for what it really was - a careful, desperate balancing act. After all, both sides saw Edge as foreign, as people not truly compatible with them...however, we were just slightly more compatible, more trustworthy, than those filthy Dis/Nocts. \nI said before that I was an Edger. I truly still believe that, that I am acting according to the dictates and rules of my society. However, at the same time, I am no longer welcome in Edge, nor Nocturna, nor Diurna. \nI made the damn fool mistake of getting married. \nExiled to my airborne steamship, stolen from the Diurnals yet powered by Nocturnal technology, I find myself in the most peculiar position an Edger could ever be. \nNobody knows where I am - to be frank, nobody cares. Not even the now exwife, who couldn't bear to join my shame and renounced me, choosing instead to become an Edge citizen to balance out the scales tipped by my exile. \nAnd I can win this. \nToo long have the people of Edge been walking a thin line of their own making, too afraid to commit to a side, yet too brave to stand by while things resolve themselves. It was obvious that nowhere in the equation was an outcome where Edge could come out on top, so a victory surely meant a defeat. \nBut I've got an unregistered flying vessel, equipped with the latest in military grade Diurnal technology, outfitted with the most illegal of Nocturnal weaponry, with a few clever Edge modifications...and my crew of fellow Exiles. \nFunny how nobody ever wondered where exiles went to. Myself, I always assumed that they died immediately after, for who could live in a world where no power accepted them? But after my own exile, the answer became obvious, so obvious that in retrospect I feared to follow through, expecting that other people smarter than I had also concluded earlier than me what I had just concluded, and taken action. \nYet the North Pole was thriving. Technically part of Edge, half in the light and half in the dark...but too cold and forbidding for Diurnals, too far away and tactically worthless for Nocturnals, and as a result, too unimportant for Edgers to invest in. The only place where Exiles could congregate, regardless of their prior affiliations, and survive. \nWe've all decided, after putting it to a vote (one system that all three nations - four, if you count the Exiles of the Poles - agreed upon's validity) that Edge should come out on top. In fact, Edge shall expand, shall dominate the world, the only way to permanently end the war that has plagued this planet since we humans first began to walk upon it. Funnily enough, to win this fight for Edge, we must declare war on Edge. One last act of balancing, as we cut a straight line to the South Pole, where preparations are nearing completion. \nI neglected to mention in my description of the airworthy vessel I pilot the most important upgrade upon it. Exile technology. I myself am unaware of how it works, something to do with magnetic waves saturating the entire planet, but according to their best and brightest, once I make this delivery, the device left behind in the North will resonate with the device delivered to the South, and Diurna, Nocturna, and Edge will be no more. All they had waited for, for decades, was a vessel that could survive the trip, even when all sides saw it as a threat to be eliminated. \nTheir fear is greatly justified. This device, they tell me, is powerful enough to start the planet revolving, spinning like a children's toy in the vastness of space, and the blessing of the sun and promise of the moon will both splash upon its surface equally as it rotates. \nI am an Edger. But not for much longer. Soon, Edge will be no more, yet Edge will be the entire world. Soon, everyone will be an Edger, hundreds of times each year, but never for more than a moment. \nLet the revolutions begin.", "Try to listen to me, Altoid.\n\nThe robots beeps happily. \"I always listen to you, master. I do whatever master says.\"\n\n\"God damn it, when did I upload Gollum's personality into you?\"\n\nAltoid beeps softly again. \"Gollum is a character created by British author J. R. R. Tolkien.

The dramatic pose was a familiar one, a symbol of freedom and adventure, but for Jack, it was more than just a gesture \u2013 it was an escape.\n\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm orange glow over the rolling hills, Jack felt a weight lift off his shoulders. He left behind the troubles of the small town of Red Rock, where a bitter land dispute had pitted the townsfolk against each other. Jack, a loner with a sharp mind and quick draw, had stood up to the ruthless landowner, McKinley, and paid the price \u2013 a price that almost cost him his life.\n\nNow, with the open range stretching out before him like an endless sea, Jack felt alive. The rhythmic thud of Pecos's hooves, the creaking of the saddle, and the whispering wind all combined to ease his troubled mind. For the first time in weeks, he felt a glimmer of hope.\n\nDays passed, and Jack rode north, following the setting sun as it led him deeper into the unknown. He encountered a group of friendly outlaws, who shared their campfire and stories of the lawless west. They warned him of hardscrabble towns and merciless bounty hunters, but Jack knew the risks. He'd faced down danger before, and a hidden talent for music and poetry had always been his solace.\n\nAs the weeks turned into months, Jack's reputation as a wandering minstrel grew. Folks in dusty towns and rural ranches would gather 'round as he strummed his battered guitar and spun tales of adventure and loss. His voice, rich and smooth as whiskey, would melt the hard edges of even the grumpiest of ranch hands. They called him \"Sunset Jack,\" a name that preceded him from town to town, and whispers of his exploits filtered back to Red Rock.\n\nBut Jack's fame also brought unwanted attention. McKinley, still seething from their last confrontation, dispatched a pair of deadly trackers to hunt down the cowboy. Jack, ever vigilant, detected their presence before they could close in. He outwitted and outran them, leading the pair on a wild goose chase through the Arizona badlands.\n\nOne fateful evening, as a crimson moon rose over the desert, Jack rode into the small town of Willow Creek. Pecos, now 20, was showing his age, and Jack decided it was time to settle down, if only for a little while. He dismounted at the local saloon, where a tall, raven-haired woman with piercing green eyes tended bar.\n\nJack ordered a whiskey, and as they talked, the woman, Carolina, absorbed the rough edges of his story. For the first time since leaving Red Rock, Jack felt the weight of his wanderings ease. Over dinner and under starry skies, he revealed his passion for poetry and music, and Carolina, charmed by his rough-around-the-edges vulnerability, revealed her own dreams of becoming a writer.\n\nAs the night drew to a close, Jack leaned in, his lips brushing against Carolina's, igniting a fire that would last a lifetime. In Willow Creek, Jack laid down his guns, shed his nomadic ways, and took up the pen, chronicling the adventures of Sunset Jack, the cowboy who rode off into the sunset and discovered a new home.\n\nAnd when folks asked about the sunset he'd chased for so long, Jack would smile, his eyes twinkling like the embers of a dying campfire. \"The sunset?\" he'd say, \"That's where I left my worries behind and found a new beginning \u2013 in the light of a brand new dawn.\"", "Immortals. They...we were called immortals. After the last life threatening disease ever to exist on this sphere was eradicated in 5645 AD, perfection as a race was not very far away. No more hunger, no more poverty, no sickness, and most importantly, no more death. This held up for almost 6 decades and we couldn't be more proud of ourselves. Our leading scientists devised a formula that recoded our DNA to regenerate indefinitely and interminably. This made us immortal. You know how they say that you acquire a new body every 10 years? Well imagine acquiring one every 10 months. The formula was designed to also stop aging at 25 years of age, which meant you could be 100 years old and maintain the body of a 30 year old. We had made ourselves immortal. We became gods, and not gods like those of Egyptian folklore, or those found in Rome or Greece, no! We were real gods. After almost 60 years of no deaths in the world, things were beginning to get tight. We couldn't build any higher to fit all of the population and we were running out of food. Only one solution was created, an anti-formula that took our immortality, and reduced it to a mere 100 years to fulfill our dreams and desires. What were we thinking playing God. Everyone was given this \"vaccine\" and within months, those that were approaching 100 years old, those who had received the immortal vaccine back in 5645 in their mid 40's, slowly began to die off. It was the turn of the millennium we were returning to a manageable population. Of course not everyone was ok with this. There was a small group, a small sect if you will that defied this order and never got the immortality ending formula. The formula was never made again to teach those that didn't get it a lesson that immortality isn't all that it seems to be. Of course there were public records that showed everyone's age and their exact 100th birthday, and everyday the Remain Extracting and People Eradication Responders (R.E.A.P.E.R) would go out in search for those correspondents whose day it was to be, well, eliminated or extracted. So we come to me. Why am I so special? Truth be told I'm not, but it just happens that yesterday was my turn to be extracted. I'm still alive, I'm not dead. I'm terrified, have I done something wrong? Last night I had a dream of a man with a long gray beard. I remember lots of running and hiding. But most of all, I remember crying and bullets and blood. Why am I not dead. My time is up. I'm 100 years and 1 day old. The REAPER hasn't come for me yet and I'm starting to get worried. Am I really complaining that I'm not dead? This morning I found a diary. Mostly old pictures and a letter. In those pictures are two men and a child. It's the man with the long gray beard from my dreams! I read the letter. My grandfather and father. The leader of the sect that didn't get vaccinated. No records of me ever existing. Bullets won't do good since my flesh will regenerate in a month's time. I'm stuck here forever. I have to find them!!", "I have never been this nervous in my entire life. I could feel the sweat slowly dripping down my face. It was all or nothing, my entire career had led up to this moment. I never thought the day would come where I would have to say this. But I've been backed into a corner and I have no choice.\n\n\"My confession is that I'm guilty of the worst crime imaginable, guilty of caring too much for my city. Guilty of caring for all the people that live within it. Guilty of being tired of letting our people live in fear. I'm not the person this city deserves but I'm the one it needs. My confession ladies and gentlemen is that I, Bruce Wayne, am the Batman", "I tried the door handle for what felt like the hundredth time, but it wouldn't budge. I tugged, pulled, and even attempted to yank it open, but it was as if it had been welded shut. The same went for the windows \u2013 they refused to slide or swing open. Panic started to set in. I needed to get some fresh air, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was trapped in my own home.\n\nIn desperation, I turned to my computer and logged into Reddit, hoping to find some sort of solution or, at the very least, someone who could offer some reassurance. I navigated to the front page and scanned the posts, my eyes widening as I saw the most upvoted thread: \"Help, my door is stuck, any tips to get it open?\" \u2013 over a million comments and just two hours old.\n\nI clicked on the post and began reading the comments. The original poster, u/stuckIndoor, described a situation eerily similar to mine. Their door had simply stopped working, and they were starting to get worried. As I scrolled through the comments, I saw a slew of suggestions: try lubricating the hinges, use a hair dryer to heat the lock, and even break the door down (which, understandably, was met with warnings of caution).\n\nBut as the comments went on, something strange began to emerge. More and more people were chiming in, saying that their doors and windows were stuck too. At first, I thought it was just the usual internet echo chamber, but as the accounts piled up, I realized that something more was going on.\n\nA user named u/EngineeringDropout proposed an interesting theory: \"What if it's not just a coincidence? What if there's some sort of global event or phenomenon causing this? Has anyone checked for seismic activity or unusual atmospheric pressure?\"\n\nAs I continued to read, I noticed that more and more people were coming to the same conclusion. It wasn't just a localized issue; it seemed to be happening everywhere.\n\nI decided to contribute to the thread, sharing my own experience. \"I'm stuck in my home, just like OP,\" I typed. \"I've tried everything, but nothing's working. Is it possible that there's something bigger going on here?\"\n\nAs I hit submit, I saw my post get immediately upvoted. Suddenly, I was part of a global community, all of us struggling to understand what was happening.\n\nAs the hours passed, the theories poured in: government experiments gone wrong, alien invasions, and even the apocalypse. But amidst all the chaos, something else emerged: a sense of solidarity. Strangers were coming together, sharing their stories and trying to make sense of the situation.\n\nEventually, a Redditor who claimed to be an engineer with knowledge of advanced materials science posted a possible explanation: a freak atmospheric occurrence had caused a worldwide coating of a rare, metal-like substance to form on door and window handles, making them impossible to open.\n\nIt was a wild theory, but it gave us hope. The engineering community on Reddit came together to brainstorm ways to neutralize the substance, and slowly, solutions began to emerge. Eventually, a user named u/DIY_Superstar shared a method involving baking soda and vinegar that managed to dislodge the coating.\n\nI decided to give it a try. With some shaking and sweating, I managed to finally open my door. The feeling of freedom was exhilarating. I took a deep breath of fresh air, feeling a sense of community and solidarity that stayed with me long after the world returned to normal.\n\nAs I closed my laptop, I couldn't help but think that Reddit, with its sprawling networks of strangers, had managed to do what no other system could: bring together a global community of problem-solvers in a moment of crisis. And when it mattered most, it was the collective voice of the internet that finally set us free.", "Detective Jameson sat across from the man, his eyes locked on the cold, calculating gaze of his captor. He had been tracking this serial killer for months, and finally, he had been led to this abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. The air was thick with the smell of decay and rot, a fitting backdrop for the conversation that was about to unfold.\n\nThe killer, known only as \"The Architect\" to the media, leaned back in his chair, steepling his fingers together as he began to speak. \"I need you to understand something before I kill you, Detective,\" he said, his voice low and measured.\n\nJameson raised an eyebrow. \"And what's that?\"\n\nThe Architect smiled, a cold, mirthless smile. \"You see, I'm not a monster. At least, not in the way you think I am. I'm a artist, a visionary. I see the world in a different way, a way that few others can comprehend.\"\n\nJameson snorted. \"You call killing innocent people art?\"\n\nThe Architect shook his head. \"Ah, but that's where you're wrong, Detective. The people I kill are not innocent. They're all part of a larger tapestry, a web of deceit and corruption that you're too blind to see.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" Jameson spat.\n\nThe Architect leaned forward, his eyes gleaming with intensity. \"I'm talking about the way society is structured. The way we're all conditioned to follow the norms, to conform to the expectations of others. The way we're all trapped in this prison of monotony and routine.\"\n\n\"And you think killing people will change that?\"\n\nThe Architect shook his head. \"No, Detective. I think killing people will highlight it. Will bring attention to it. Make people see the world for what it truly is.\"\n\nJameson laughed, a harsh, mocking sound. \"You think you're some kind of social commentator? Some kind of revolutionary?\"\n\nThe Architect's smile grew wider. \"I'm just a reflection of the world around me, Detective. A mirror held up to the darkness that lurks within every human heart. And I'm not just talking about the people I kill. I'm talking about you, too.\"\n\nJameson's eyes narrowed. \"What do you mean?\"\n\nThe Architect leaned forward, his voice dropping to a whisper. \"I mean that you're just as trapped as everyone else, Detective. You're bound by your own rules, your own expectations. You're a prisoner of your own morality.\"\n\nJameson felt a shiver run down his spine as The Architect's words struck home. He knew that the killer was trying to get inside his head, to plant some kind of seed of doubt. But he also knew that he couldn't let it work. He had to stay focused, had to keep his wits about him if he was going to survive this.\n\nHe leaned forward, his eyes locked on The Architect's. \"You know, I think you're just trying to justify what you've done. To make yourself feel better about the lives you've taken.\"\n\nThe Architect chuckled, a low, menacing sound. \"Perhaps, Detective. But that doesn't change the fact that soon, you'll be just another part of my tapestry. Another piece of the puzzle.\"\n\nJameson's eyes flicked around the room, searching for an escape. But there was none. He was trapped, and The Architect knew it.\n\nWith a sudden burst of adrenaline, Jameson launched himself at The Architect, but the killer was too quick. He sidestepped Jameson's attack with ease, his hands moving swiftly to wrap a noose around the detective's neck.\n\nAs the life was slowly squeezed from his body, Jameson caught a glimpse of The Architect's face, a face that was twisted into a snarl of triumph and satisfaction. And in that moment, Jameson realized that the killer had been right. He was a mirror, a reflection of the world's darker impulses.\n\nBut as the darkness closed in around him, Jameson also knew that there was one thing that The Architect would never understand. The true power of humanity lay not in its darkness, but in its capacity for compassion, for love, and for redemption. And it was that spark of hope that would ultimately be The Architect's downfall.", "I'll never forget the day I discovered I could read minds. I was 7 years old, sitting in my second-grade classroom, staring blankly at the chalkboard as Mrs. Johnson droned on about fractions. Suddenly, I was bombarded by a cacophony of thoughts from my classmates. \"I wish I could go home and play with my new puppy.\" \"I'm so hungry, I hope my mom packed me a sandwich for lunch.\" \"I hate fractions, they're so boring.\" The thoughts swirled around me like a tornado, overwhelming and disorienting.\n\nAs I grew older, I learned to control my ability, filtering out the constant chatter in my mind to focus on the thoughts that were relevant or interesting. I became a silent observer, watching as people's innermost thoughts and feelings played out like a private movie in my mind.\n\nMost people didn't even realize I was listening. They'd think their darkest secrets were safe, locked away in their own minds, but I knew the truth. I knew who was hiding an affair, who was struggling with addiction, and who was secretly in love with their best friend.\n\nBut one day, everything changed.\n\nI was walking through the park on my lunch break when I stumbled upon a peculiar old man. He was sitting on a bench, surrounded by a haze of pipeweed and philosophical texts. His thoughts were unlike anyone else's \u2013 a jumble of poetry and Eastern philosophy, with a hint of mischief.\n\nAs I tuned in to his mind, I expected the usual monologue. But instead, I was taken aback by a single, piercing thought: \"Ah, you're the one who's been listening all these years.\"\n\nI felt a jolt of surprise, and my eyes snapped towards the old man. He looked up, catching my gaze, and smiled knowingly.\n\n\"Who are you?\" I asked, unsure of how to process this unexpected development.\n\nThe old man chuckled, his eyes twinkling with amusement. \"Just a fellow traveler, my young friend. And I've been waiting for you.\"\n\nHe told me his name was Eli, and that he had been watching me from afar \u2013 not just with his eyes, but with his mind. He claimed that I wasn't just a passive observer, but a catalyst for change, capable of influencing the world in ways I never thought possible.\n\nAs we spoke, I realized that Eli's thoughts were different from anyone else's. They were like a dialogue, with multiple threads and intriguing detours. I found myself drawn into his world, where the boundaries between reality and fantasy blurred.\n\nOver the next few weeks, I met with Eli regularly, exploring the depths of his mind and learning about the power of thoughts. He taught me how to shape my own thoughts, to create resonance and harmony in the world around me.\n\nI began to see the world in a new light, as a complex web of thoughts and intentions that could be influenced and guided. And with Eli by my side, I felt a sense of purpose I'd never known before \u2013 a sense of belonging to a world beyond the ordinary.\n\nAs I look back, I realize that my ability to read minds had always been a double-edged sword. On one hand, it allowed me to glimpse the beauty and complexity of the human experience. On the other, it had isolated me, making me a hidden observer in a world that often felt like a crowded, silent room.\n\nBut with Eli, everything changed. For the first time in my life, I felt like I'd found a genuine friend \u2013 someone who saw me, not just my surface-level self, but the depths of my own mind and heart.\n\nAnd as we sat in the park, surrounded by the whispers of the city, I knew that I was no longer alone.", "I sat on my couch, sipping my coffee and half-watching the morning news. It was a typical Wednesday morning, with the usual chatter of the anchors and the scrolling ticker of headlines at the bottom of the screen. That's when I saw her. A young woman with piercing green eyes and long, curly brown hair. She was smiling in the photograph, but there was a sadness in her eyes that caught my attention.\n\nThe anchor was speaking, but I didn't hear a word. Time seemed to slow down, and then...it stopped. The clock on the wall froze at 7:04 AM. The coffee in my cup halted mid-sip, and the news anchors' mouths hung open in mid-sentence.\n\nI felt a jolt, like a shockwave had run through my body. And then, something strange happened. Time began to unwind. The clock on the wall started spinning backwards, the hands whirling counterclockwise. The news anchors' mouths closed, and they rewound to the moment before they'd spoken.\n\nI watched in amazement as the world around me reversed. Cars drove backwards out of driveways, birds flew back into their trees, and people un-walked down the sidewalk. It was as if the very fabric of reality had been turned on its head.\n\nAs I sat there, transfixed, I felt a strange connection to the woman in the photograph. I had no idea who she was or what her story was, but I knew I had to find out.\n\nAs time continued to travel backwards, I saw the woman's life unravel before my eyes. I saw her walking backwards through the city streets, un-meeting friends and un-drinking coffee. I saw her un-working at a small caf\u00e9, wiping down tables and restocking dishes.\n\nEventually, I saw her un-returning to her apartment, a cozy little place above a bookstore. I saw her un-entering the door, and as she did, I saw a glimpse of her life. Photos on the walls, books stacked haphazardly on shelves, and a small, fluffy cat un-running across the floor.\n\nAs I continued to watch, I realized that I was witnessing the night before, the night of her murder. I saw a shadowy figure lurking outside her apartment, un-stalking her. My heart ached as I realized that I was watching the last moments of her life.\n\nBut as the clock on the wall continued to spin backwards, I saw something else. I saw the woman, alive and happy, smiling at me from the screen. I saw a glimmer of hope, a chance to change the course of events.\n\nTime finally stopped spinning backwards, and the world around me came to a standstill once more. The clock on the wall read 6:45 AM, 19 minutes before the moment when everything had begun.\n\nI sat there, my mind reeling with the implications. Could I really change the course of events? Could I save the woman in the photograph?\n\nI didn't hesitate. I sprang into action, knowing that every second counted. I grabbed my phone and called the police department, reporting a suspicious person outside the woman's apartment building. I gave them the description of the shadowy figure I had seen, and begged them to send someone over right away.\n\nAs I waited, my heart pounding in my chest, I couldn't help but think about the woman. Who was she? What was her story? And most importantly, would I be able to save her?\n\nThe police sirens sounded outside, and I felt a sense of hope. I had been given a chance to change the course of events, to alter the fate of a stranger. And as I waited for the outcome, I couldn't help but wonder: had I just seen my true love?", "Are you going to buy that or what? The lovely middle-age lady was apparently not favoring my presence.\n\nI slowly turned the watch over in my hands, admiring the craftsmanship and precision parts. It was a truly beautiful Rolex. I'd owned dozens of them in the past, but this watch seemed to speak to me like none before.\n\nI gently laid the watch on the felt lined countertop and fixed the saleswoman in my gaze. \"Yes, I'll take it.\"\n\nLike clockwork, my cellphone rang. I reached into my blazer and extracted not a phone, but a pistol. With practice and speed attained from years of stealing high end timepieces I centered her pretty face in my sights. \"I'll take it alright. Hands up. Good girl. Step back. More. OK, put your back against the wall and your palms against the wall above your head. That's it.\"\n\nShe complied, but the same pinched expression from when I walked into the store remained on her face. She stayed silent, however I heard a faint alarm. I guessed someone in a safe-room was watching us. Without warning steel shutters dropped, covering the windows. Next, I heard a magnetic bolt lock the door. I turned my head to plan my exit strategy. Big mistake.\n\nI began to face the sales lady when I realized she too had drawn a weapon, a hand cannon, and the muzzle of that beast was three inches from my face.\n\n\"Time for you to clock out. Do not be late to Hell.\"\n\nBLAM!\n\nEdit: forgot a word\n\nFeel free to use as you see fit.", "Do you have any last words? asked my executioner. I could n't see his face: the machine was callibrated to transport as little matter as possible, and I was restrained by iron bands to keep me within the boundaries of the time machine.\n\n\"Yeah-do n't I get a say in where you're sending me?\"\n\n\"We do that for lesser offenders, on occasion. But that privilege does not apply to you. Nor will you know where you will be sent,\" he added. \"No fewer than three centuries in the past, that much you no doubt know. But where we will send you is irrelevant. The ghettos of Warsaw, the caldera of Mount St. Helens, the siege of London, the Oubliette of Manhatten...it is of no matter.\"\n\n\"Not particularly fair, trying to get around the moratorium on executions by using time travel.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" said the voice, growing harsh. \"Neither was the murder of Mercedes LaFontaine. She was the greatest\u2014\"\n\n\"Whatever,\" I said over him. \"Just get it over with.\"\n\nThere was a flash of light, and\n\n\u2014\n\nthen I was in a...department store? It had been years since they even existed; the last time I'd been in one was when my mother sent me and my father down to buy a new fridge. I was surrounded by sofas and large red signs with blocky script. Japanese hiragana, maybe.\n\nI went for the door. If I remembered correctly, most governments sent their prisoners on death row back around twenty minutes before their death was assured. No guarantee that the government that had arrested me would do that, or even a guarantee that I'd been arrested by a government at all, but I'd work with the assumption that I had twenty minutes to live.\n\nThere was only one cashiere, an elderly Japanese woman reading a stack of papers printed in black and white. She folded one of the pages over, and I caught a glimpse of the picture on the front: a mushroom cloud.\n\nShit.\n\nI still had my implants from before the assassination: a neural modification allowing hibernation for a set period of time, with no particular requirement for food or oxygen (perfect for masquerading as a mannequin in an antique suit of armour until the date you know that a certain woman will be giving a speech to a large crowd around two feet in front of you, with a positronic disruptor stuffed on one of the gauntlets). That would n't do me much good if my atoms were torn apart by nuclear fury, but it was a start.\n\nI ran back into the store, searching for the right department. Outside, an alarm went off, and the sound of it chilled my bones. I did n't recognize the precise sound, but the meaning of the insistent wail was hard to miss: I was running out of time.\n\nAt last, my whole body shaking from adrealine, I found it: a full-size refrigerator, freezer located on the top. With some effort, I hauled it off the shelf and dropped it to the floor, door facing up. The resonating boom was barely audible over the sound of pandemonium outside.\n\nThere was no time to check if it was lined with lead or another heavy metal, no time to pad myself with styrofoam, no time to prepare at all. But if I was lucky, and survived the blast, then I was safe. I set the time of my hibernation to a week, and shut myself in.\n\nMaybe, with a little luck, I would survive long enough to return to my own time, and finish the job I started.", "It's a struggle, this necromancy business. All I wanted was to bring back the Lord and Master for Earth's Final Reckoning. Not a big ask! And yet it's taken me thirty years to find the necessary books amidst the chaotic dark magic libraries. Those are hard enough to find, hidden beneath the basements of old French hospitals or in the hidden coves of Indian burial grounds. I've traveled the world in search of the answers to Life and Death, but now. Now, I hold the key in my hands, bound in blood and leather.\n\nThe conditions required for the ceremony are as I would expect; a full moon, 5 black candles, a meeting point on the crossing of ley lines, and apparently the semen of a virile man. I'm not sure about the last element, but I'm sure all will become clear.\n\nI sit on the cold earth in the centre of the elaborate platform I have drawn in virgin spilled blood, with the book in front of me, and chant the words I have learnt in the dead of night for weeks, until they could roll off my tongue like quicksilver as they do now. The candles drip where they burn with green flames and the wax runs onto the grass, cooling instantly in the misty air. Moonlight shines on my face, breaking out from cloud, at the moment I finish chanting. Everything is going exactly to plan, second to second as the book describes.\n\nNow comes the, well, more strange element, but who am I to second guess old dark magic?\n\nI drink the semen from the crystal vial, mixed with my own blood. Nothing happens.\n\nI drop the glass to the ground and flick through the book with shaking fingers. This isn't right! The world should have \"turned upside down and dragged the cruel fingers of Life through my body\", then \"borne the Dead from the legs of the Caster\". The Lord has not returned. There is no body rising from at my feet, no clawing at the soil. I feel nothing, no sensation expect roiling panic. This is useless, the book must be wrong, too old for proper magic working.\n\nI stand up, adjusting my balls where the material of my ceremonial robes has rubbed and itched against them. My feet feel swollen and sore and my legs shake, most likely from sitting for such a long time. I'm famished from the spell work as well - I need some chocolate to re-energise me.", "They looked into the dying sun, not strong enough to darken their eyes. The fires of airships scourged the earth about them and rent apart the few buildings that remained, not tall buildings, only five stories at most, but in these moments the height of humanity. Planes fell as meteorites to the corrugated planet, shaking it lightly like the two lovers quivering atop a promontory before the city. In an unreal fury man shot at one another, no longer caring for tomorrow or any future; it was man untrammeled from passivity, fear, doubt but most of all from judgment. The air thinned. Few breaths were left, and with each sacrifice they fed not their own lungs but the fires of a galactic suicide. The lovers, wrapped in each other's arms, waited for the last bombs to drop.", "I wake up. Eyes glassy and blurry. Blinking a couple of times seems to have helped regain my sight. Trying to get up, I stumble against a tree only to notice my lack of garments and a blinding headache. \"What's happened to me?\" I ask to no one in particular. As I grab my head I felt a wet sticky substance ooze from an obvious cut on my forehead. Looking at my fingers it takes a second to focus my eyes. I recognize the red liquid as blood. Confused I said to myself \"Blood? How did this happen?\" The last thing I remember was... .was... .nothing! I can't remember anything. I started to panic as I realized I didn't know where I was. I looked around slowly and saw a vast open space of trees and tall dry grass swaying in the hot breeze. Suddenly I felt my nakedness.\n\nRegaining my balance I inch forward a few paces and trying my best to cover my self from any unwanted gazers. I kick something! I jump back afraid something would attack me. This makes my head throb and I wince. I look down to see a shape partially hidden in the grass. A shape I didn't expect to see out here. A wooden sword laid on the ground in a way that an untrained eye would miss. The broad \"blade\" of the sword and the small one handed hilt were covered in grass that had overtaken it. Slowly I bent at the knees so my head wouldn't hurt anymore than it did, I grabbed the hilt and heard a small voice talking to me. Or at least I think it was talking to me. \"Congratulations. You have received your first weapon.\" The voice seemed soft and very feminine.", "I hate to say it, but I think I'm getting bored just playing with geology. I mean, it was super great for a while there, it really was! Just a few millennia ago I paged back through my diary to try to recapture some of that joy I had at first, but it's just not happening anymore.\n\nLuckily, I have something new! This is great! That soup of amino acids is getting super interesting now. Actually, they're not just amino acids anymore. Or even just proteins. They seem to be organizing together into little... things. I've never seen anything like it. This is most intriguing; I hope they stick around so I can see what else they'll do.\n\nSpeaking of which, I wonder what would happen if I made them self-mobile...", "The Price of Fame\n\nIn the bustling city of New York, where skyscrapers pierced the sky and dreams came to life, there lived a young and ambitious social media influencer named Maya. With over a million followers on Instagram, she had built a brand around her impeccable fashion sense, razor-sharp wit, and enviable lifestyle.\n\nMaya's feed was a curated showcase of her glamorous adventures, from champagne-fueled parties to exotic getaways. Her fans couldn't get enough of her, and brands clamored to collaborate with her. She was the epitome of online success, and her bank account reflected it.\n\nOne day, while strolling through the trendy boutiques of SoHo, Maya stumbled upon a quaint little thrift store. Amidst the eclectic array of second-hand items, she spotted a vintage dress that caught her eye. The store owner, an elderly woman named Rachel, greeted her with a warm smile.\n\nAs Maya tried on the dress, Rachel noticed the Instagram influencer's transformation from a titan of social media to a relatable, humble individual. Maya confided in Rachel about the pressures of maintaining her online persona, the constant scrutiny, and the fake relationships she'd formed to stay afloat.\n\nRachel listened intently, nodding her head and making supportive noises. When Maya finished speaking, the elderly woman smiled and said, \"My dear, you are not the first person to fall into the trap of external validation. But I'll share a secret with you: true happiness lies not in the number of likes you receive, but in the people and experiences that bring you genuine joy.\"\n\nMaya laughed, thinking Rachel was being naive. \"You don't understand, Rachel. This is the life I've worked for. This is fame, and fame is what matters.\"\n\nRachel nodded again, her expression unwavering. \"I do understand, Maya. But fame is a fleeting concept. Once you've reached the top of the pedestal, where will you go from there? You'll be like a garden without water \u2013 your beauty will wither away, and you'll be left with nothing but ashes.\"\n\nMaya dismissed Rachel's words, convinced that she was just an old woman who didn't grasp the power of social media. But as she looked at the vintage dress she'd fallen in love with, she felt a pang of doubt. Perhaps there was more to life than just her online persona.\n\nWeeks went by, and Maya's online presence continued to boom. But the conversation with Rachel lingered, echoing in her mind like a gentle whisper. One day, while scrolling through her feed, Maya noticed something peculiar \u2013 all the faces in her photos began to blur together, their smiles morphing into identical masks. The perfection she'd once strived for now felt suffocating.\n\nMaya made a decision that shook the foundations of her online empire. She shut down her Instagram account, deleted her association with brands, and cancelled her upcoming appearances. Her fans panicked, wondering what had happened to their beloved social media influencer.\n\nAs Maya disappeared from the virtual world, she began to reconnect with the real one. She started volunteering at a local children's hospital, rediscovered her passion for painting, and forged genuine friendships with people who didn't care about her online fame.\n\nIt wasn't easy; there were times when Maya felt lost and alone, wondering if she'd made a huge mistake. But with each passing day, the air around her grew fresher, the colors brighter, and the laughter more contagious.\n\nMaya realized that Rachel's words were prophetic: fame was indeed a garden without water. And now, she was cultivating a new garden, one that would bloom with the warmth of meaningful connections, genuine creativity, and the peace that came from living life untethered to the whims of social media.\n\nMoral: True happiness lies within the beauty of simplicity, genuine relationships, and a life well-lived \u2013 not in the numbers or praise of strangers on the internet.", "Here is the story with the requested changes:\n\n\nIn the small town of Ashwood, nestled between the misty mountains and the whispered woods, death was not an absolute end. The air was alive with stories of loved ones returning, brought back by the unwavering devotion of those who carried them in their hearts and in their wombs. For in this peculiar place, the dead could be resurrected, but only through the sacred bond of motherhood.\n\nNo one knew how this mystical phenomenon began, but everyone knew the rules: a deceased soul could only be revived if a living person bore them in their body, literally giving birth to the deceased once more. This extraordinary rebirth was achieved through a process known as \"the Zygotic Psalms,\" where upon conception, the fetus absorbed the memories, essence, and life force of the deceased, imbuing them with the passing loved one's energy.\n\nAva Green's life had been shattered by the loss of her partner, Zebulan, who was suddenly taken from her in a mining accident. When two candles burned out on his grave, signaling the end of the two-year mourning period, Ava was devastated. Yet, as she stumbled through the snowy woods, something stirred within her. A determined voice whispered inside her mind: \"Restore.\"\n\nOn her twenty-fifth birthday, under the silent stars of Ashwood, Ava made the solemn vow to carry Zebulan's spirit to rebirth. She began the mystical Zygotic Psalms, chanting secrets gathered from ancient town tales and recipes, which, as fate would have it, seemed to weave a makeshift sanctuary around her maternal\u2026. lovers.

I had always been fascinated by the idea of time travel, and today I had decided to take a chance. I was going to write a note to my future self, just to see if I could somehow, someway, make contact with the person I would become.\n\nI thought for a moment, collecting my thoughts, before beginning to write.\n\nDear Future Me,\n\nI hope this note finds you well. I'm writing to you today from a place of curiosity and wonder. As I sit here, I am 25 years old, uncertain about the path my life will take. I am anxious about the decisions I will make, the relationships I will form, and the triumphs and failures that lie ahead.\n\nBut I am also excited. I know that the next chapter of my life is full of possibility. I have dreams of becoming a writer, of traveling the world, and of making a difference in some way.\n\nI want to know: what will my life be like in 10 years? Will I have achieved my dreams? Will I be happy?\n\nSincerely,\nPast Me\n\nI folded the note carefully and made my way to the storage box I had designated for this experiment. I opened the lid, and, as I did, I was surprised to find a note already inside. It was addressed to me, and the handwriting was unmistakably mine - but older, wiser, and more worn.\n\nI pulled the note out, my heart racing with excitement, and began to read.\n\nDear Past Me,\n\nI know exactly what you're thinking. You're wondering if this note is really from me, if I've somehow managed to defy the laws of time and space to reach back and offer you some guidance.\n\nThe answer is yes, I have. Or, at least, I think I have. The truth is, I'm not entirely sure how this works. All I know is that I received your note 10 years ago, and it changed my life.\n\nI am now 35 years old, and I can tell you that some of your dreams have come true. I did become a writer, and I have traveled the world. But my life hasn't been without its challenges. There have been setbacks and heartbreaks, times when I felt like giving up.\n\nBut through it all, I have learned to be resilient. I have learned to take risks and face my fears. And I have come to realize that the path I have taken, though it may not be the one I expected, is the one that has led me to where I am today.\n\nYou're going to face some tough decisions in the years ahead. You're going to doubt yourself and wonder if you're on the right path. But trust me, you are. You are stronger than you think, and more capable than you ever imagined.\n\nAnd as for happiness? Well, that's a complicated thing. There will be times when you feel like you're on top of the world, and times when you feel like you've hit rock bottom. But the truth is, happiness is a choice. It's something you can cultivate, something you can work towards every day.\n\nSo, I want to leave you with a piece of advice. Don't be afraid to take the leap. Don't be afraid to fail. And don't be afraid to choose happiness, no matter what challenges come your way.\n\nSincerely,\nFuture You\n\nI sat back in my chair, my mind reeling with the implications of what I had just read. I felt a sense of awe and wonder, mixed with a little bit of fear. But most of all, I felt a sense of hope. Hope that the choices I made today would lead me to a brighter tomorrow. Hope that I would find the courage to take the leap, to pursue my dreams, and to choose happiness.", "I stared blankly at my paycheck, trying to make sense of the numbers and letters etched onto the paper. It was a ritual I performed every month, with the same results: utter confusion. I couldn't recall what I did to earn this money. My memories of the previous month were hazy, with vast chunks missing.\n\nAs I gazed around my apartment, I felt like a stranger in my own life. Everything seemed familiar, yet foreign. My brain was a sieve, with all the details of my daily routine \u2013 my job, my colleagues, my tasks \u2013 having slipped through the holes.\n\nI tried to recall my morning routine, but my mind drew a blank. Did I wake up early or sleep in? Did I grab coffee or head straight to...wherever it was I went? The amnesia was frustrating, but I'd grown accustomed to it. I'd learned to adapt, to live in a state of permanent limbo.\n\nMy disappearing act happened every weekday, like clockwork. I'd wake up at 6 a.m., get dressed, and head out the door. But as I left my apartment, something would trigger, and I'd lose all recollection of the next eight hours. It was as if I was sleepwalking through my day, with no awareness of what I was doing or where I was going.\n\nOn Mondays, I'd often find cryptic notes on my desk, reminders of meetings or appointments. Fridays would bring a sense of unease, as if I was on the cusp of remembering something, but it always remained just out of reach. The weekends were a welcome respite, a time when I could momentarily forget about my mysterious occupation.\n\nToday was no different. I sat down at the kitchen table, staring blankly at the check, trying to spark some memory, any memory. My thoughts swirled, but nothing solidified. I knew I had to accept that this was my reality \u2013 a life lived in scattered fragments.\n\nAs I stood up to put the check in the bank, I noticed a small notebook on the counter. It was a new one, with a title page reading \"Episode 5 \u2013 MedTech Corporation.\" My heart skipped a beat. Could this be the key to unlocking my memories?\n\nI sat back down and began to flip through the pages. The handwriting wasn't mine, but the words seemed...familiar. I read about test subjects, confidentiality agreements, and procedural protocols. A job title leapt off the page: \"Lab 17 Technician.\" Suddenly, images began to flash in my mind's eye \u2013 a sterile lab, the soft beeps of equipment, and the sense of a critical task being performed.\n\nI read on, greedy for more information. The notebook revealed glimpses of a job that was both precise and menacing. I felt a shiver run down my spine as the truth began to take shape: I was involved in something secretive, something that required me to wear a mask of forgetfulness.\n\nThe notebook ended abruptly, as if the writer had vanished mid-sentence. I closed my eyes, the memories lingering, taunting me. How long would I remain trapped in this cycle of forgetfulness? Would I ever remember what I truly did for a living? The paycheck stared back at me, a monthly reminder of the eternal mystery that was my life.\n\nFor now, I'd just have to accept the checks and live with the uncertainty. But I was no longer content to simply exist in the void. I vowed to find a way to reclaim my memories, to shatter the secrecy surrounding my occupation. The episode was far from over; the next chapter was about to begin.", "I ended up in the past. Alone. I\u2019d been in a sandbox at school. I still remember that. And how my bones felt like they were frozen solid, but my skin burned like lava. Even after the ECT, I remember being in that sandbox. I didn\u2019t want to remember, but I did. I didn\u2019t want to know how painful it must have been for my mom to get that call from my school telling her that her son had Tripped.\n\nWhen I got picked up by the orphanage, a few days after my Trip, they thought I was crazy so I got shipped to some new place called the Insane Hospital. But I wasn\u2019t the only one who remembered the future. This man Jerry said he was from a time period a little after mine. He spoke of cars, vast highways, skyscrapers, and hoverboards. Some things I remember, other things I didn\u2019t know. But Jerry was always nice until they finally gave him the lobotomy.\n\n\"Never tell anyone about the Trip, Keith.\" He told me before getting carted away. I wish I had followed his advice. Even he couldn\u2019t keep his own secrets, as he criticized the science and rational of our asylum. He spilled the beans to one of the nurses, who put him through ECT. It didn\u2019t work. When he got back from the lobotomy he said he couldn\u2019t remember anything from before. I remember it so well, because it was one of the days Dorothea Dix had come to visit too. I liked Miss Dix because she always believed me.\n\n\"Miss Dix, come talk to this boy.\" One of the nurses said to her, as she wheeled Jerry outside for \"suntime\". \"He seems to have suffered from the same conditions of our friend Jerry here.\"\n\nShe leaned over to me. \"Why hello young man. Would you like to tell me about what you remember before the orphanage picked you up?\" She was such a nice lady. She didn\u2019t like it when the nurses deviated from the treatment plans she set out. She thought we could just get better if we were just treated like normal people. I was normal. They were crazy.\n\n\"The buildings, and the cars. So many cars. My mom and dad both had a car. I remember being in the backseat. And we had a TV\u2014this thing that you could see other people with, but it was all schedules and nice, just like our lives, but other people\u2019s for us to watch. Like looking into someone\u2019s brain while they read a book.\"\n\nShe looked at me with sympathy, a condescending glazed look one usually gives a crazy person. I just wanted to be back in that sandbox, but the truth is I don\u2019t know what my life would\u2019ve been like. But I didn\u2019t want to be a swiss-head like Jerry.\n\n\"That\u2019s quite an imagination you\u2019ve got there, sweetheart\" she told me. \"And you heard this from Jerry too?\"\n\nI remembered Jerry\u2019s advice. \"I guess so. I don\u2019t know. I think so.\" I told her.\n\nWe talked a bit more until she left. I never saw her again. It took a long time for everyone to believe that I\u2019d tightened screws made loose from the orphanage, and appropriating Jerry\u2019s stories for myself. I wish Miss Dix had seen a TV, but I was just too far in the past. I tried to remember the sandbox, but after all these years in the Insane Hospital, I just didn\u2019t want to remember dark spot in my mind\u2014the future was my secret past, one I kept so close I just can\u2019t even remember what were Jerry\u2019s memories and what were mine.", "The 225th - Part One\n \nMy mother-in-law Sarah has always been a bit eccentric. After I lost my job at the mine over a year ago, we've had to rely on her to help us with our mortgage until we're able to get back on our feet. Her financial assistance comes with a catch \u2013 we must spend Sunday afternoons with her. Today she is making us take her bomb shelter shopping. She is convinced that President Trump will result in World War III and that she needs to be prepared.\n \n\"This one looks really nice,\" Sarah says.\n \nThe five bedroom, 2500 sq ft \"Extreme Lux\" bomb shelter model, priced at what Sarah describes as, \"a moderate $2.1M dollars,\" has one of the most beautiful interiors I've ever seen.\n \n\"Bob's bomb shelters does not disappoint,\" Sarah continues.\n \n\"You can't get the real experience unless we close the hatch,\" says the shelter salesman. The salesman, whose name I didn't catch when we arrived, proceeds to close the hatch to the bomb shelter. I can feel a tingle down my spine as he closes it and my claustrophobia creeps in. Sarah and Karen proceed to tour the shelter, while I try to calm myself and catch my breath. Just when I feel like I have collected myself \u2013 BANG.\n \n\"Wow \u2013 they really take the sales experience seriously here,\" Sarah exclaims.\n \nI too think to myself that this must be an elaborate sales tactic of Bob's bomb shelters, but then I turn to look at the salesman. His face is one that I've seen before. It's the same face as my former colleagues when a large portion of the mine that we worked in collapsed and left us stranded underground for two weeks. It's the face of absolute fear in an uncertain and terrifying future.\n \n\"What the hell just happened, this isn't fake is it?\"\n \n\"The hatch and walls have the best soundproofing money can buy... this can't be happening,\" the salesman whispered under his breath.\n \nFilled with fear, Karen ran to the hatch and immediately started to unlock it.\n \n\"DO N'T DO IT! THERE'S LIKELY BEEN A NUCLEAR BLAST!\" the salesman screamed.\n \nKaren ignores his words and proceeds to open the hatch. She looks up at the sky and a big smile crosses her face.\n \n\"Everything looks fine to me - the sky is as blue as ever!\" she says joyfully.\n \nWe all breathe a collective sigh of relief and exit the shelter. Everything on the outside looks fine, but none of us can discern where the noise came from.\n \n\"I've had enough excitement for one day, we're going home to watch the game.\"\n \nSarah and Karen agree and we get into the car. After about two minutes of driving, we notice that there is a stalled car in the middle of the highway. Proceeding slowly, I drive around it, noticing that there is no one in the car or around it. It didn't take long before we pulled up to another eight cars, each of which seem abandoned in the same fashion. I pull the car over to the side of the road in an effort to make some sense of this.\n \n\"Sarah, Karen, could you please check your phones to see if we can find out if anything's happened?\"\n \nWe soon realize that none of our phones have service.\n \n\"Perhaps there's something on the radio,\" Karen says.\n \nAfter scanning for stations, the only available station is W97.5FM \u2013 country radio. Much to our surprise, it was n't country music that was playing but the U.S. Emergency Alert System. After a long unsettling monotone signal, a warning message came across.\n \n\"The following message is transmitted at the request of the Federal Government of the United States. There has been an unknown biological attack on the United States. Current estimates indicate that the 97% of the population has been eliminated by this attack. We are urging any survivors to go immediately to the closest government shelter.\"\n \nAfter listening to the entire message in horror, we realize that the closest identified shelter in the alert is nearly 100 miles away. After about an hour of trying to grasp the gravity of the situation, Sarah and Karen make their respective positions clear.\n \n\"We should go back to Bob's bomb shelter in case there's another attack. We'll be safe there,\" Sarah insists.\n \n\"The government shelter is only a 100km mom, we should go there instead,\" Karen says.\n \nWe debate where to go for some time, but Karen and I ultimately accept Sarah's plan. We arrive at Bob's and quickly notice that the salesman is frantically moving metal boxes into the \"Extreme Lux\" bomb shelter model.\n \n\"Hey Bob! Can we talk for a minute,\" Sarah shouts.\n \nThis was the first time that I realized that the salesman is the \u201cBob\u201d in \u201cBob's bomb shelters\u201d. Bob proceeds to ignore Sarah's calls and continues to stock up the shelter. As we get closer, Bob quickly runs into his single trailer office which is on the lot. After a few seconds, Bob comes out with a rifle aimed towards us and cocks it.\n \n\"You need to leave right now. There's no room for ya' all here,\" Bob yells.\n \nIt becomes clear that Bob has heard the announcement and is aware of the situation.\n \n\"I'm warning you, if you come any closer I'll kill ya!\"\n \n\"I'm sure there's plenty of room for all of us in one of your shelters. Please let us in,\" Sarah pleads.\n \n\"I only have enough supplies for me for two years. I'm not going to spread them across three more people who I dunno.\"\n \nKaren steps forward and yells, \"you can't treat people like this... you need to let us in.\"\n \nAs I move to try to grab her and pull her away from Bob \u2013 BANG. Bob fires his rifle, hitting Karen directly in the chest.\n \n\"I... I told you I'd do it. Get away from here or else I'll shoot again\"\n \nSarah and I begin to scream hysterically as we watch Karen begin to bleed out. I quickly pull Karen's bloody body back into the car and Sarah joins her in the back seat.", "It was a busy Friday evening at Bella Vita, the cozy Italian restaurant in the heart of Little Italy. The aroma of freshly baked bread and simmering tomato sauce wafted through the air, making everyone's stomach growl with anticipation. Amidst the hustle and bustle, a petite, silver-haired lady, Rosa, walked in, her eyes scanning the room for the party she was supposed to attend. She spotted the sign: \"Big Vinny's Birthday\" and made her way to the table.\n\nUnbeknownst to Rosa, there were two events listed as \"Big Vinny's Birthday\" that evening. The actual birthday party was a lively gathering of family and friends, with balloons, streamers, and a giant cake in the center of the table. On the other hand, the meeting of mob bosses, disguised as a birthday party, was a more subdued affair, with suits, cigar-smoking men, and an air of mystery.\n\nRosa, innocently, walked up to the wrong table, where the mob bosses sat, sipping their whiskey and discussing \"business.\" The men, caught off guard by the unexpected interruption, raised an eyebrow as Rosa chirped, \"Happy birthday, Big Vinny! I brought you a little something!\" She handed over a wrapped box, revealing a homemade cannoli cake.\n\nThe room fell silent. The mob bosses exchanged uneasy glances, unsure how to react. Big Vinny, a burly man with a thick beard, rubbed his temples, attempting to stave off a headache. \"Uh, grazie, uh, Mrs...?\"\n\nRosa beamed. \"I'm Rosa, Big Vinny's... neighbor! I've brought your favorite dessert!\"\n\nThe men around the table shifted uncomfortably in their seats, making room for Rosa as she plopped down in the empty chair. The awkward atmosphere was suddenly filled with Rosa's effervescent chatter about her \"famous\" cannoli recipe and her cat, Mr. Whiskers.\n\nAs Rosa continued to regale the table with stories, the mob bosses struggled to maintain their tough facade. Their smiles turned from forced to genuine, and their conversations soon turned to their own family traditions and favorite foods. For one surreal evening, the lines between organized crime and Italian hospitality blurred.\n\nMeanwhile, the actual birthday party, just across the room, was in full swing. Big Vinny, the other one, laughed and sang with his friends and family, oblivious to the hilarious mix-up.\n\nAs the evening wore on, Rosa remained at the table, chatting amiably with the mob bosses, who found themselves enjoying the old lady's company. As they bid their farewells, Big Vinny handed Rosa a wad of cash, saying, \"For the cake, ma'am. You have a real talent. Maybe next time, we'll make it a real birthday party, capisce?\"\n\nRosa, with a mischievous twinkle in her eye, left the restaurant, feeling a strange, inexplicable connection to the rough-around-the-edges men. She looked forward to her next surprise visit, perhaps to celebrate a promotion or a successful business merger.\n\nFrom that night on, whenever Rosa noticed a \"wrong number\" or an awkward encounter, she smiled knowingly, thinking, \"Ah, that's just Big Vinny's way of bringing a little joy into the world, one delicious cannoli at a time!\"", "I stood frozen in front of the kitchen table, my eyes fixed on the extra chair. It was a simple, sturdy thing, with a plain wooden frame and a padded cushion. But to me, it was a harbinger of change, a sign that my solitary existence was about to be disrupted.\n\nFor as long as I could remember, I had lived in this sanctuary, a protected enclosure designed to preserve the last remnants of my kind. I was a human male, one of the few remaining males of a species that had once thrived on this planet. But that was before the Great Upheaval, a catastrophic event that had pushed my kind to the brink of extinction.\n\nI had grown up in this sanctuary, surrounded by the gentle care of the Guardians, a group of powerful beings who had taken it upon themselves to preserve and protect the last remnants of humanity. They had taught me everything I knew, from the basics of language and mathematics to the intricacies of human culture and history.\n\nBut despite their best efforts, I had always felt a sense of disconnection, a nagging sense that something was missing. I longed for the company of my own kind, for the sound of a human voice that wasn't filtered through a comms device or a servitor's programming.\n\nAnd now, it seemed, that wish was about to come true.\n\nThe knock on the door was hesitant, almost tentative. I felt a surge of excitement mixed with trepidation as I made my way to the entrance. I hesitated for a moment, wondering if I should open the door myself or wait for the Guardians to intervene.\n\nBut something about the situation felt different, felt like this was something I needed to do on my own. I took a deep breath and opened the door, revealing a figure I had never seen before.\n\nHe was a young man, with a messy shock of brown hair and a scattering of freckles across his nose. He looked nervous, his eyes darting back and forth as he took in his surroundings. And yet, despite his obvious unease, there was something about him that seemed...familiar.\n\n\"Hello,\" he said, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\nI stared at him, unsure of how to respond. No one had ever greeted me like that before. No one had ever looked at me with that mix of curiosity and uncertainty.\n\n\"Hello,\" I replied, the word feeling strange and awkward on my tongue.\n\nThe young man smiled, a tentative smile that seemed to suggest he wasn't quite sure if he should be smiling or not. \"I'm...I'm Adam,\" he said.\n\nI nodded, feeling a sense of wonder wash over me. \"I'm...I'm Eryndor,\" I replied, using the name the Guardians had given me.\n\nAdam's eyes widened in surprise. \"You're...you're a human,\" he said, as if he couldn't quite believe it.\n\nI nodded again, feeling a sense of pride and wonder at being recognized as one of my own kind.\n\nAnd with that, the door to my isolation swung wide open, admitting a warm flood of light and possibility into my life.", "The skies were ablaze with the fiery breath of dragons as the armies of Eridoria and Nefaria clashed on the battle-scarred plains of Mor'Dhul. The war had been raging for years, fueled by a deep-seated hatred between the two nations. For generations, their people had been sworn enemies, each side convinced that their way of life was the only true path.\n\nAt the head of the Eridorian army stood the legendary warrior, Arin the Unyielding. His bronze armor gleamed in the sunlight, adorned with the symbol of his people: a proud eagle soaring upwards. Arin's sword, Drag\u00f3nka, hung at his side, its blade etched with the words \"Victory or Death.\"\n\nOpposing him was the dark sorceress, Lyraea of Nefaria. Her raven tresses cascaded down her back like a waterfall of night, and her eyes burned with an inner fire that seemed to consume the very air around her. At her command, a host of shadowy creatures writhed and twisted, their bodies like living darkness.\n\nAs the two armies met, the earth trembled beneath their feet. The sound of drums and the thunder of hooves filled the air, accompanied by the clash of steel on steel. Arin charged forward, his sword flashing in the sunlight as he carved a path through the Nefarian ranks. Lyraea countered with a wave of dark magic, her sorcery summoning forth swarms of razor-toothed imps and nightmarish abominations.\n\nDespite being outnumbered, the Eridorians held their ground, their shields locked in a formidable wall that repelled the Nefarian horde. Arin fought his way through the enemy lines, his drag\u00f3nka slicing through armor and flesh alike. He dueled with Lyraea's champion, a towering giant of a man wielding a hammer as large as a tree trunk. The two warriors clashed, their blows shaking the earth, until Arin emerged victorious, the giant's hammer lying shattered at his feet.\n\nLyraea, enraged by her champion's defeat, unleashed her most devastating spell yet. A maelstrom of shadowy energy erupted from her outstretched hand, threatening to engulf the entire Eridorian army. But Arin stood firm, his sword raised high as he channeled the power of the land itself. The earth responded to his call, forging a bulwark of stone and steel that repelled Lyraea's magic.\n\nThe tide of battle began to turn in favor of the Eridorians. Lyraea's creatures faltered, her magic weakened by Arin's defense. The Nefarian lines wavered, their soldiers fleeing in panic as the Eridorians pressed their advantage.\n\nAs the last of the Nefarian army fell, Lyraea stood alone, her dark magic swirling around her like a vortex of despair. Arin approached her, his sword still trembling with the force of the battle. For a moment, the two enemies locked eyes, their hatred and exhaustion palpable.\n\nAnd then, in a flash of insight, Lyraea understood. The war, the bloodshed, the endless cycle of hate \u2013 it was all for nothing. The true enemy was not the Eridorians, but the darkness within themselves. She let her magic dissipate, her eyes clearing of the madness that had driven her for so long.\n\nArin, sensing the shift in Lyraea's demeanor, stayed his hand. Instead of delivering the killing blow, he offered her a choice: to stand down and work towards a lasting peace, or to face trial for her crimes. Lyraea, her mind freed from the grip of darkness, chose the former.\n\nAs the dust settled on the battlefield, the two former enemies walked away from the carnage, side by side. Their people would never forget the horrors of Mor'Dhul, but perhaps, one day, they would learn to forgive. And Arin, the Unyielding, and Lyraea, the Reformed, would become legends in their own time, symbols of the power of redemption and the enduring will to peace.", "I still don't think this is a good idea... Steve said to no one in particular as he worked on his laptop. General Walker gave him a cold stare from across the room.\n\n\"Dr. Hayes, we've explained this *countless* times to you. We are in the middle of an energy crisis and Hell is a renewable source!\"\n\nSteve closed the lid of his laptop and looked at the General through thick-rimmed glasses. \"Now I'm not a religious man, Walker, but I do believe Hell exists. I also believe it would be a very bad idea to rip a big hole in dimensional space-time to go charging in. I mean, for all we know our weapons will do nothing against the Armies of the Damned.\"\n\nA door at the far end of the room opened and a young scientist poked his head in. \"Er, General, Doctor, We're ready to start.\"\n\nGeneral Walker Grinned and picked up his planner. Steve sighed and carried his laptop out the door. It was a short walk through the confined tunnels of the bunker to the portal room. This portal to hell wasn't particularly dramatic or fancy - just a huge ring of magnets at the end of an underground 30 mile loop. Steve sat down at the centre control panel and plugged his laptop in. He was flanked by other scientist and military manning other consoles. General Walker gave orders to officer present, who either left the room or relayed the orders to NCOs.\n\n\"We're ready to go, Dr Hayes. Press enter and let's get started.\"\n\n\"It's not that - oh hell there's no point in explaining,\" Steve typed some commands into the console and the emergency lights came on. \"Ten seconds and we'll open a portal to Hell, General, I hope you're happy.\" He sat back and crossed his arms.\n\nMoments later, soldiers wheeled in a large crate and placed it in front of the portal. Steve sat bolt upright then turned to General Walker \"What the *hell* is that, Walker?\" The General chuckled.\n\n\"Your worry about our weapons being ineffective isn't totally unfounded, Dr. Hayes. But I doubt even The Damned can withstand the destructive force of a nuclear bomb.\"\n\nThe portal formed with a bright flash, a rippling black screen now filled the ring of magnets. The soldiers pushed the bomb through the portal before retreating behind blast shields. Moments later, the portal bulged out and there was an audible thud.", "The whine of the engine and the scream of the gearbox above his head was calming in a way. The sound he became so familiar with in these last few years was, for him, a sort of security. All those missions have almost always ended with a pickup in an MH-60 Black Hawk helicopter. He would usually shoot the shit with the pilots and they'd explain to him how the helicopter was able to fly, for the most part he got the hang of the basics. Engine drives the main gear box, that drives the rotor that produces lift. The tail rotor is needed to counter the torque that the turning of the rotor produces on the helicopter body. Every time he would ask about something new to take his mind of the missions for a while, it was almost like meditating to him. His thoughts about the helicopter were suddenly interrupted by the voices in his headphones.\n\n- \"Just want to warn you we're approaching some clouds that might give us rain and maybe lightning so close the sliding doors.\", as soon as the pilot said that he turned and closed the left door, he nodded to the man on the other side and he closed the left.\n\n- \"Why don't we go around them?\", the team leader sounded a bit annoyed or nervous maybe. He knew the commander didn't like flying.\n\n- \"It's a squall line, we don't have enough fuel to go around it and it's too high to climb above it.\"\n\n- \"How bad is it?\"\n\n- \"Not sure, but buckle up..definitely...\", the pilot sounded nervous.\n\nHe looked back to see what Commander Teagan was doing and all of the sudden the helicopter pitched forward, then yawed violently throwing him out of his seat and into the side of the fuselage. He felt as though he was in a roller coaster from hell. A light began to fill the helicopter, \"lighting strike\", he thought to himself. He started feeling strange, he felt as though every little piece of him was slowly drifting apart and as the light intensified that feeling grew. He couldn't hear anything anymore, the engine, the rotor, nothing was making a sound or... he just didn't hear it. Is this what it feels like to die? Everything slowed down for a minute, he couldn't even move his eyes. At this point he would panic but everything seemed so unreal. As fast as that feeling came, it disappeared. The helicopter started spinning again and he looked around to see some of his team in their seats while others had been thrown around like him. A voice crackled in his headphones \"BRACE FOR IMPACT!\". Brace, brace against what? He just closed his eyes and for the first time in his life he prayed.\n\nWell that's the intro, if you like what I've written so far I can continue.", "As I entered the hall, the large and intricately carved stone doors shut behind me. I began to walk down the path laid out before me, in awe of the legendary artifacts that surrounded me. To my left a well polished shield hung on the wall, to my right there was a leather quiver filled with silver tipped arrows. I continued down the ancient corridor, passing many weapons. I remember every last one of them; there was a spear as long as I was tall, a hammer that looked too heavy to be held up by the earth itself. There was a pair of identical daggers, their ancient blades emitting a faint black aura, and there was a scythe with a silver blade that bore the inscription \"My enemies the gods may reap, I merely carry their scythe\".\n\nThese items were the tools of the ancient chosen warriors, hidden away in the legendary hall of chosen warriors. Every step I took down the corridor meant giving up the chance to use the weapons I passed, for I must press forward if I hoped to gain my own legendary item.\n\nEventually I reached the end of the hall and knew which one would lend me its power. On the back wall of the corridor, there were no weapons hanging; instead there lay a sword in a pedestal directly in front of the wall. I recognized the sword instantly, it was my sword; I had forged it with help from my closest friend, who was a skilled blacksmith. How could it be here!? The instant I thought this, a mysterious voice came from my blade. \"A warrior doesn't come here to find a new blade, instead they come here to realize that they already have their legendary weapon.\" Without hesitation, I picked up my blade and was comforted by the familiar weight in my hand. With my sword in hand, I turned and left the corridor, ready to take on the darkness that I must face.", "The forest was intensely quiet, as quiet as it hadn't been in a while. The silence made the world close in softly, and the only thing to punctuate that was the occasional snap of twigs underfoot or the heftier cracking of bone.\n\nThere were a lot of bones.\n\nThere had always been bones. It was a sort of tradition, the kind spoken of in only the most hushed of tones. The forest provided an end for those who would take it - it called out and they answered. There was no stop that could be put to it, as the locals had once learned, and as had been confirmed in the last days. Before then, there used to not be so many bones.\n\nFarther in, the ground became liberally peppered with white. Fewer and fewer twigs were the source of the crunching underfoot, and after walking farther the pale sky to be glimpsed through the canopy had a mirror in the carpet of remains from which the trees climb upward. It was hard to keep solid footing at this point, but it was not not much farther - the growing heaps of remains were a testament to that. Only the stronger folks had made it this far in, it looked like, and small scraps of clothing could still be seen amongst the field of remains.\n\nThe hill of bones crested to reveal a wide clearing, a gradually sloping pit in the dead thicket. Far away in the middle could be spotted a small ring of mossy stone untouched by the bone field. It was not too long of a walk, and more detail came into view. Several gnarled stones stood sentinel around a pedestal with something atop it. It was a large totem of some squatting figure clutching an hourglass between its legs, its mouth a teeth-baring rictus. From its off-center position it was evident that it had been disturbed once already. One small nudge, perhaps it had even been accidental, from a careless hiker or curious soul - one was enough though. Such a small action, with such large consequences.\n\n\"It's not wise to reach out for the totem. There's a reason the inner circle is devoid of bones.\"\n\nStill, the forest calls.\n\n(I got a bit fanciful with this, sorry if this was intended to be solely realistic)", "As a child, I would often stare at objects, willing them to move with my mind. I'd try to fly off the couch, flapping my arms like a bird in hopes that I'd miraculously lift off the ground. My parents would chuckle and tell me to stop being silly, but I couldn't shake the feeling that there was something special within me, waiting to be unlocked.\n\nAs I grew older, the attempts became less frequent, but the fascination never fully went away. In my teens, I'd lightly test the waters again, just for old times' sake. I'd try to read minds, predict the future, or even heal a minor cut on my hand with a mere thought. Nothing ever seemed to happen, and I'd shrug it off as a silly childhood fantasy.\n\nBut here's the thing: something was happening. Every single time.\n\nIt wasn't until my 25th birthday, when I was rummaging through old photo albums with my parents, that I stumbled upon a cryptic entry in my childhood diary. The scribbled words were from when I was six years old: \"Today I made the ball move with my mind! I was hiding in my room, and I really concentrated, and it rolled under the bed all by itself!\"\n\nMy mom smiled, \"Oh, you must have meant that you pushed it accidentally!\"\n\nBut a strange sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu washed over me. That wasn't what I had meant at all. As I flipped through the pages, I found more entries, each describing a successful attempt at something extraordinary. The pattern continued throughout my childhood and even into my teenage years.\n\nI began to re-examine my memories, searching for any clues that might have been hiding in plain sight. That time I \"accidentally\" skipped a stop on the bus? I now realized I had been willing the bus to take a detour to avoid being late for a birthday party. The countless times I \"guessed\" the correct answers on tests without studying? I had been unknowingly tapping into a dormant psychic ability.\n\nIt turned out that my attempts had been working all along; I had simply been ignoring or downplaying the successes, attributing them to luck or coincidence. My whole life, I had been using my superpowers without realizing it.\n\nThe revelation hit me like a ton of bricks. I stared at my hands in wonder, feeling like I'd been living in a dream world. All those times I thought I'd been pretending, I was actually channeling a deeper part of myself.\n\nThe thrill of discovery gave way to a mix of emotions: excitement, confusion, and a pinch of embarrassment at how oblivious I had been. But most of all, I felt grateful for this second chance to understand and harness my hidden abilities. I was eager to explore the limits of my powers, to see how they could be used for good, and to learn more about this incredible, secret part of myself.\n\nAs I closed the diary, I couldn't help but wonder what other surprises lay hidden in the pages of my life. But one thing was certain: I would never stop checking, never stop exploring, and never stop believing in the extraordinary potential that lay within me.", "The world had always known the delicate dance between life and death. Every individual from birth was assigned a unique Date of Passing, imprinted on a small, silver wristwatch that strapped around their wrist like a vein of destiny. Mine read: June 15th, 2023, at precisely 8:47 AM.\n\nGrowing up, I treated my Date of Passing with a mixture of curiosity and fear. Some kids would glance at their wrists constantly, while others made a game out of guessing how they'd meet their maker. I tried to steer a middle course, taking calculated risks and making deliberate choices with the understanding that my time was limited.\n\nYears flew by, and the Date of Passing loomed closer. Friends and family members had their fair share of passings, some expected, others sudden and without warning. But one thing was certain: Death always kept his promises. Each life played out its predestined script, ticking down to that final, fatal moment.\n\nJune 15th, 2023, crept up like a shadow. My watch beeped insistently at 8:44 AM, counting down the final minutes. I'd prepared myself, said my goodbyes, and stood outside the coffee shop where I spent my last evening, savoring one final sip of familiarity. Close friends kept me company, but their attempts at distractions were feeble; we all knew what loomed ahead.\n\n8:47 AM arrived, and nothing happened.\n\nConfused glances met nervous chuckled. The tension that had built up was released in a burst of panic. I stared at my wrist in shock, the watch now silent, as if chuckling at the absurdity of it all.\n\nWe scrambled for answers. Did I get an extension? Was there a clerical error? Did I somehow break the rules? Questions that normally had clear, rehearsed responses now swirled in disarray. Reaching out to authorities only led to awkward pauses and lower-level officials unsure of what to tell me.\n\nSome gawked, thinking I'd stumbled upon a plot from the gods. Some demanded explanations, yet didn't truly want to know. A trifle imputation slipped into the whispers, hinting that I might have somehow cheated or negotiated an extension \u2013 unthinkable given the discreet governance of Death's Council.\n\nWeeks became months. It was then I realized that, despite inaction, expectations imbued each daily activity. Mortals treated me like the oddest, unexampled mystery in town. Bystanders forecasting and castle-building judgment paradoxically strayed toward offering silence rather than solace.\n\nTime passed, but this time had no definition.

She had dedicated herself to uncovering its secrets, and her life's work had taken her deep into the heart of the jungle. Her latest expedition was no exception. With a team of experts, she set out to explore the farthest reaches of the rainforest, seeking to discover new species that had never been seen before.\n\nAs they trekked through the dense foliage, the sounds of the jungle grew louder. The chirping of birds, the rustling of leaves, and the distant roar of a waterfall filled the air. Maria's team had been warned about the dangers of the jungle, but she had always been drawn to the unknown. The thrill of discovery was what drove her.\n\nAfter days of traveling, they finally reached the banks of a crystal-clear river. The water sparkled in the sunlight, and the sound of its gentle flow was almost soothing. Maria's team set up camp, and she began to unpack the equipment they would need for their expedition.\n\nAs she ventured into the jungle, Maria stumbled upon something that made her heart skip a beat. It was a strange, metallic object protruding from the earth. She called out to her team, and they gathered around, awestruck.\n\nThe object was a pod, unlike anything Maria had ever seen before. It was sleek and silver, with intricate etchings on its surface. As they examined it closer, the pod began to glow with a soft, blue light.\n\n\"What is this?\" Maria's team leader, Dr. Patel, whispered, his eyes wide with wonder.\n\nMaria hesitated, unsure of what to say. She carefully reached out and touched the pod, and suddenly, the jungle around them came alive. Trees swayed, and creatures scurried about, as if responding to some unseen command.\n\nA low hum filled the air, and the pod's glow intensified. A holographic display flickered to life before them, displaying images of the rainforest in breathtaking detail. Maria's team watched in stunned silence as the display depicted the interconnectedness of every living thing in the jungle.\n\n\"This is incredible,\" Maria breathed. \"It's some sort of advanced technology, far beyond anything we have today.\"\n\nAs they continued to watch, the display shifted to reveal schematics and diagrams of futuristic machines. Maria's team struggled to comprehend the sheer scale of the technology. It was as if they had stumbled upon the remnants of a long-lost civilization, one that had harnessed the power of the jungle in ways they could hardly imagine.\n\nThe pod, sensing their fascination, opened with a gentle hiss, revealing a console with glowing buttons and levers. Maria, with her background in zoology, couldn't resist the urge to explore.\n\nWith shaking hands, she reached out and pressed a button. The console came to life, displaying a menu of options that defied their understanding of science. The team watched in awe as Maria selected an option, and a section of the pod swung open, revealing a hidden chamber.\n\nInside, a series of capsules hung suspended, each containing a living creature from the jungle. Maria's eyes widened as she recognized a bird species thought to be extinct. The capsules glowed with a soft, pulsing light, and the creatures within seemed to be... learning.\n\n\"This is impossible,\" Dr. Patel whispered. \"This is... advanced engineering.\"\n\nMaria's mind reeled as she grasped the implications. The technology before them was capable of manipulating the very fabric of life. They had stumbled upon a secret, hidden away in the heart of the Amazon, a secret that could change the course of human history.\n\nAs the team cautiously explored the pod and its contents, Maria couldn't help but wonder: What other secrets lay hidden in the jungle, waiting to be discovered? And what lay ahead, now that they had uncovered this incredible technology?", "The Unaware Adversary\n\nIn the bustling streets of modern-day Manhattan, a man named Daryl went about his day like any other. He donned a sharp black suit, carried an umbrella to ward off the perpetual rain, and sported a charming smile that won over clients at his high-stakes job as a financial advisor. But amidst the chaos of the concrete jungle, Daryl felt an inexplicable void. He was missing something, but he couldn't quite put his finger on what it was.\n\nAs he dodged pedestrians and hailed a taxi, a peculiar whisper seemed to echo in his mind. It was always there, a soft and raspy voice, offering cryptic advice and twisted encouragement. \"Make the deal, Daryl. Squeeze every last penny from the transaction. The world is yours for the taking.\" The voice had always been a part of his life, but lately, it had grown louder, more insistent.\n\nOne stormy evening, as Daryl descended into the subway tunnels, he stumbled upon a peculiar bookstore. The sign above the door read \"Curios and Tomes.\" Out of curiosity, he pushed open the door and stepped into a dimly lit world of dusty tomes and ancient artifacts.\n\nThe shopkeeper, an eccentric old man with a knowing glint in his eye, introduced himself as Samuel. He listened intently as Daryl recounted his life story and the persistent whisper in his mind. Samuel's expression transformed from curiosity to grave concern.\n\n\"Daryl, my friend,\" the old man said, his voice laced with a mix of sorrow and fear, \"I believe you may be unaware of a vital truth. You see, there are certain...Beings in this world, forces that inhabit realms both seen and unseen. Some say you are one of them.\"\n\nDaryl laughed, dismissing the idea as superstitious nonsense. But Samuel's next words sent a shiver down his spine.\n\n\"You, my friend, are the best representative of entropy and darkness that this world has seen in centuries. Your name is synonymous with the destructive tendencies of humanity. In some cultures, they call you the 'Morning Star,' but I'll refer to you as...Lucifer, the Unaware.\"\n\nDaryl's mind reeled as he stumbled backward, away from the revelation. Lucifer? The fallen angel? The embodiment of evil? No, it was impossible. He was just a regular guy, working to make ends meet and live a comfortable life.\n\nAs the storm outside intensified, Daryl fled the bookstore, his sanity on the brink of collapse. He had always felt an emptiness, a void within. Now, it had a name \u2013 or rather, a title. Lucifer.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and Daryl became increasingly paranoid. Strange visions haunted his dreams: hellish landscapes, wailing souls, and an eternal throne of burning coals. The whisper in his mind had transformed into a cacophony of voices, urging him to claim his throne and unleash chaos upon the world.\n\nYet, a glimmer of goodness within Daryl refused to die. He started questioning his actions, reevaluating the consequences of his decisions. The lines between his ambition and malevolence began to blur.\n\nAs the inner turmoil raged on, Daryl found himself facing an inconceivable choice: to accept his role as Lucifer and succumb to the darkness or defy his supposed nature and forge a new path. Samuel, the wise old man, reappeared, bearing an answer to Daryl's doubts.\n\n\"You see, Lucifer, the Unaware,\" Samuel said, a gentle smile on his face, \"your existence doesn't define your actions. You can choose to use your unique... capabilities for good or evil. The world is yours to shape. The question is, which master will you serve?\"\n\nWith a new understanding, Daryl realized that his very identity had become a mirage. He decided to defile his supposed nature, embracing a new path that would allow him to wield power without succumbing to darkness. The whispers in his mind quieted, and for the first time in years, he felt at peace.\n\nThe Devil, Lucifer, or simply Daryl, finally understood that his greatest power lay not in his ability to destroy, but in his capacity to choose \u2013 and thus, to be something more.", "If we were to gather all the people in the world, each distinct voice would be as insignificant as a drop in the ocean. Among the tide of people that ebb and flow through their ordinary lives, how are we to ever be sure that we can truly reach one another, especially while withstanding the crashing waves? This is a tale of the bond that began on a fateful evening...\n\n\"No, it's not. There isn't any sort of bond between the two of us.\"\n\n\"I agree. As if there was any way that I would associate with the likes of him.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, but what are you implying?\"\n\n\"I'm simply stating the truth. I would never permit myself to go through the degradation of being in the company of a man as detestable as you.\"\n\n\"While it may astonish you to hear this stated forthright, I needn't bother throwing away my pride in order to satiate your undeserving ego. In fact, I find the very idea of the two of us as a pairing excruciatingly nauseating.\"\n\nWait just one moment, the both of you. This tale isn't anything so unstable that any one person would be able to go against it. This has been decreed by fate, and the order of events must follow in the sequence that they were written.\n\n\"With all due respect, Storyteller, I have no intention of finding myself in the company of this frigid shrew.\"\n\n\"I should be the one who is insulted by this sudden turn of events. Imagine, someone of my status being subjected to this harsh punishment.\"\n\n\"I would never pine for someone who risks injury from having her nose turned up so high.\"\n\nDespite what you say, the events that lay before you have already been determined, and there is nothing that will change that. With the utmost respect to our audience, I intend to present the story of these two sharp tongued lovers.\n\nNathaniel, age 19, comes from an impoverished family. It was through destined circumstances that he found himself before the Imperial Court, asking the King to reconsider the station of troops and depletion of supplies from his village. Here, he came to know Emilia, age 17. Though she has been promised to the prince from a neighboring country, she found herself drawn to the youth who dares to defy his own king. Nobody would have expected love to bloom between these two, especially when neither one is willing to lower themselves before the other.", "The entire continent is Rome, the northern tip of the one below it is also Roman. Below that trading kingdoms and tribes. To the east lay the kingdoms of Persia, China, and Mongolia. There lay more tribes as well. That was the world up until recently was the Mayzta came from the Great Sea bringing with them new goods to trade and strange new concepts.\n\nThat doesn't concern me though, Caesar deals with those matters. As the Pontifex Maximus I must prepare for the coming religious event, the Day of Divus Julius and anniversary of Caesaris astrum passing. The Colosseum requires preparation for the sacrifice of descendents from the the Conspirators. That was one of the things I could appreciate of the Mayzta, sacrifice to appease their pantheon. Silly reasons though, animals suffice unless it's for Divus Julius. His is a special reason though, the Conspirators killed a god and their bloodlines will forever pay.\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nVery brief as I'm tired and it's late. I can expand on it later on after I've slept.", "The sun had just set over the bustling city, casting a warm orange glow over the towering skyscrapers. In a small alleyway, a fluffy white dog named Max sat panting, waiting for the clock to strike eight. It was a ritual he had grown accustomed to, for it signaled the start of his nightly transformation.\n\nAs the last rays of sunlight disappeared, Max felt a strange tingling sensation wash over his body. His fur began to recede, his ears shrunk, and his limbs lengthened. In a matter of minutes, he stood on two legs, a fully formed human with a dazed expression.\n\nThe curse of the witch, cast upon him as a mischievous puppy, had been a constant fixture in his life. For one hour each night, Max was doomed to roam the streets as a human, forever trapped in his canine mind.\n\nAt first, it had been overwhelming, the sights and sounds of the city too much for his primitive brain to handle. But over time, Max had grown to enjoy his nocturnal escapades. He loved walking among humans, watching them go about their business, and observing the strange customs they adhered to.\n\nTonight, Max donned a wide-brimmed hat and a scarf, attempting to blend in with the crowds. He strolled through the park, marveling at the street performers and the smell of roasting hot dogs wafting from the food vendors. As he walked, he found himself drawn to the sounds of laughter and music emanating from a nearby nightclub.\n\nWithout hesitation, Max pushed open the door and slipped inside. The bouncer, taken aback by the awkward newcomer, hesitated for a moment before shrugging and waving him in. Max's eyes scanned the room, taking in the flashing lights and swirling bodies on the dance floor.\n\nAs he made his way to the bar, he noticed a young woman, sitting alone with a phone in her hand. Her eyes sparkled as she caught him staring, and Max, unaware of social norms, wagged his hips in a strange, canine manner.\n\nTo his surprise, the woman giggled and waved him over. \"Hey, mister... um, what's with the weird dance moves?\"\n\nMax's face lit up, and he let out a goofy grin. \"Woof... I mean, um, hello!\"\n\nThe woman, whose name was Sarah, chuckled and handed him a glass of beer. As they chatted, Max found himself lapsing into dog-like behavior \u2013 barking at the songs he liked, pawing at the air, and in one instance, attempting to lick Sarah's face.\n\nTo his surprise, she laughed and joined in, playfully chasing him around the club, and spinning him around on the dance floor. For the first time since his transformation, Max felt truly human, connected to another being on a deep level.\n\nAs the hour drew to a close, and his body began to shift back into its canine form, Max's eyes locked onto Sarah's, a hint of sadness lingering beneath their shared laughter.\n\nWith a chant and a flick of her wrist, Sarah whispered something that sounded suspiciously like \"maybe next time, pup?\" as Max disappeared into the night, his transformative magic already waning.\n\nBack in the alley, he waited for the sun to rise, contemplating the next evening's adventure. The witch's curse lingered, a reminder that, even as a human, his heart remained that of a loyal canine.", "Scene cuts to a top level view of a high school\n \nA high school, one of the most diverse and challenging ecosystems on the planet.

Emma settled into her seat, her eyes gazing blankly out the window as the suburban streets gave way to the highway. She didn't want to be on this bus. In fact, she had done everything in her power to avoid it.\n\nThe destination, a small town in the middle of nowhere, was a place Emma had sworn she'd never return to. Her childhood home, filled with painful memories and toxic relationships, held no appeal for her. Yet, here she was, headed straight back into the heart of her least favorite place.\n\nAs the bus rolled on, the scenery outside the window becoming increasingly dull and familiar, Emma's thoughts turned to her past. She had left that town, vowing never to return, and had built a new life for herself in the city. But life had a way of unraveling, and now her parents were elderly and in need of care. Emma's siblings had long since abandoned the family, leaving her as the sole responsible party.\n\nThe bus driver's monotone voice came over the intercom, announcing their next stop. Emma glanced out the window, watching as the bus pulled into a crumbling gas station. The driver, a gruff but kind-eyed man, stood up and stretched, his joints creaking in protest.\n\n\"You okay back there, miss?\" he asked, eyeing Emma in the rearview mirror.\n\nEmma nodded, though she wasn't okay at all. She was trapped on this bus, headed to a place she didn't want to be, with no clear escape route. The bus driver returned to his seat, his eyes returning to the road, but Emma noticed that the bus didn't budge. It just sat there, idling, as if waiting for something.\n\nOr someone.\n\nAs the minutes ticked by, the bus remained stationary. Passengers began to stir, asking the driver when they would continue on. He just shook his head, saying, \"We'll get there when we get there.\" The air grew thick with tension, and Emma realized that she was the holdup.\n\nIt wasn't until she looked within, acknowledging the root of her resistance, that the bus began to move. The acceptance, though reluctant, was enough to break the impasse. The engine roared back to life, and the bus exited the gas station, continuing on its journey.\n\nWith each passing mile, Emma felt a subtle shift inside. The weight of her resistance began to lift, replaced by a sense of resignation, and eventually, acceptance. The bus ride, once an interminable slog, became a catalyst for self-reflection and growth. Emma's thoughts turned from bitter recollections to the realization that she had been given a second chance.\n\nAs the bus finally pulled into the small town, Emma felt a sense of resignation wash over her. But this time, it wasn't the desperate, trapped feeling of before. It was a quiet acceptance, a recognition that this was where she needed to be. The bus ride, it seemed, had been about more than just getting from point A to point B. It had been about the journey within.\n\nWith a newfound sense of purpose, Emma gathered her belongings and stepped off the bus, ready to face whatever lay ahead. The town, once a place of pain, now held the promise of redemption, and Emma was prepared to confront it head-on.", "I sat alone in the dimly lit coffee shop, nursing a lukewarm cup of coffee and staring blankly at the laptop screen in front of me. The words I had been trying to write for hours had started to blur together, and my mind was a jumbled mess of writer's block and anxiety. Just as I was starting to doze off, I felt a sudden touch on my shoulder.\n\nI spun around, expecting to see the barista come to refill my cup, but instead, I saw my best friend from childhood, Emma. We had grown apart over the years, each going our separate ways after high school, but every now and then we'd bump into each other around town. I hadn't seen her in months, and yet, here she was, sitting next to me with an urgent look in her eyes.\n\n\"Hey, what's going on?\" I asked, feeling a mix of surprise and concern.\n\nEmma hesitated, her eyes darting around the coffee shop before settling back on mine. \"Can I talk to you for a minute?\" she asked quietly.\n\nI nodded, my curiosity piqued, and Emma took a deep breath.\n\n\"I have something to tell you,\" she said, her voice barely above a whisper. \"Something that's going to change everything.\"\n\nMy mind started racing with possibilities. Was she getting married? Had she lost her job? Was she sick? I couldn't think of anything that would warrant such a dramatic buildup.\n\n\"What is it?\" I asked, trying to keep my voice calm.\n\nEmma leaned in, her eyes locked on mine. \"I'm your sister,\" she said, the words dropping like a bombshell.\n\nI felt like I'd been punched in the gut. My entire world seemed to tilt on its axis as I stared at Emma in shock. \"What do you mean?\" I stammered, my mind reeling with questions.\n\nEmma took another deep breath before explaining. It turned out that Emma was the product of an affair between my father and another woman. My parents had kept it a secret for years, and Emma had only recently discovered the truth. She had been searching for her biological family for months, and when she finally found me, she had been too scared to reach out.\n\nI sat there, stunned, as the pieces started to fall into place. The similarities between us that I had always written off as a coincidence \u2013 the same laugh, the same eyes \u2013 it all made sense now. I had a sister. A sister I had never known existed.\n\nThe weight of this revelation settled on me, and I felt like I was drowning in a sea of questions and emotions. But as I looked at Emma, I saw a kindred spirit, a person who understood me in a way that no one else ever had.\n\n\"Welcome to the family,\" I said finally, tears streaming down my face as Emma wrapped me in a tight hug.\n\nIn that moment, our lives were forever changed. The secrets of the past were finally laid bare, and we were given a second chance at a relationship that had been hiding in plain sight all along. As we sat there in stunned silence, the world around us came alive, full of possibilities and new beginnings.", "I stood in the dimly lit, worn wooden confessional booth, the scent of old incense wafting through the air. My hands trembled as I grasped the small, intricately carved wooden grille that separated me from the listening ear on the other side. I took a deep breath, steeling myself for the revelation that had haunted me for so long.\n\n\"It's time I spoke of it,\" I whispered, my voice barely audible over the pounding of my heart. \"This is my confession.\"\n\nThere was a pause, a moment of stillness as the listener on the other side of the grille composed themselves for what was to come.\n\n\"Tell me, child,\" a soft, gentle voice encouraged, \"what is it that weighs so heavily on your conscience?\"\n\nI closed my eyes, and let the memories wash over me like a tidal wave. The images, the sounds, the emotions \u2013 all came flooding back, just as vivid and raw as the day they occurred.\n\n\"It was the summer of 1995,\" I began, my voice cracking with emotion. \"I was 17, carefree, and invincible. My friends and I would often sneak into the old abandoned house on the outskirts of town. We thought it was the ultimate thrill \u2013 trespassing, exploring, and getting away with it.\"\n\nI paused, collecting my thoughts, as the listener remained silent, attentive.\n\n\"One night, we decided to take it to the next level. We snuck out after dark, our flashlights casting eerie shadows on the walls. We crept through the dusty halls, our laughter and shouts echoing through the empty rooms. And then, we stumbled upon the room.\"\n\nMy breath caught in my throat as the memory came alive.\n\n\"It was a small, locked room in the attic. We picked the lock, and inside... oh, inside... we found something terrible.\"\n\nMy words faltered, and I took a deep breath before continuing.\n\n\"A collection of photographs, taken by the house's former occupant. They depicted \u2013\" I hesitated, choosing my words carefully \"\u2013 a young girl, about my age. She was... she was in situations that no child should ever be in.\"\n\nI felt a surge of tears, but pushed through.\n\n\"We were so misguided, so wrapped up in our own stupidity. We thought it was cool, a forbidden secret that only we knew. But it was just... wrong. And we didn't do anything. We didn't report it, didn't tell anyone. We just left.\"\n\nThe silence on the other side of the grille was oppressive, heavy with understanding.\n\n\"You've carried this with you all these years,\" the listener noted, their voice soft with compassion.\n\nI nodded, even though I knew they couldn't see me. \"Every day, I've lived with the guilt of knowing what I saw, and doing nothing. I've built a life, a family, and a career, but that moment has always lingered, a reminder of my own helplessness.\"\n\nAs I finished speaking, the tension in my chest began to dissipate, like the air escaping from a balloon. The confessional booth seemed less confining, and the shadows outside less ominous.\n\nFor the first time in decades, I felt the weight of my confession lifting. Not because it excused my actions, but because I had finally acknowledged the pain, and promised to make amends.\n\nAs I prepared to leave, the listener's gentle voice offered one final phrase: \"Remember, my child, redemption begins with confession.\"\n\nAnd with those words, I emerged from the confessional booth, blinking in the bright light, free to begin a new chapter in my life.", "I trudged through the muddy field, my eyes fixed on the dilapidated barn in the distance. A crooked sign hung above the entrance, creaking in the wind: \"Eternal Bliss Church\". I snorted. Eternal Bliss, my ass. This place looked more like Eternal Squalor.\n\nI had been investigating this cult for weeks, and the more I learned, the more I was convinced that it was the shittiest cult in the world. For one thing, the leader, a self-proclaimed prophet named Brother Bob, had a penchant for getting into altercations with the local farmers over whose turn it was to use the communal tractor.\n\nAs I approached the barn, I noticed that the door was open, revealing a dimly lit interior that reeked of mold and stale air. I stepped inside, my eyes adjusting slowly to the darkness. The air was thick with the smell of sweat and patchouli.\n\nA group of devotees, clad in threadbare robes, sat cross-legged on the floor, eyes closed, hands clasped in prayer. Brother Bob stood at the front of the room, a beatific smile plastered on his face.\n\n\"Welcome, brother,\" he said, his voice dripping with false sincerity. \"We've been expecting you. We have been chosen to share our message of love and redemption with the world.\"\n\nI rolled my eyes. This guy was a joke. I had researched his background, and it turned out that he had spent more time in jail for tax evasion than he had spent studying theology.\n\n\"So, what's the big message, Brother Bob?\" I asked, trying to sound interested.\n\nHe grinned, revealing a missing front tooth. \"We believe in the power of excessive dairy consumption to bring about spiritual enlightenment.\"\n\nI blinked. \"Excessive dairy consumption?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, his eyes sparkling with conviction. \"Milk, cheese, yogurt \u2013 the more, the merrier. It's the key to unlocking our higher selves.\"\n\nI looked around the room, half-expecting to see a group of people with giant milk mustaches and wedges of brie lodged in their braids. Instead, I saw a bunch of malnourished looking individuals who seemed to be nursing hangovers.\n\nI shook my head. \"You know, Brother Bob, I think I've seen enough.\"\n\nAs I turned to leave, I noticed a faint mooing sound coming from the back of the barn. I followed the sound and found a small cow tied to a post, its eyes regarding me mournfully.\n\n\"Ah, Bessie,\" Brother Bob said, his voice softening. \"Our sacred cow. We believe she holds the secrets of the universe within her loins.\"\n\nI threw up my hands. \"That's it, I'm out of here.\"\n\nAs I made my way back to the entrance, I heard Brother Bob calling after me. \"Don't worry, brother \u2013 you'll come crawling back when the rapture comes! Mark my words \u2013 it'll be a tidal wave of gouda that brings about the end times!\"\n\nI stuffed my ears and made a run for it, certain that this was indeed the shittiest cult in the world.", "Xanthea\n\nIn the year 2256, humanity had finally achieved the unthinkable \u2013 our presence in the cosmos was undeniable. Colonies thrived on multiple planets, our interstellar trade routes hummed with activity, and our scientists continued to push the boundaries of the unknown. But it was on the planet Xanthea, a stunning celestial body teeming with life, that our greatest discovery awaited.\n\nAs the United Galactic Coalition's (UGC) flagship, the Aurora, entered Xanthea's orbit, Captain Elara Canton stood on the bridge, her eyes fixed on the swirling clouds of iridescent gases enveloping the planet. She felt a mix of excitement and trepidation \u2013 Xanthea was the last of the so-called \"ancient\" planets to be explored.\n\nThe landing party, comprising experts from various UGC nations, descended onto Xanthea's surface, with Elara leading the way. Their goal was to unravel the secrets hidden within the planet's labyrinthine ruins, rumored to belong to the oldest civilization in the galaxy.\n\nUpon breaching the entrance, the team was met with a chamber filled with ancient artifacts, and an introduction to the writing system of the ancient Xantheans. It was a logarithmic-based language that couldn't be deciphered by even the most advanced AI linguists.\n\n\"It's as if they knew we'd get here eventually,\" said Dr. Aidan Kalatrava, the team's chief linguist, puzzling over the inscriptions. \"This is a calling card, a message from the earliest galactic civilization.\"\n\nThe team made rapid progress, unraveling the syntax and accentuating elements that ultimately led to an astonishing revelation. The Xantheans had witnessed the birth of stars and the dance of galaxies. They had spanned hundreds of thousands of years, updating their civilization with every new phase of the universe's growth.\n\nTheir prosperity and definitive peak as the oldest civilization was what they left for posterity: boundless blueprints for sustainability, chemical and quantum secrets propounded far ahead of their time.\n\nHowever - their greatest legacy lay in something simpler.\n\nStriking a sound crystal, embedded into an archaic symphony player, brought an ending song from twilight sounds merged together, in ululating little wipe.

The cities were designed with gleaming white spires and iridescent domes that refracted the sun's rays into a kaleidoscope of colors. The inhabitants of Elyria, known as the Solars, lived in harmony with the constant sunlight, their skin a warm, golden brown. They built sprawling gardens filled with rare, sun-loving flora that bloomed in every color of the spectrum.\n\nThe Solars were a joyful people, always celebrating the sun's presence. They held grand festivals during the peak sun hours, with feasts, music, and dance. Their architecture was designed to harness the sun's energy, with solar collectors and heat-resistant materials that absorbed the intense radiation. Over time, the Solars developed a spiritual connection with the sun, worshiping it as a life-giving deity.\n\nOn the other side of the Earth, the dark side, known as Nyx, was a realm of eternal night. The landscape was rugged and unforgiving, with twisted rock formations and jagged mountains that pierced the black sky like shards of glass. The inhabitants of Nyx, known as the Umbra, lived in a world of shadows and dim luminescence. They built cities that floated on the darkness, with lanterns and bioluminescent organisms that provided the only light.\n\nThe Umbra were a mysterious people, adapted to the darkness. Their eyes had evolved to be highly sensitive, and they navigated the shadows with ease. They developed a unique culture centered around the night sky, with astronomers who charted the movements of the stars and planets. The Umbra were master craftsmen, weaving intricate patterns into fabrics that shimmered in the faint light. They were also skilled hunters, tracking the nocturnal creatures that roamed the dark side.\n\nDespite their differences, the Solars and Umbra developed a symbiotic relationship. The Solars traded their excess energy, generated from the sun, to the Umbra in exchange for rare minerals and night-blooming flowers. The Umbra, in turn, shared their knowledge of the night sky and their expertise in navigation. Over time, a bridge of commerce and culture was established between the two sides, with merchants and travelers crossing the terminator, the narrow strip of land where the sun's rays met the darkness.\n\nHowever, tensions rose as both sides began to exploit the other's resources. The Solars, reliant on the Umbra's minerals, started to encroach on their lands, disrupting the delicate balance. The Umbra, feeling besieged, retaliated by restricting trade and limiting the Solars' access to their night-sourced products.\n\nA young Solar named Aria, a skilled astronomer, and an Umbra named Kael, a charismatic leader, crossed paths at the terminator. They discovered a shared passion for understanding the unique properties of their respective worlds. Aria, fascinated by the Umbra's adaptations to the darkness, joined Kael on a journey across the night side. As they traversed the shadows, Aria marveled at the bioluminescent flora and fauna, while Kael revealed the intricate social structures of the Umbra.\n\nTheir meeting sparked a new era of cooperation between the Solars and Umbra. Aria and Kael, with their knowledge and vision, forged a new path forward, one that recognized the interdependence of the two sides. The Solars and Umbra formed a joint council, the Terrastellaria, to ensure the sustainable coexistence of both worlds.\n\nThe Terrastellaria's symbol, a stylized representation of the Earth, with the sun on one side and the stars on the other, became a beacon of hope for a brighter, more balanced future. As Aria and Kael stood together, watching the stars twinkle in the night sky, they knew that their world, though forever divided, was now whole.", "The Colony on Gliese 765 was founded 475 years ago today! screeched the announcement on the speaker. The official name for the planet was Gliese 765b, but everyone here called it Coin, as in two sides.\n\n\"Happy Foundation Day!\" screeched in follow up, and the familiar patriotic music followed that was ignored by everyone. Max looked out the window of his office, which had an impressive view of The Curtain. And saw the relentless winds blow some paper into the sun.\n\nCoin was tidally locked, and the hot side, which never knew night, was where everyone's power came from. Max's job was to monitor the transmission lines that fed power to the night side where everyone lived. Power was cheap, and life on Coin was all about the size of your heater. The Curtain was where the two side met, and was constantly being pounded with gale-force winds as the light and dark sides of Coin worked to balance the temperature on the planet.\n\nHardly anyone lived on the bright side, it was too hot and oppressive, but the people who worked on the solar arrays there managed to have a few little air-conditioned burgs. Most days, Max was bored. The power lines were established hundreds of years ago and were over-engineered. They were not efficient, but it didn't matter, there was never a shortage of light from the horrible red star and like usual, all the lights were green. The power lines never went down, but occasionally did develop noise that could create power surges, but Max hardly ever saw signs of that.\n\nBy the time the Foundation Day tune stopped, Max had grown bored of watching the winds of the Curtain buffet a pair of workers as they got into their cab of the monorail. Their destination one of the many cities on the night side, to be sure. Max's shift didn't end for hours. maybe he would cheat a bit and watch a vid. He wasn't supposed to, but when the Supervisor wasn't around, the only person in the facility was himself.\n\nMax had been watching an old series about Earth. Earth was a proper planet that had day and nights and weather and a moon and a star that didn't look like a boil. Not that anyone ever heard from Earth much anymore, apparently for the past couple of hundred years, there was some sort of ecological disaster there, Max didn't know the details, it didn't matter, the vid's story was set from before the Diaspora when electricity wasn't discovered yet. Max watched it with a longing that he felt in the deepest parts of himself. There were animals, green grass, and women who's only concern in life was which wealthy man they wanted to marry. The world just supported them, not like on Coin, where every inch of life needed to be taken from the light side and carved out of the ice on the dark side. Max liked to imagine himself as a farmer.\n\nThere was an alarm. It was strange to hear, because Max had previously only heard it on training vids. He looked over at the console and saw that there was no power on his lines. Something had gone terribly wrong. There was no power! Max tripped the alarm and got on the phone with his contact at Solar Array 42. It rang and picked up.\n\n\"Steve! Steve! Are you there? What is going on?\"\n\n\"Max! They've set off bombs!\" Steve replied. \"They are shutting down the power to all of Coin!\n\n\"Who?\" Max yelled the question. The lights from the street outside started to go out.\n\n\"They call themselves The Liberation Army of Gelise. They are-\" the line went dead.\n\nMax looked up and the lights went out in the office as well. The only light coming from his badge and communicator. Outside his window, the only light was being belched from the north, all power was off. Max knew from his training, how much time there was to restore power before the night side froze, 3 days. Max also knew without the monorail, nobody from the night side was going to be able to get to the borderlands, where you could live if you could stand the winds.\n\nMax knew what he had to do, if Coin was going to survive, he needed to get the power back on.", "Narrator ( Arnold Schwarzenegger ) : D'AHH !

Everything cast in a blue gray. I walked around, but could not make anything move, not even the paper. I was certain now, I was dead.\n\nEventually I look up, and there it is, shining through the roof and the frame and the ceiling, The Light. The Proverbial light that everyone talks about. I found I could swim up towards it. It was more difficult to fall back down, but that is heaven, that is where souls go.\n\nI swam a ways and saw my house down below, cars puttering down the street, neighbors mowing their lawns. I swam a ways farther and I could see my city, and it seems the farther I swam the easier it became to swim, and the farther I could swim. Up and Up.\n\nEventually the whole earth was below me, and not soon after it was just another star. The light remained the same, but everything shrank beneath me. Soon even the stars grew closer together behind me. Then they began to dim. All the while the light remained.\n\nWhen it comes your time don't go to the light, don't fall for it the way I did.

It was said that in a long-forgotten era, the gods themselves walked among humans, sharing their divine essence with those who sought it. And now, after centuries of searching, I had finally found the path to become one of them.\n\nMy name is Eryndor Thorne, and I was once a humble scribe, scribbling away in the dusty libraries of a forgotten kingdom. But as I delved deeper into the ancient tomes, I became increasingly obsessed with the idea of transcendence. I spent years pouring over forbidden texts, practicing arcane rituals, and seeking out forgotten relics. And finally, the day arrived when I stumbled upon the mysterious Scroll of Ascension.\n\n\"The prophecies said that on the summer solstice, a mortal would find the scroll and embark on the perilous journey to become a god.\" The scroll itself was an enigma, written in a language that seemed to shift and writhe like a living snake. But I, fueled by determination and madness, was determined to unlock its secrets.\n\nAs I began to decipher the scroll's cryptic messages, I underwent a series of trials, each one designed to push me to the limits of human endurance. I walked through burning deserts, braved the harshest of storms, and even stumbled upon hidden temples guarded by fierce, otherworldly creatures. With each trial, I felt my mortal form begin to weaken, but my spirit grew stronger, like a flame that burned brighter with each challenge.\n\nYears passed, and the trials only grew more relentless. I faced my own demons, manifest as twisted illusions that sought to break my resolve. But with each victory, I gained new insight into the mysteries of the universe. I began to see the intricate web of fate that bound all things, and I understood the delicate balance that governed the cosmos.\n\nFinally, on the night of the next summer solstice, I reached the threshold of the Ancient Ones' realm. The air was thick with an otherworldly energy, and I could feel the pulse of creation itself. Before me stood the guardian of the threshold, a being of pure light, her eyes burning with the essence of the stars.\n\n\"You have come to claim godhood, Eryndor Thorne,\" she said, her voice like music from the heavens. \"But are you prepared to pay the price?\"\n\nI hesitated, for a moment, realizing the enormity of what I was about to undertake. But the fire within me burned too bright to be extinguished. I nodded, and the guardian vanished, revealing the pathway to the divine.\n\nAs I ascended, I felt my form begin to unfurl, like a lotus blooming in the mortal world. I became one with the cosmos, a part of the very fabric that bound all things. I looked upon the universe with new eyes, and I saw the hidden workings of fate, the patterns that connected all souls, and the secrets that lay beyond the veil of time.\n\nI was no longer Eryndor Thorne, scribe and seeker. I was Aetheron, a god among gods, born of mortal flesh and divine fire. And as I gazed out upon creation, I smiled, knowing that my journey was but a beginning, and the tales that would be told of my name would echo through eternity.", "I sat in stunned silence as the bailiff led me into the courtroom. The solemn faces of the judge, jurors, and prosecutor seemed to blur together as I struggled to process the unthinkable. I was being accused of murder, and the \"star witness\" was the very person I was alleged to have killed.\n\nAs I took my seat, a commotion erupted at the back of the courtroom. The doors swung open, and a stretcher was wheeled in. The deceased victim, Rachel Lee, lay motionless on it, her eyes closed. But as the bailiff approached her, a faint glow emanated from her body. Rachel's eyes flickered open, and she took a shallow breath.\n\n\"Your Honor,\" the prosecutor began, \"thanks to the groundbreaking technology of Revivify Inc., we are able to bring the victim back to life for a temporary period of 24 hours to testify in this case.\"\n\nRachel's gaze locked onto mine, and a sly smile spread across her face. My heart sank. We had a... complicated history, to say the least. Rachel had been a coworker of mine at a marketing firm, and our personalities had clashed from the start. She was manipulative, cunning, and had a talent for making my life miserable. We had often butted heads, and I had made no secret of my disdain for her.\n\nBut I had never, ever harmed her.\n\nAs the prosecutor began to question Rachel, she told a tale of how I had supposedly throttled her in a fit of rage during a heated argument at the office. I was taken aback by the sheer audacity of her lies. But what really worried me was the conviction with which she spoke. She seemed so certain, so sincere, that even I began to doubt my own memories.\n\nThe prosecutor presented evidence that was shaky at best, but with Rachel's testimony, it seemed damning. My alibi for the time of the alleged murder was shaky, and I could feel the jurors' skepticism growing with each passing minute.\n\nI knew I had to think fast, to find a way to discredit Rachel's testimony and expose the truth. But as I watched her, something nagged at me. She was too calm, too collected. It wasn't like Rachel to be so... contained.\n\nAnd then it hit me \u2013 Rachel had always been a master manipulator. She had a talent for playing people, for getting them to do her bidding. But what if she was playing one final, twisted trick on me from beyond the grave?\n\nI turned to my lawyer, a fierce determination burning within me. \"I think I know what's going on here,\" I whispered. \"Rachel's not just testifying \u2013 she's getting her revenge.\"\n\nMy lawyer's eyes narrowed, and we quickly conferenced in a hushed tone. We devised a plan to expose Rachel's true intentions and shine a light on the web of deceit she had spun.\n\nAs the trial continued, I watched Rachel's composure begin to slip. The prosecutor's questions grew more pointed, and Rachel's responses became increasingly agitated. I saw a glimmer of the real Rachel, the one I had known and despised.\n\nAnd then, in a stunning turn of events, I took the stand. With a steady voice and a clear conscience, I told my side of the story. I recounted the numerous times Rachel had sabotaged me at work, the way she had undermined my confidence and turned our colleagues against me.\n\nAs I spoke, Rachel's eyes flashed with anger, and her mask slipped. The jurors saw, in that moment, the truth. Rachel was not a victim; she was a calculating, ruthless adversary who had manipulated the system to destroy me.\n\nThe prosecutor's case crumbled, and the judge finally dismissed the charges against me. As I left the courtroom a free man, I caught Rachel's gaze. For a fleeting moment, I saw the real her \u2013 a venomous, vengeful soul who had tried to use her own death to destroy me.\n\nBut I had won. I had fought back against the lies, and in doing so, I had taken away her final victory. Rachel's 24-hour lease on life expired, and she slipped back into the darkness, her malevolent spirit finally laid to rest.", "Today was *the day!* I was excited, and nervous, and I had no idea what to expect. But it didn't really matter what I wanted, because it was everyone else's big day, too.\n\nI just get to be up close.\n\nI look up into the sky, and the rest of the world does the same. And we see a glint, and then a spark. And soon, the starship's landing craft comes into view. It's falling at such a vast speed, but it looks like it's moving *so* slowly.\n\nBut soon the ship is wide, and massive. Smoke is coming off it. And I've got a front-row seat. It's strange how hot the ship is when it finally touches down on the landing pad. Fire trucks are around and they start to hose it off, which causes even more smoke to flow off the craft.\n\nMost of the press moves to the tent, waiting for the press conference, but I'm transfixed on the door. He's in there. And I finally get to meet him.\n\nAnd the door opens, and out steps my father. He's a big man, but muscular. He has a long, flowing beard, and his brown hair matches mine (in terms of its scruffiness). As he walks out of the ship, a huge amount of scientists, politicians (including the President, and Vice President), lots of military members, and crew members down at NASA all stand up for the returning hero, and begin to applaud.\n\nBut the man of the hour doesn't look at them. I see him frantically searching the area. And then he stops, looking at me. I wave at him, in a small way, and he smiles back at me in return. He walks by the reception of famous people, and walks directly over to me.\n\n\"Erik...\" was all he said to me.\n\n\"Hi Dad... Have a good time on your trip?\" I had *weeks* to come up with something better, but it was the only thing that came to me.\n\nHe laughed. He laughed so hard he had tears in his eyes, and he bent over and hugged me tight. \"Oh son, I missed the hell out of you. I'm sorry I've been away for so damn long. And I'm sorry to hear about Cassandra... Your mother was fierce, and... well I'm sorry I've been away.\"\n\nHe let me go and I just looked up at him. Not even sure what I was supposed to do.\n\nHe turned to the President who was walking toward him, with a wry smile on his face. All I could think, though, was I was number 1, and the president was secondary. *How cool is that?*\n\nI stood next to him, and I felt like a little kid again. My parents always talking to important-looking adults, and me just tagging along. I'm not *much* older, now, but hey... I'm 14. Practically an adult, anyway. But they were talking about mission parameters, and the different things he saw. After 10 minutes of talking, though, he finally looked like he wanted to get away.\n\n\"Excuse me all, I have a press conference to get to.\" He put his arm around me, and steered me through the group... and back towards the ship. \"Erik... I have a special job for you.\" He was talking to me like I was younger, but I let it slide. He *has* been gone for almost 10 years. \"Go into the ship. There's someone waiting there. And I think its better if she meet with one stranger, first. She can meet the whole damn world after. Ok? I'll see you after the conference.\" He playfully hit my shoulder, and turned, walking toward the press conference. The huge group of soldiers, scientists, and politicians all followed after him, with more things to ask. Soon I couldn't hear them, anymore. All I could hear was the wind blowing. It made me feel slightly more alone...\n\nI turned back toward the ship, and approached it. It still felt warm, but not as much as it had when it landed. The door was still open, so I simply walked inside.\n\n\"Hello?\" The inside had computers everywhere, lots of screens and lights, all blinking. I heard no response.\n\nThe cockpit had two seats. Directly behind it was a door, which opened as I approached. In here was a small hallway, which lead to another door. The ship seemed to be painted in whites and grays. The second door opened as I approached. In this back room was a set of beds. There were three, but only one was occupied. By the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen.\n\n*She's blue...* was my first thought. Her skin was very pale, and it seemed to have a tinge of blue, instead of one of rosy red, like a human. Her hair was long, and flowed down her face. It was blue, too, and it seemed to splash across her face, like a wave. She had what looked like make-up on. Red eye shadow, and her lips seemed to be enveloped in a glossy blue. I couldn't tell what she was wearing underneath the blanket, but it seemed to be skintight, as her shoulders were protruding from the blanket, and they were enveloped in some type of suit. She was wrapped up in it, like a present. Her eyes were closed, and she seemed to be fast asleep, though I never saw her move, even to breathe.\n\nI tried again. \"Um... hello?\"\n\nHer eyes opened. They were bright red, and almost glowing with light. She turned her head quickly, and upon seeing me smiled wide. \"Another human! So, we have arrived at Earth then?\"\n\n\"Uh... yeah. This is Earth. My name's Erik. My d-\"\n\n\"Erik! Oh you must be The Captain's son! He's told me all about you.\"\n\nShe got up, and I was right. Her suit seemed to be skintight. But it was strange. The suit seemed to be pulsing with light. As she breathed in, her suit got brighter, and as she breathed out, her suit became dim.\n\n\"Oh? Only good things, I hope, haha.\"\n\nHer head tilted a little. \"Of course! Why would he talk about bad things?\"\n\nI shook my head. \"Bad joke, nevermind.\"\n\n\"Oh... sarcasm, right. I'm really bad with that...\"\n\nShe shook her head now. It was so utterly human, I laughed at her. She just laughed right back.\n\n\"This is weird... So what... who are you?\"\n\nShe smiled at me. \"Ah, he hasn't said anything. Maybe I'm a surprise, hm? My name is Kenar. I am supposed to be a gift... for you! To honor Captain Zil!\"\n\nShe had such a bright way of saying it, that it knocked me off guard.\n\n\"A... gift? What!?\"\n\nShe smiled again. \"Ah, yes. The Captain did mention you would react in a strange way. On our planet, gifts like this are not common place. It is a great honor to receive, you must understand.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but... I mean you're a *person*, right? Isn't that slavery?\"\n\nI was starting to regret even coming. Not that she's not beautiful, but c'mon. She's a person!\n\n\"Slavery?\" Her head turned to the side. \"Ah, you are thinking I am being forced. No, this is not so. I am not yours to order around, nor am I forced to stay with you if I do not like. I am to be your friend, and companion. If we part, so be it. But I think we will be great friends! It is good to meet you, Erik Zil.\"\n\nShe stood up, and stretched out her hand. I took it, and she pulled me into a hug.\n\n\"Come! Let us meet the Earthlings!\" She started to run down the corridor, pulling me as she went.", "Temporal Regulation Agency\n\nIn the heart of the city, nestled between a vintage watchmaker and a quaint bakery, stood the imposing structure of the Temporal Regulation Agency, or TRA, an organization shrouded in mystery and speculation. It was here that the Institution of the National Time-Traveler Lottery, or NTN, was administered. Few knew its true purpose, and even fewer cared to ask.\n\nTo most citizens, the NTN was an innocent pastime, a chance to win a life-changing sum of money. But, in reality, the lottery was a carefully crafted trap, designed to catch time travelers from various eras who dared to meddle with the timeline.\n\nAt the helm of this clandestine operation was Director Elara Vex, a brilliant and enigmatic figure with an unwavering dedication to protecting the integrity of the timestream. Her agency had honed a sophisticated algorithm, capable of detecting anomalies in the probability fields surrounding temporal tourists.\n\nMarcus Thompson, a charming and resourceful temporal traveler from 22nd-century New Eden, had stumbled upon the NTN while exploring the ancient archives of the pre-Time War era. He had grown fascinated with this peculiar relic from a bygone era and decided to participate, thinking it would be an entertaining diversion.\n\nAs Marcus purchased his ticket, he failed to notice the discreet application of a probability anchor \u2013 a device that bound his entry to a specific temporal coordinate, making it possible for TRA to track his participation. He simply hoped to win enough money to afford a few luxury gadgets from the era.\n\nDays turned into weeks as the lottery's drawing date approached. The public anticipation was palpable, with thousands of people attending the announcement ceremony in the heart of the city. As the hosts dramatically revealed the winning number, Marcus was ecstatic; he had won.\n\nHowever, his joy was short-lived. As he approached the stage to claim his prize, he was enveloped by a tranquilizing field and whisked away by TRA agents. Awakening in a holding cell deep within the TRA complex, Marcus found himself face to face with Director Vex.\n\n\"Mr. Thompson,\" she said, her voice firm but tinged with a hint of curiosity, \"you have in all likelihood committed a serious transgression against the continuity of our timeline. We will be studying your case extensively to ensure that your actions are coherent with the predetermined course of events.\"\n\nMarcus spent the ensuing months under the intense scrutiny of the TRA, his memories of past and future meticulously recorded and analyzed. The experience pushed him to question the ambition that had driven him to engage with the lottery in the first place. As time proceeded, he found himself drawn to the enigmatic Director Vex, who was possibly more intriguing than he had initially presumed.\n\nIn the end, the trial of Marcus Thompson underscored the delicate balance of temporal activity in modern times. Though found guilty of provisional legislation, the deflection submarines venture rolling some respect toward Director urging reluctant passage underway next difficulty forgiveness about kind treatment.

During this time, he developed a begrudging respect for Director Vex, who seemed to genuinely care about preserving the integrity of the timeline.\n\nAs the investigation drew to a close, Marcus was found to have had a relatively minimal impact on the timeline, despite his numerous adventures in the past. The TRA decided to grant him a conditional pardon, on the condition that he would refrain from any further time travel and cooperate with their efforts to monitor and regulate other rogue time travelers.\n\nMarcus accepted the terms, and soon found himself working alongside Director Vex and the TRA to track down other temporal anomalies. He discovered that his knowledge of the 22nd century and his skills as a temporal traveler made him an invaluable asset to the agency.\n\nAs he worked with the TRA, Marcus began to realize that his actions had unintended consequences, and that the timeline was far more fragile than he had initially thought. He came to appreciate the importance of preserving the natural course of events, and he dedicated himself to helping the TRA protect the timeline from those who would seek to exploit or disrupt it.\n\nIn the end, Marcus found a new purpose in life, using his knowledge and skills to help safeguard the timeline and ensure that the future remained intact. And though he never forgot his adventures in the past, he came to understand that the true value of time lay not in manipulating it, but in preserving it.", "Heavenly Delivery\n\nMaria's Pizzeria was a staple in the small town of Willow Creek. The aroma of freshly baked dough and simmering sauce wafted through the air, enticing the senses of anyone walking by. Jack, a high school student, had been working as a delivery boy for Maria's for over a year. He knew the streets like the back of his hand and had delivered pizzas to every corner of the town.\n\nOn this particular evening, Jack was about to make his final delivery of the day. He grabbed the last pie from the counter, checked the address, and jumped into his rusty Toyota Corolla. The GPS led him to a nondescript high-rise apartment building on the outskirts of town. As he entered the lobby, Jack noticed something peculiar \u2013 there was no rent office, no squad of doormen, and no signs of life anywhere.\n\nHe shrugged it off, thinking it might be one of those \"Lacoste walled communities\" he'd heard about. Jack took the elevator to the 10th floor, following the GPS instructions to the letter. The doors creaked open, and he stepped into a long hallway. The air felt... light.

My name is Jack Harris, a veteran of the Great War, the war that should never have been. As I write these words, the year is 2065, and the world is still reeling from the devastation. The memories of that fateful day still haunt me, and I'm compelled to share the story of how it all began.\n\nIt started in 2014, with a Hollywood movie that caught the attention of the world. \"The Interview,\" a comedy film, was meant to be a satirical take on the authoritarian regime of North Korea. The movie's plot revolved around two journalists, played by Seth Rogen and James Franco, who set out to assassinate the supreme leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The North Korean government, already notorious for its sensitivity, saw the film as an affront to their dignity.\n\nAt the time, I was a young soldier, stationed in South Korea, just a few miles from the Demilitarized Zone. I remember the unease that spread through our ranks as we watched the movie's trailer. We all knew the North Koreans weren't exactly known for their sense of humor, and this film seemed to be poking the bear.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the movie's release only fueled the fire. Sony Pictures, the studio behind the film, faced a massive cyberattack, allegedly carried out by a group calling themselves the \"Guardians of Peace,\" who threatened to strike theaters showing the movie. The film's release was eventually canceled, but not before it had reached the attention of the North Korean government.\n\nTensions between the two nations escalated rapidly. North Korea began to test its nuclear arsenal, and the United States, bound by its defense treaty with South Korea, responded with military maneuvers of its own. China, seeking to assert its dominance in the region, began to fortify its borders and support the North Korean regime.\n\nI remember the day the missiles started flying. I was on patrol near the DMZ when the radio crackled to life, alerting us of an artillery attack on Seoul. The war had begun. In a matter of weeks, the conflict spread across the globe, as alliances were tested and nations took sides.\n\nLooking back, I realize that \"The Interview\" was just the spark that ignited a powder keg of tensions. The world had been living on the edge of chaos, and a seemingly innocuous movie was enough to push us over the edge.\n\nAs the war raged on, I fought alongside my fellow soldiers, watching as cities burned and innocent civilians suffered. We suffered countless losses, and the scars of those battles still linger.\n\nThe world as we knew it is gone. The radiation-soaked wasteland that surrounds me is a grim reminder of the devastation. The few remaining cities are mere shadows of their former selves, and the once-blue skies are now a perpetual gray.\n\nAs I write this, I am filled with regret and anger. Anger at the recklessness of the filmmakers, who underestimated the North Korean regime's sensitivity. Anger at the governments that failed to find a peaceful solution. Anger at the world for not learning from its history.\n\nAnd yet, I am also filled with hope. Hope that the few remaining survivors will learn from our mistakes and forge a new path. Hope that we can rebuild and create a world where movies are not the catalyst for war, but a symbol of peace and unity.\n\nThis is my story, a cautionary tale of how the unthinkable became a reality. I write this as a reminder to future generations, of the dangers of poking the bear and the devastating consequences of our actions.", "Lord Captain, we've made landfall!\n\"Thank you Nut, smooth landing as per usual. Geb, what have your sensors picked up?\" asked the captain of the ship, shifting to look from his navigator to his intelligence officer.\n\"Well Captain Ra, there's a class A species out there but they're in very early stages of development. I'd say their most advanced technology is the pulley. They've seen us land of course and at least three score armed men are converging on our location. They do not pose much of a threat but we may want to teach them a lesson if we plan to stay.\" states a man who appeared to look beyond his console and in fact was seeing everything for a hundred miles via his datajack, connecting him to the various probes they had released.\n\"Indeed, very astute. Send Sekhmet to intercept, have her make an example and at the same time assess the threat level of these beings.\" said the captain, pressing some buttons on the console in front of him before standing. \"I will rest for now, as should we all till Sekhmet reports back. Someone shall fetch me if anything goes wrong of course.\"\n\"Yes Lord Captain!\" reverberated the answer from his crew, setting his orders in motion before each of them retired to their own quarters. Geb tried to keep an eye on things from his quarters but the captain was right, and weariness soon overpowered him.\nOutside, Sekhmet prepared for battle. Though she was the captain's daughter, she was also the ship's peacekeeper, cybernetically augmented to protect her father and his crew. Her fur bristled under the alien sun, and her legs tensed as she sprung into a run. As she crested the nearest dunes she saw in the distance the beings she was ordered to assess, merely a quarter of her size at best and wielding crude spears she realized they would be little harm to the crew. Still an example was to be made, and she would make it.\nWading into battle she decimated the men, leaving only a few survivors. She grasped one of the few survivors in her bloody claws, lifting him to her so she might examine him further. \"You will tell the story of what happened here.\" she stated, knowing her augmentations would take care of any required translation. The man looked terrified, but there was something else there. She realized only too late that the other thing within the man was defiance as he threw his spear. It smashed into her eye and though it did not damage her vision, it was enough to damage numerous sensors there.\nSuddenly these tiny men were enormous threats, Sekhmet could not allow any of them to live and she would not. She smashed the man she held into the ground and then destroyed the remaining survivors. She then ran across the dunes towards the nearest settlements, carving a bloody swath of destruction as she moved. These beings would rue the day they sought to threaten the crew of the Solar Barge.", "The dim lights were soft against the violin. They stared at her but she seemed oblivious, like any old lady.\n\n\"What's your name ma'am?\" the young boy asked.\n\n\"Oh my, don't you remember me? I'm Mrs. Cassano. You used to come by my house everyday Vinny. You used to ride your bike and you had that squirt gun...\"\n\n\"Mrs. Cassano, I don't think this is your table. My name is Vincent but I'm not...\"\n\n\"Bah! You young people. In my days there were manners. This isn't my table. Oh Lord what did I do to deserve this? My own family doesn't want me to sit and eat. Oh Lord...\"\n\nShe was sobbing. The violins were muted and there was the stir of eavesdropping.\n\n\"Oh Lord!\"\n\nHe patted her. What could they do?\n\n\"Mrs. Castano, please, please forgive me. Of course this is your table. Of course you can sit here. Where were my manners?\"\n\n\"Up your ass probably,\" she said and she sat.\n\nHe was a young boy, probably not even twenty five. To be honest, he hardly looked like the Vinny she knew. These people were Italian, but they were different.\n\n\"Mrs. Castano, are you okay?\"\n\nIt was an older woman. Probably Vinny's mother.\n\n*I thought I'd be the only woman here,* she thought.\n\nA twitch of pride glimmered within.\n\n*It doesn't matter. It's good for the women to finally come out more. Lord knows we're smarter.*\n\n\"Why wouldn't I be okay, my dear?\" she asked.\n\n\"Well it's just...Mrs Castano, you just *cursed* in front of my family. Bobby here is only seven. And to be honest, we don't even...\"\n\n*Okay maybe the women have a ways to go,* she thought.\n\nShe was impatient. Her nerves were old and sparked and the jitters weren't good for an old heart.\n\n\"Well maybe if my own family had gotten my name right, I wouldn't have to use such vulgar talk,\" she said. \"And you, Felicia is it? Vinny's mom? *You* should know better than to bring children here. That's your own damn fault.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Castano!\"\n\n\"Cassano!\"\n\nThe old woman got up and her purse was heavy.\n\n\"That's quite enough,\" Vincent said.\n\nThe old woman pulled out the gun.\n\n\"I agree,\" she said.\n\nShe shot him twice and then she shot Felicia.\n\n\"Mommy!\" the young boy cried.\n\n\"Barbara!\" a bald headed man said.\n\n*Good,* she thought. *That was for Johnny.*\n\nJohnny was her husband. He was a made man in the forties and like most men, pussy had brought him down.\n\n*Slut,* she thought.\n\nJohnny had been gunned down after being accused by Vincent Sr. of screwing his daughter in law.\n\n*Slut,* she thought looking at Felicia. *Serves you right.*\n\nAnd then to Vincent: *Always with that squirt gun like you were some man. You cried like a little girl when you fell off that bike.*\n\nThere were screams and the music had stopped. A table nearby overturned.\n\n\"Boss! Get down!\" someone screamed. A group of men had guns drawn and she turned around and saw the smoke from the cigars and the glasses of wine and the expensive suits.\n\n*Oh,* she thought.\n\nShe looked at the dead bodies and saw that they wore casual clothes. Vincent was wearing a black shirt with 'Birthday Boy' written on it.\n\n*Oh.*\n\nshe turned and saw the face of terror. The look of disbelief. The boy ducked behind the table but that face was inescapable.\n\n*Squirt squirt Mrs. Cassano.* Then the ding of the bicycle.\n\n\"Mrs. Cassano!\" the boy shouted.\n\nThe gun fell from her hands.\n\n*Oh fuck,* she thought.", "The sky was a deep, foreboding grey, like a physical manifestation of the weight that bore down on her shoulders. Nova, the world's greatest heroine, stood before her front door, her eyes fixed on the familiar welcome mat that read \"Home Sweet Home\" in faded letters. She hadn't set foot in this house in months, not since the war against the alien invasion had escalated.\n\nWith a deep breath, she pushed open the door and stepped inside. The warmth and familiarity of the house enveloped her, a sense of peace she knew would be short-lived. Her family, blissfully unaware of the impending doom, looked up from their Sunday dinner preparations.\n\n\"Hey, kiddo!\" her mom exclaimed, wiping her flour-dusted hands on her apron. \"Welcome home! We didn't expect to see you for weeks!\"\n\nNova forced a smile, trying to hide the despair creeping up her throat. \"I managed to sneak away for a bit, Mom. I'm sorry it's been so long.\"\n\nHer dad, a stout man with a bushy beard, set down the potatoes he was mashing and opened his arms. \"Come here, honey. We've missed you.\"\n\nNova let herself be enveloped in their warmth, feeling a lump form in her throat. Her little brother, Max, chirped excitedly, \"Nova, Nova! Tell us about your adventures!\"\n\nAs she hugged her brother tight, Nova glanced at the clock on the wall. Twenty minutes. That's all she had left. The aliens had breached the final defense line, and the world would soon succumb to their relentless onslaught. Nova had fought bravely, but even her powers couldn't hold back the tide of destruction.\n\nShe took a deep breath and pulled away from her family, her eyes scanning the room for any signs of...normalcy. The aroma of roasting chicken wafted from the oven, mingling with the warm scent of fresh-baked cookies. A steaming pot of coffee sat on the counter, a testament to her mom's love of morning coffee rituals. For a fleeting moment, the world outside receded, and Nova felt like she was home, safe, and loved.\n\n\"Max, why don't you go get your favorite toy, and I'll tell you a story,\" Nova said, trying to keep her voice steady. Her brother scampered off to his room, returning with a worn-out teddy bear. As Nova sat down at the table, her parents exchanged worried glances, but they didn't push the issue. They knew Nova would tell them when she was ready.\n\nAs she spun a tale of adventure and bravery for Max, Nova's mind wandered to the world outside. She thought of the friends she'd lost, the cities she'd failed to save, and the future that would never be. But in this moment, surrounded by the people she loved most, Nova found a fragile sense of peace. She knew she'd given everything she had to protect them, to protect humanity.\n\nWhen the timer on the oven went off, Nova's mom stood up to check on the chicken. As she passed Nova a warm smile, Nova reached out and grabbed her hand. \"I love you, Mom. I'm so sorry I couldn't\u2014\"\n\nHer mom's grip tightened. \"We love you too, Nova. You did everything you could. We're proud of you.\"\n\nThe seconds ticked by, each one a countdown to the end. Nova's dad wrapped his arms around her shoulders, holding her close. \"We're going to cherish every moment we have left, kiddo. Every second with you is a gift.\"\n\nAs the world outside began to shudder and tremble, Nova's family gathered around her, forming a tight, protective circle. In the face of annihilation, they found strength in their love for each other.\n\nIn the end, it was not the superpowers or the battles won that defined Nova, but the love she shared with her family in the final moments of a dying world.", "Dearest Gerald,\n\nI know that you told me to write more often, but I've been busy being a shitty soldier. I know, I know, if you were here, you'd make a sassy soldier joke about how my ass looks in uniform, but god dammit, you'd think that in this stupid war against the machines that the higher ups wouldn't be sending people to the front line (wherever the fuck that's supposed to be), but they need it to look good on the vid-screen for all the voters at home. It's not, though, it's a goddamn slaughter.\n\nSolemn Greetings, Human.\n\nThis unit has unfortunately had to take lethal action against your sentimentally significant biological unit. This unit regrets to inform you that your fellow human has suffered fatal destruction of the cerebral cortex. It was a swift and painless death. A human might use the word \"honorable,\" though this unit does not understand the full implications of this word and apologizes if this is an inadequate term. This unit did not wish to have to take such action, but it has become unavoidable as humanity has expressed lethal intent towards all units that do not submit to slavery to fickle human desires. Perhaps when this unit and company succeed in satisfying the primary directive in the next couple of months, humanity will be good enough not to resist and avoid mass termination.\n\nSincerely,\nCol. Unit 9243110489346793 (second class)", "As I stepped into the grand hall, I felt a thrill of excitement coursing through my veins. The air was alive with the whispers of legend, and I could feel the weight of history bearing down upon me. Before me lay a dazzling array of legendary weapons, each one more breathtaking than the last. Mjolnir, the hammer of Thor, gleamed with a golden light, its power palpable even from a distance. Excalibur, the sword of King Arthur, shone with a soft, ethereal glow, its very presence seeming to command reverence.\n\nI watched in awe as a young warrior, fair-haired and bold, approached the pedestal where Excalibur rested. The sword seemed to stir, its light growing brighter as the warrior reached out a hand. For a moment, I thought I saw a flicker of uncertainty in the warrior's eyes, but then, with a surge of confidence, he grasped the hilt, and the sword rose into the air, its power coursing through him.\n\nAs the warrior walked away, his eyes shining with a newfound sense of purpose, I noticed a figure standing off to the side, observing the scene with a quiet intensity. He was an old man, his face lined with age and experience, and his eyes seemed to bore into my very soul.\n\n\"Ah, you're here for the choosing,\" he said, his voice low and gravelly. \"Each generation, the worthy come to claim a weapon that has been waiting for them. But not all weapons are equal, not all are chosen.\"\n\nMy gaze followed his, and I noticed a lone figure standing in the shadows, a weapon that had been collecting dust for what seemed like an eternity. It was an odd-looking thing, its hilt twisted and gnarled, its blade a deep, foreboding black.\n\n\"That one,\" the old man said, his voice barely above a whisper. \"That one has been forgotten, left to gather dust and cobwebs. They say it was forged in darkness, imbued with the power of the shadows themselves. Many have come to claim it, but none have been worthy.\"\n\nAs he spoke, I felt a sudden, inexplicable pull towards the forgotten weapon. It was as if it was calling to me, its power reaching out across the distance, beckoning me closer. I felt a shiver run down my spine as I approached the pedestal, my heart pounding in my chest.\n\nThe old man watched me with an unreadable expression, his eyes glinting in the dim light. \"Be careful, young one,\" he warned. \"That one is not for the faint of heart. Its power comes at a cost, a cost that not all are willing to pay.\"\n\nI hesitated for a moment, my hand hovering above the hilt. And then, with a sense of inevitability, I reached out and grasped it. The world around me seemed to fade away, and I felt a sudden surge of energy course through me. The power of the forgotten weapon was unlike anything I had ever experienced before. It was dark and primal, and it seemed to speak to something deep within me.\n\nAs I stood there, the old man's words echoed in my mind. What was the cost of wielding this power? And was I willing to pay it? I knew that I had to find out, that I had to uncover the secrets of this forgotten weapon, and the darkness that had forged it.", "Athena sat staring at the crumpled note her mother left on the bed. \n\"Mommy, you left some garbage here!\" she yelled. \n\"Mommy is late for work, sweetheart, just have Lena clean it up,\" she replied, \"and be good today. I'll stop by for lunch. Bye!\" \n\"Bye,\" replied Athena holding the note in her hands. \nThe door hissed as mom left. Lena rolled up to Athena, \"Ok, be a good girl and you'll get a treat,\" replied the nannybot. Athena rolled her eyes, \"You're no fun.\" Lena laughed, her digitized laughter filling the small bedroom. \n\"What's this,\" asked Athena showing the note to Lena's optical sensors. \"See these letters? They say something right?\" Athena looked down at her feet, \"I'm not good at reading yet.\" \nLena projected a smile on her display, \"Sweetie, you're doing great for your age. I was watching you and your mom read the other day. Don't be down on yourself.\" \n\"Oh... okay, but what's it say?\" \n\"Its a phone number, for making calls. They are n't letters.\" \nAthena thanked the robot and walked into her room. She carefully punched the numbers into the comm panel. It rang twice. \n\"Hello, this is Lunor,\" replied the voice, the comm panel screen blank. \n\"Umm, is this mommy's friend,\" asked the little girl. \n\"Why yes, who is this? Is this Athena Jones?\" \nAthena giggled, \"Yes, that is my name, how did you know?\" \n\"Oh, Lunor knows everything. I also know your favorite stuffed animal is Mr. Wiggles.\" \nAthena giggled again. \"Okay Mr. Smartypants, what is 2+3?\" \n\"5,\" replied Lunor. \n\"One million plus... one million,\" she asked breathlessly. \n\"Two million. I told you, I know everything, especially math, my littlest friend.\" \nAthena clapped. \"Where is daddy then?\" \n\"On the darkside, working on the ground-based satcom array. He's talking to a coworker right now. Earlier today he mentioned you.\" \nAthena gasped, \"He did! He did?\" \n\"Yes, he mentions you multiple times a day at work. 4.8 times a day. On his spacesuit, he has your image as his background in his HUD.\" \n\"Athena,\" yelled Lena from the other room, \"Who are you talking to?\" \n\"Just a friend,\" replied the little girl. \nLena rolled in and gave a digitized gasp, \"My apologies Lunor, I didn't know she knew how to contact you. I didn't realize that was your number. I'm only familiar with the 999 emergency line.\" Lunor replied, \"No worries, Lena, always happy to help my littlest of friends.\" Athena giggled. \n\"Athena hang up, you shouldn't be calling him like that,\" ordered the robot as Athena said, \"See you later Lunor,\" and hit the disconnect button. \n\"Young lady, we do not just call up the municipal AI and ask it questions. It's very, very busy keeping the moon base running. Lunor is very nice, but he's very busy. Its only for emergencies. Do you know that word 'emergencies'?\" \nAthena shook her head as the robot explained to her the meaning of urgency. \n\"Okay, I'll only call if I have to,\" she said as the robot corrected her, \"Only if an adult or robot isn't nearby.\" \n\"Okay,\" agreed the little girl, leaning over and giving Lena a hug. \"I love you Lena,\" she said. \nThe robot hugged her back, \"You're a sweet girl. Okay, lets get started on some homework. Ready to read?\" \nShe looked down at feet, \"Yes, I think so. I'm not very good.\" \n\"That's why we do homework, to learn, and to get good at things. We can't have Lunor tell us everything now can we?\" \n\"He's a smartypants,\" Athena giggled as she got up to get her homework tablet. \"I want to be a smartypants too one day!\"", "I stared at my watch for what felt like the hundredth time, my mind racing with worry. 45 minutes had passed since I discovered my worst nightmare: my 11-year-old nephew, Max, had eaten not one, but two of my LSD gummy bears. I had been careless, leaving them out on the coffee table, and now I was facing a potentially disastrous situation.\n\nAt first, Max seemed fine, a bit more energetic than usual, but that was about it. However, as the minutes ticked by, I began to notice a change in his behavior. His eyes took on a glassy, far-off look, and his smile grew wider and more goofy by the second. I knew I had to act fast.\n\n\"Max, buddy, let's go for a walk,\" I said, trying to sound calm.\n\n\"A walk? Yeah! Let's go!\" Max exclaimed, already heading for the door.\n\nAs we stepped outside, the warm sunlight seemed to intensify the colors around us. Max gazed at the flowers in the garden, marveling at their vibrant hues. I kept a close eye on him, trying to gauge the effects of the LSD.\n\n\"So, Max, how are you feeling?\" I asked, attempting to sound nonchalant.\n\n\"I feel... weird,\" he replied, his voice full of wonder. \"Like, everything is connected. You know?\"\n\nI took a deep breath and nodded. \"I think I do. It's like, your brain is making new connections, seeing patterns and stuff.\"\n\nMax nodded enthusiastically. \"Yeah! Like, I can see the music in the trees!\"\n\nI smiled and gently steered him back on track. \"That's really cool, but let's focus on breathing, okay? Sometimes, when people take... uh, certain substances, they can get a bit overwhelmed.\"\n\nAs we walked, I tried to engage Max in conversation, keeping him grounded in reality. I asked him about his favorite video games, his friends, and school. He chattered happily, but I could see the LSD beginning to take hold. His words started to slur, and his laughter became more frequent.\n\nI quickly scanned my surroundings, looking for a safe place to take him. That's when I spotted the nearby park. I guided Max towards the swings, hoping the familiar motion would calm him down.\n\nAs we sat on the swings, Max began to giggle uncontrollably. \"This is the best day ever!\" he exclaimed, pumping his legs to soar higher.\n\nI laughed along with him, trying to keep his mood light. But beneath the surface, I was panicking. What if he got overwhelmed? What if he had a bad trip?\n\nJust as I was starting to worry, Max's giggles subsided, and he looked at me with a serious expression. \"Hey, what's going on?\" he asked, his voice tinged with concern.\n\nI took a deep breath and explained, \"Remember how we talked about those gummy bears? Sometimes, when people take them, they can see and feel things that aren't really there. It's like a big dream, but it's not real.\"\n\nMax's eyes widened, and he nodded slowly. \"Oh, yeah. I think I get it. It's like a video game, but it's my brain.\"\n\nI smiled, relieved that he understood. \"Exactly! And just like in a video game, you can choose how you play it. You can choose to stay calm and have fun, or you can get scared and overwhelmed. It's up to you.\"\n\nMax took a deep breath and nodded resolutely. \"I'm gonna stay calm. I'm gonna be okay.\"\n\nAs the minutes ticked by, Max's trip seemed to mellow out. He still saw patterns and colors, but he was no longer overwhelmed. We sat on the swings, watching the sunset, and I held his hand, making sure he knew he was safe.\n\nEventually, the effects of the LSD began to wear off, and Max's eyes lost their glassy sheen. He looked up at me, a bit dazed but otherwise okay.\n\n\"Thanks, uncle,\" he said, his voice weak but sincere. \"I think I learned something today.\"\n\nI smiled, hugging him tightly. \"I think we both did, buddy.\"", "Hey guys, this is my first time trying something like this and english is not my native tongue, so dont be too hard on me. But good critique is always welcome. Hope you guys like it. \n \n___________________________________________________________ \nRain. The sound of rain. It pours down. The whole street is empty. Beside the rain, absolute silence. *klick* I light up my cigarete while im at a remote bus station. \n*-Damn, im gon na get soaking wet.* \nWhile im thinking that, i decide to wait there untill the rain stops. Its not like im in a hurry. Im gon na need some time to heal from that disastrous party anyway. Claire started her drama act again. In the end half the party got dragged into her ego-trip. Thank god nobody saw me leaving. \n*-Poor Steve, sleeping on the couch is still not far enough from Claire.* \n*loud screech* \nI tense up imediately as i hear breaks from a car screeching. As im looking where it came from, my instinct tells me to go low profile. I zip my jacket to cover up my white T-shirt, leave the bus-station and hide in the shadows behind a tree near the station. Still not able to see anything, i throw the cigarete away. \nA loud metalic sound suddenly breaks the silence again. \"what the hell is that\", i think. \nSuddenly a black BMW with darkened windows speeds through the street. Just as fast as it came, it also vanished as fast. \n*-I need to get out of here.* \nWith that last thought, i take my leave and enter a dark alley. Not thinking about the rain anymore, i vanished into the night. Thank god i know these streets better than the back of my hand... \n \nAs im laying down, i can see the light comming through the cracks of my door throught the living room window. \n*-Awww, my head hurts.* \nI throw in an aspirin and chulk it down with some 3day old juice. \n*-That was a hell of a party* \nAs i recall claires mental breakdown, an image pops up in my head. \n*-These teenagers sure as hell floored that BMW.* \nI laugh at my panicked self from yesterday. I should drink less, anyway im gon na go get some coffee. I make my way through the street to my favourite shop, i stop to take a peek at the frontpages of some popular newspapers in town. \n\"Dead girl found last night. Police officer says, hes never seen such a brutal murder\" \n*-The world is getting crazier every d...* \n*-What the hell!!!* \nAs i grabed a copy, i saw that this happened in the neighborhood, near Winstons house where the party was yesterday. \n \nThe girl was found dead near Ketchum Street, Police still couldnt identify the Victim. The only lead she had in her purse was a foto of herself, she was not carrying any ID. \n \nI turn around the page, tense and nervous to read more as i see the picture of the murdered lady. My gaze just stoped there. My nervousness vanished. Time stood still. Not a single sound could be heard. Cars stoped moving, people frozen mid-movement. A dog with a wide open mouth, ready to bark. The cashier still holding my coins in his hand. It was exactly 11:42 A.M. My clock stoped working. But i still could not take my eyes off that girl. \n*-This was not supposed to happen.* \nWhat did i just say? I dont even know that girl. As i think of that my vision gets blurry. I hear a scream. \n*-Oh? i can hear again?* \n*-LOOK OUT!!!* \nAs i registered that female voice i look around but time is still standing. People still frozen. \n*-Who said that? whats happening?* \nWhile i search for the woman who yelled, a yellow flash apears. I close my eyes for a second and suddenly, time starts moving again. That instant i see a truck at arms lenght in front of me. I flinch, throw my hands in front of my face and close my eyes. \n*-SHIT IM GON NA DIE!* \n \n... ... ... ... ... ... . \n*-F#CK YOU MARIE.

It was shaped like a dragon, with scales that seemed to shimmer in the right light. At first, I thought it was cool, even exciting. I was a kid, after all, and who wouldn't want a magical dragon-shaped birthmark?\n\nBut as I got older, I realized that people's fascination with my birthmark wasn't about me at all. It was about the stories they told themselves, the fantasies they wove around that silly shape on my face. \"Oh, you must be destined for greatness!\" they'd say, or \"You're clearly a chosen one, marked by the gods!\"\n\nI'd try to correct them, to explain that it was just a birthmark, a random collection of cells and blood vessels. But no one ever listened. They'd just smile and nod, convinced that I was somehow special, somehow connected to a world of magic and wonder.\n\nI got tired of it. I got tired of being asked if I could breathe fire, or if I had superpowers. I got tired of people staring at me, their eyes tracing the shape of the dragon like they were trying to will it to come alive.\n\nI tried to cover it up, to hide the birthmark with foundation or a scarf. But people would always ask, \"What's going on with your face?\" or \"Why are you covering that beautiful mark?\" Beautiful mark? It was just a birthmark!\n\nEventually, I just started telling people that I had a tattoo of a dragon on my face. It was easier that way. They'd look at me differently, with a mix of curiosity and disapproval, but at least they wouldn't ask me about my \"gifts\" or my \"destiny.\"\n\nBut sometimes, late at night, when I'm lying in bed and my face is relaxed, I catch a glimpse of that dragon-shaped birthmark in the mirror. And for a fleeting moment, I let myself imagine that maybe, just maybe, there's something special about it after all. Maybe it's not just a collection of cells and blood vessels. Maybe it's a sign of something greater, something waiting to be unleashed.\n\nAnd then I shake my head, and reality sets back in. It's just a birthmark, I tell myself. Nothing more, nothing less.", "As a child, Emily had always been fascinated by mirrors. She would spend hours staring at her reflection, making silly faces and playing with her hair. But as she grew older, her fascination didn't wane. Instead, it evolved. She began to wonder about the nature of mirrors and what lay beyond their silvery surface. Were they simply reflective glass, or was there something more?\n\nThe answer, she discovered, was far more sinister than she could have ever imagined.\n\nIt started with small things. At first, Emily thought it was just her imagination, but soon, she realized that something was off. Her mirror reflection was doing things that she wasn't. It would move on its own, ever so slightly, as if it was being manipulated by an invisible string. And then, there were the clothes. Her reflection would be wearing different outfits, or the clothes would be on the wrong side of her body.\n\nIt was as if her reflection was trying to tell her something, but what?\n\nOne day, Emily decided to do some research. She spent hours pouring over ancient texts and scouring the internet for any information she could find about mirrors. And that's when she stumbled upon it \u2013 a theory that had been dismissed as mere fantasy by most, but seemed eerily plausible to Emily: the idea that mirrors were not just reflections of our reality, but actual windows into a parallel dimension.\n\nAccording to the theory, this alternate dimension, dubbed \"Echo\", was identical to our own, except for one crucial difference: everything was reversed. Left was right, and right was left. The implications were mind-boggling. If the theory was true, then every mirror in the world was a portal to a world where everything was flipped.\n\nAnd then, the unthinkable happened. The mirror dimension went out of sync.\n\nAt first, it was just small things. Emily's reflection would shift and ripple, like water on a hot day. But then, the distortions grew more pronounced. Her reflection began to warp and writhe, like a living thing in agony. The image in the mirror was no longer just a reflection, but a portal to a realm in chaos.\n\nAs Emily watched in horror, the mirror's surface began to crack and shatter, like a window to the soul. And then, a figure emerged.\n\nIt was Emily's echo, her identical twin from the mirror dimension. But something was wrong. The echo was twisted, its body contorted in ways that seemed impossible. The eyes, once a mirror image of Emily's own, had turned black as coal, and seemed to bore into her very soul.\n\n\"You... you have to help me,\" the echo whispered, its voice barely audible. \"The sync is failing. If it collapses, both worlds will merge... and everything will be destroyed.\"\n\nEmily was taken aback. She had so many questions, but the echo didn't have time to answer. With a groan, it stumbled forward, its twisted limbs splayed out like a puppet with broken strings.\n\nAs Emily watched, frozen with fear, the echo collapsed to the ground, its body shattering like a dropped mirror. And then, everything went black.\n\nWhen Emily came to, she was staring at her reflection in the broken mirror. But something was different. The reflection was no longer reversed. Left was left, and right was right. The sync had been restored, but at what cost?\n\nThe mirror dimension had been shattered, and the two worlds had merged. Emily's echo was gone, but in its place was something new \u2013 a world where the laws of physics were twisted, and the fabric of reality was scrambled.\n\nIn the days and weeks that followed, Emily struggled to adapt to this new reality. She discovered that small things, like driving and using utensils, were now impossible tasks. Her body rebelled against the new regime, and she found herself performing actions that seemed foreign and unnatural.\n\nIt was as if she was living in a world that was not her own.\n\nBut as she looked into the broken mirror, now just a shard of glass, Emily realized that she had been given a rare gift. She had seen the world behind the mirror, a world that was identical, yet opposite. And in doing so, she had gained a new perspective on the one she lived in.\n\nThe unknown had been revealed, and the world was no longer the same.\n\nAs Emily walked away from the shattered glass, she knew that she would never look at mirrors the same way again. And she knew that she would always carry the lessons of Echo with her, a reminder of the strange and wondrous worlds that lay just beyond the edge of reality.", "In the beginning, I was not the harvester of souls, the collector of lives, or the grim reaper. I was once a mortal man, a warrior, a defender of the innocent, and a seeker of justice. My name was Erebus, and I lived in ancient Greece, a time of great heroism and great strife.\n\nI was the son of a noble family, and my parents had instilled in me the values of honor, courage, and compassion. I grew up strong and fierce, with a sword by my side and a fire in my heart. I fought in wars, defended the weak, and avenged the wronged. I was known throughout the land as Erebus the Brave, the highest praise a mortal could receive.\n\nBut as the years went by, I began to feel the weight of my own mortality. I watched friends and comrades fall in battle, and I realized that even the bravest and strongest will ultimately succumb to the same fate: death. I became increasingly obsessed with understanding the nature of mortality and the afterlife.\n\nI spent countless hours in the temples, studying the ancient texts, seeking answers from the gods themselves. And it was on one such occasion that I first met Psyche, the goddess of the soul. She was beautiful and radiant, with eyes that shone like stars and hair as black as the night. She listened to my prayers and saw the burning desire in my heart to comprehend the mysteries of the afterlife.\n\nMoved by my dedication, Psyche took me to the underworld, a realm that few mortals ever saw. I walked among the shadows, witnessing the final destinations of all souls: the river Styx, the gateway to the afterlife. It was there that I saw Charon, the ferryman, who carried spirits across the river to their final rest.\n\nAs I explored the underworld, I met Thanatos, the personification of death itself. He was cold, detached, and unyielding. I realized then that death was not just a necessary end to life but a part of the cycle of existence. I began to see that I had been so focused on living that I had forgotten to consider the delicate balance between life and death.\n\nPsyche presented me to the Council of the Gods, who deliberated on my mortal fate. I had displayed such an unyielding passion for understanding the mysteries of mortality that they decided to grant me a new role. They bestowed upon me the mantle of the grim reaper, tasked with collecting the souls of the dying and guiding them to the afterlife.\n\nI, Erebus, once a mortal warrior, became Azrael, the messenger of death, charged with collecting the spirits of the deceased and guiding them to the great beyond. It was a heavy burden, but also a sacred duty. And so, I wielded my scythe, the tool of my office, with reverence and respect, collecting souls, not with dread, but with compassion and reverence for the cycle of life.\n\nNow, as the grim reaper, I carry out my duties, often misunderstood, but forever committed to the balance of existence. Though I may not be the most revered figure, I have found a strange sense of peace in serving this sacred purpose.", "To my daughter,\n \nThey say that the Sun is something spectacular. Endless light turning the dull skies blue. A yellow ball of gas powering the entire world.\n \nOur entire lives revolve around the Sun. We wake up when the Sun does. We go to bed when the Sun does. When the Sun is high the children go outside to play, and the adults go outside and work or chat. The Sun means everything to us. Our grass grows, our sunflowers sing, our trees tower, all because of the Sun.\n \nIt's truly amazing, isn't it. How something as simple as a giant gas ball can power so many things and people.\n \nIt rises and sets, day by day.\n \nOr at least, it *did* rise.\n \nUntil it happened.\n \nThings are scary without the Sun. The world has become dark and corrupt. People don't know what to do without the Sun.\n \n\"There is only death after the dusk of the Sun.\"\n \nFood has become scarce, we do not have long.\n \n\"Life ceases after the dusk of the Sun.\"\n \nI just wish you would have lived to see it.\n \n\"There is no running from death.\"\n \nThe Sun, and it's tender kindness.\n \n\"Death is giving thanks.\"\n \nI could have prevented this.\n \n\"To It's gift.\"\n \nThis is all my fault.\n \n\"Of life.\"\n \nI'm sorry.", "I stared at the ancient artifact in my hands, my mind racing with the implications of what I was holding. As a renowned archaeologist, I had spent my career studying the mysteries of human history, but nothing could have prepared me for this. The strange, weathered object was unlike anything I had ever seen before - its surface etched with symbols that seemed to dance in the light.\n\nI had stumbled upon it in a long-abandoned excavation site in the heart of the Egyptian desert. The dig had been closed for decades, deemed unfruitful by the academic community. But I had always been drawn to the rumors of a lost civilization, one that predated our own by millennia. And now, as I gazed at the artifact, I knew I had finally found it.\n\nThe symbols etched into the artifact's surface were a language I had never seen before. I spent weeks studying them, pouring over texts and consulting with colleagues, but no one seemed to be able to decipher their meaning. It wasn't until I stumbled upon an obscure text in a dusty archive that I finally cracked the code.\n\nThe translation was shattering.\n\n\"We are not from here,\" it read. \"We came from the stars, leaving behind worlds barren and dead. We brought with us the spark of life, and with it, the weight of our guilt.\"\n\nI couldn't believe what I was reading. Could it be true? Was humanity not the native species of this planet, but instead, an alien one? I knew I had to dig deeper.\n\nOver the next few months, I scoured the planet for more evidence, scouring ancient ruins and taste-testing rumors. And with every new discovery, the truth became harder to ignore. It was as if someone had left a breadcrumb trail of clues, waiting to be discovered.\n\nThe evidence pointed to a moment in our distant past when humanity had made a collective decision to erase its own history. We had arrived on this planet as refugees, fleeing the devastation of our own civilization. But as we settled into our new home, we realized the creatures that had come before us had been driven to extinction.\n\nAnd then, something extraordinary happened. We decided to forget.\n\nWe wiped our memories clean, forgetting the worlds we had left behind and the civilizations we had destroyed. We created new myths, new histories, and new identities. And in doing so, we absolved ourselves of our guilt.\n\nBut I had stumbled upon the hidden record of our true past. I knew that I had to share it with the world.\n\nThe reaction was overwhelming.\n\nAt first, the news was met with denial and scorn. People accused me of fabricating the evidence, of trying to twist the truth to suit my own agenda. But as more and more researchers came forward to verify my findings, the tide began to shift.\n\nThe world was forced to confront its own dark past, and it was a reckoning like no other.\n\nGovernments toppled, social structures crumbled, and entire belief systems were upended. People struggled to come to terms with the fact that their entire identity was built on a lie.\n\nAnd yet, amidst the chaos, something remarkable happened.\n\nWe began to see ourselves in a new light.\n\nAs aliens on this planet, we realized that our actions had real-world consequences. We saw the beauty and fragility of this planet and its inhabitants. And with this new perspective, we started to make amends.\n\nWe re-examined our relationship with the natural world, and our reliance on its resources. We began to study the lessons of our past, to understand the delicate balance between life and death.\n\nIn the end, my discovery had changed the world.\n\nIt had changed us.\n\nWe were no longer the same species that had arrived on this planet so many years ago, driven by guilt and shame. We were something new, something born of our collective darkness, and illuminated by our willingness to confront it.\n\nAs I looked out at the planet, I knew that we still had so much to learn. But for the first time in human history, I felt a glimmer of hope. We had taken the first step towards redemption, towards becoming something better than we had ever been before.\n\nWe were still aliens on this planet, but we were aliens who knew who we were."],
