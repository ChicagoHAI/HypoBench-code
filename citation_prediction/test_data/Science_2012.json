        "abstract": "Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) systems provide bacteria and archaea with adaptive immunity against viruses and plasmids by using CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) to guide the silencing of invading nucleic acids. We show here that in a subset of these systems, the mature crRNA that is base-paired to trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) forms a two-RNA structure that directs the CRISPR-associated protein Cas9 to introduce double-stranded (ds) breaks in target DNA. At sites complementary to the crRNA-guide sequence, the Cas9 HNH nuclease domain cleaves the complementary strand, whereas the Cas9 RuvC-like domain cleaves the noncomplementary strand. The dual-tracrRNA:crRNA, when engineered as a single RNA chimera, also directs sequence-specific Cas9 dsDNA cleavage. Our study reveals a family of endonucleases that use dual-RNAs for site-specific DNA cleavage and highlights the potential to exploit the system for RNA-programmable genome editing.",

Devices made with these electrodes exhibit ultrahigh energy density values in different electrolytes while maintaining the high power density and excellent cycle stability of ECs. Moreover, these ECs maintain excellent electrochemical attributes under high mechanical stress and thus hold promise for high-power, flexible electronics.",

We identified distant gene targets for hundreds of variant-containing DHSs that may explain phenotype associations. Disease-associated variants systematically perturb transcription factor recognition sequences, frequently alter allelic chromatin states, and form regulatory networks. We also demonstrated tissue-selective enrichment of more weakly disease-associated variants within DHSs and the de novo identification of pathogenic cell types for Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, and an electrocardiogram trait, without prior knowledge of physiological mechanisms.

We identified over 500,000 single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), the majority of which were rare (86% with a minor allele frequency less than 0.5%), previously unknown (82%), and population-specific (82%). On average, 2.3% of the 13,595 SNVs each person carried were predicted to affect protein function of ~313 genes per genome, and ~95.7% of SNVs predicted to be functionally important were rare. This excess of rare functional variants is due to the combined effects of explosive, recent accelerated population growth and weak purifying selection. Furthermore, we show that large sample sizes will be required to associate rare variants with complex traits.",

To address the concern that the virus could acquire this ability under natural conditions, we genetically modified A/H5N1 virus by site-directed mutagenesis and subsequent serial passage in ferrets. The genetically modified A/H5N1 virus acquired mutations during passage in ferrets, ultimately becoming airborne transmissible in ferrets. None of the recipient ferrets died after airborne infection with the mutant A/H5N1 viruses. Four amino acid substitutions in the host receptor-binding protein hemagglutinin, and one in the polymerase complex protein basic polymerase 2, were consistently present in airborne-transmitted viruses. The transmissible viruses were sensitive to the antiviral drug oseltamivir and reacted well with antisera raised against H5 influenza vaccine strains. Thus, avian A/H5N1 influenza viruses can acquire the capacity for airborne transmission between mammals without recombination in an intermediate host and therefore constitute a risk for human pandemic influenza.",

Through biochemical fractionation and quantitative mass spectrometry, we identified a cGAMP synthase (cGAS), which belongs to the nucleotidyltransferase family. Overexpression of cGAS activated the transcription factor IRF3 and induced interferon-\u03b2 in a STING-dependent manner. Knockdown of cGAS inhibited IRF3 activation and interferon-\u03b2 induction by DNA transfection or DNA virus infection. cGAS bound to DNA in the cytoplasm and catalyzed cGAMP synthesis.

        "abstract": "The electron-hole pair created via photon absorption in organic photoconversion systems must overcome the Coulomb attraction to achieve long-range charge separation. We show that this process is facilitated through the formation of excited, delocalized band states. In our experiments on organic photovoltaic cells, these states were accessed for a short time (&lt;1ps) via IR optical excitation of electron-hole pairs bound at the heterojunction. Atomistic modelling showed that the IR photons promote bound charge pairs to delocalised band states, similar to those formed just after singlet exciton dissociation, which indicates that such states act as the gateway for charge separation. Our results suggest that charge separation in efficient organic photoconversion systems, occurs through hot-state charge delocalisation rather than energy-gradient-driven intermolecular hopping.",

We demonstrate that rapamycin disrupted a second mTOR complex, mTORC2, in vivo and that mTORC2 was required for the insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis. Further, decreased mTORC1 signaling was sufficient to extend life span independently from changes in glucose homeostasis, as female mice heterozygous for both mTOR and mLST8 exhibited decreased mTORC1 activity and extended life span but had normal glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity.

Isolating the role of building block shape for self-assembly provides insight into the ordering of molecules and the crystallization of colloids, nanoparticles, proteins, and viruses. We investigated 145 convex polyhedra whose assembly arises solely from their anisotropic shape. Our results demonstrate a remarkably high propensity for thermodynamic self-assembly and structural diversity. We show that from simple measures of particle shape and local order in the fluid, the assembly of a given shape into a liquid crystal, plastic crystal, or crystal can be predicted.",

In humans, we identified a polymorphism in the gene for Dectin-1 (CLEC7A) that is strongly linked to a severe form of ulcerative colitis. Together, our findings reveal a eukaryotic fungal community in the gut (the \"mycobiome\") that coexists with bacteria and substantially expands the repertoire of organisms interacting with the intestinal immune system to influence health and disease.",

We monitored the impact of miR-430 on ribosome occupancy of endogenous mRNAs in wild-type and dicer mutant zebrafish embryos and found that miR-430 reduces the number of ribosomes on target mRNAs before causing mRNA decay. Translational repression occurs before complete deadenylation, and disrupting deadenylation with use of an internal polyadenylate tail did not block target repression. Lastly, we observed that ribosome density along the length of the message remains constant, suggesting that translational repression occurs by reducing the rate of initiation rather than affecting elongation or causing ribosomal drop-off.

On deactivation, pore hydrophobic collapse rapidly halts ion flow. Subsequent voltage-sensing domain (VSD) relaxation, including inward, 15-angstrom S4-helix motion, completes the transition. On activation, outward S4 motion tightens the VSD-pore linker, perturbing linker-S6-helix packing. Fluctuations allow water, then potassium ions, to reenter the pore; linker-S6 repacking stabilizes the open pore.

Spectrin exhibited periodic structures alternating with those of actin and adducin, and the distance between adjacent actin-adducin rings was comparable to the length of a spectrin tetramer. Sodium channels in axons were distributed in a periodic pattern coordinated with the underlying actin-spectrin-based cytoskeleton.",

These amyloid fibrils were long suspected to be the disease agents, but evidence suggests that smaller, often transient and polymorphic oligomers are the toxic entities. Here, we identify a segment of the amyloid-forming protein \u03b1B crystallin, which forms an oligomeric complex exhibiting properties of other amyloid oligomers: \u03b2-sheet-rich structure, cytotoxicity, and recognition by an oligomer-specific antibody. The x-ray-derived atomic structure of the oligomer reveals a cylindrical barrel, formed from six antiparallel protein strands, that we term a cylindrin. The cylindrin structure is compatible with a sequence segment from the \u03b2-amyloid protein of Alzheimer's disease. Cylindrins offer models for the hitherto elusive structures of amyloid oligomers.",

Following an initial rapid evolution, the full distributions reveal the approach towards a thermal-like steady state characterized by an effective temperature that is independent from the initial equilibrium temperature of the system before the splitting process. We conjecture that this state can be described through a generalized Gibbs ensemble and associate it with pre-thermalization.",

We demonstrate that the small, noncomplexed fungal cellulases deconstruct cell walls using mechanisms that differ considerably from those of the larger, multienzyme complexes (cellulosomes). Furthermore, high-resolution measurement of the microfibrillar architecture of cell walls suggests that digestion is primarily facilitated by enabling enzyme access to the hydrophobic cellulose face.

An important example of this is the Lifshitz transition (Lifshitz IM (1960) Anomalies of electron characteristics of a metal in the high-pressure region, Sov Phys JETP 11: 1130-1135), where the transformation of the Fermi surface of a metal from a closed to an open geometry (due to e.g. external pressure) leads to a dramatic effect on the electron magneto-transport (Kosevich AM (2004) Topology and solid-state physics. Low Temp Phys 30: 97-118). Here, we present the optical equivalent of the Lifshitz transition in strongly anisotropic metamaterials. When one of the components of the dielectric permittivity tensor of such a composite changes sign, the corresponding iso-frequency surface transforms from an ellipsoid to a hyperboloid. Since the photonic density of states can be related to the volume enclosed by the iso-frequency surface, such a topological transition in a metamaterial leads to a dramatic change in the photonic density of states, with a resulting effect on every single physical parameter related to the metamaterial - from thermodynamic quantities such as its equilibrium electromagnetic energy to the nonlinear optical response to quantum-electrodynamic effects such as spontaneous emission. In the present paper, we demonstrate the modification of spontaneous light emission from quantum dots placed near the surface of the metamaterial undergoing the topological Lifshitz transition, and present the theoretical description of the effect.",

It affects not only the directly afflicted but also the people around them, their families, and their closest relations. It indiscriminately hits all strata of society, no matter one's intellectual background, age group, or economic situation. There are many cases of highly successful and widely admired individuals who have been struggling with depression for years. Unfortunately, for reasons we still do not fully understand, this condition has been on the rise over the past decades. Considering its impact on an individual's quality of life and subsequently on the economy and society in general, gaining an understanding of what causes depression and trying to develop effective therapies is of utmost importance. Hence, this year's Neuroscience Special Issue is devoted to different aspects of depression.\n\n![Figure][2] \n\nCREDIT: ISTOCKPHOTO.COM\n\nDuman and Aghajanian (p. [68][3]) review evidence from basic and clinical studies that stress and depression cause neuronal atrophy and decreased synaptic connections in cortical and limbic brain regions. Antidepressants can block or reverse these neuronal deficits, although typical antidepressants have limited efficacy; however, novel rapidly acting antidepressants produce a fast induction of synaptogenesis and quickly reverse synaptic deficits caused by chronic stress. Together, these findings support a synaptogenic hypothesis of depression and treatment response.\n\nNewly generated neurons are required for mood control and for the beneficial effects of antidepressants. Understanding adult neurogenesis may therefore provide a road map for the development of new treatments for depression. Introducing the concept of the neurogenic interactome, Eisch and Petrik (p. [72][4]) synthesize recent seminal findings relevant to neurogenesis, with special emphasis on the interchange between stress, depression, and cognition.\n\nDeveloping a suitable animal model is often an important step for understanding the basic mechanisms underlying a disease. Berton et al. (p. [75][5]) summarize the current models for mood disorders and attempt a prospective analysis of potential tests or tools that might be implemented to improve our repertoire of such models for depression. The problem of animal models is also touched on in an article on why mental illnesses are so hard to treat, part of a Mysteries of the Brain package in the News Focus section, starting on p. [30][6].\n\nHowever, not all is bleak. There are individuals who overcome difficult situations and show astonishing resilience in the face of adverse circumstances and other forms of acute or chronic traumatic stress. Studying them might provide us with clues about what can go right. Southwick and Charney (p. [79][7]) provide an overview of current ideas about why some people are more protected against stress and depression than others and how this knowledge may help us develop better treatments and successful prevention strategies.\n\nIn Science Signaling , Shah describes evidence that hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide\u2013gated channels may be therapeutic targets for the treatment of depression, and Anisman and Hayley describe how targeting inflammatory mediators may enhance the efficacy of conventional therapies for depression.\n\n [1]: http://www.sciencemag.org/site/special/depression/index.xhtml\n [2]: pending:yes\n [3]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.1222939\n [4]: /lookup/volpage/338/72?iss=6103\n [5]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.1222940\n [6]: /lookup/volpage/338/30-a?iss=6103\n [7]: /lookup/volpage/338/79?iss=6103",

TECHNOL. 10.1021/ES2040625 (2012)\n\nA fungal outbreak has been threatening the 15,000-year-old Paleolithic rock art found in Lascaux Cave, France, since 2001, when intrusive white mycelia growths were first discovered in the cave. Unfortunately, the situation only worsened after varying biocide and mechanical treatments that removed the white overgrowths but resulted in the appearance and spread of large black fungal stains on the walls. Martin-Sanchez et al. isolated the most abundant species of fungi growing in the black stains between 2008 and 2011, before and after biocide treatments, to determine how the community structure has changed over time. Clone libraries constructed from samples taken in 2008 showed that fungal communities were dominated by one species; however, after treatment, fungal diversity substantially increased. In 2010 and 2011, the communities were again different, with the new community dominated by, among others, closely related black yeasts in the family Herpotrichiellaceae. Thus, the biocide treatments were at least partially responsible for the new fungal outbreaks. Careful testing of treatment methods or limiting tourism activities near Lascaux and other cave paintings (see Saiz-Jimenez et al. , Policy Forum, 7 October 2011, p. 42) may hopefully prevent a similar fate for other caves.\n\nEnviron.

        "abstract": "Microbiology\nAntibiotic treatment may be thwarted by bacteria, not only because molecular mechanisms of resistance are acquired and selected, but also because persister cells withstand the onslaught by becoming dormant. We know persister-cell formation occurs as bacterial populations move from log to stationary-phase growth, but little else. Vega et al. have implicated the bacterial signalling molecule indole in the enhancement of persistence to various antibiotic treatments by monitoring the formation of persisters and their transcriptional responses to indole. Gene expression in the oxidative stress regulator and phage-shock pathways increased, but drug efflux systems did not, suggesting that molecular antibiotic resistance pathways were not being induced in these conditions. Knocking out these genes resulted in less persistence. Activation of these responses, via indole signalling induced by low-level antibiotic exposure or other stress, may thus prepare a proportion of the bacterial population for further unpredictable and potentially harmful events\u2014a form of \u201cbet hedging.\u201d\n\nNat.

To better understand the evolution of cotton, Palmer et al. shotgun sequenced 454 2000-year-old archaeological samples of cotton from Africa and South America. On the basis of their results and comparisons with genetic data from extant species, they assigned the African lineage to the species G. herbaceum and the South American lineages to the species G. barbadense . From these data, the authors show that G. barbadense shows overall genome stability with few changes in the placement and number of transposable elements over the past 2000 years. In contrast, G. herbaceum showed significant differences in transposable element composition over time. On the basis of these results, the authors postulate that the ancient G. herbaceum lineage is more like the ancestral form of one of the original species parents of G. hirsutum than that of the extant lineages. Furthermore, they suggest that cotton genome evolution is characterized by bursts of transposable element activity followed by genome stability.\n\nMol. Biol.

These historical traces reveal a decrease in genetic diversity as migratory distance from Addis Ababa increases. Ashraf and Galor present the hypothesis that genetic diversity has exerted a long-lasting effect on economic development\u2014which is quantified as population density in the precolonial era and as per-capita income for contemporary nations\u2014beyond the influences of geography, institutions, and culture. They posit that intermediate levels of heterozygosity allow for a productive balance between the social costs of high diversity and the creative benefits of higher variance in cognitive skills. They show that the optimal level of diversity was approximately 0.68 in 1500 CE, and that this increased to 0.72 (which is pretty much where the United States sits) in the year 2000, with the most homogeneous country, Bolivia, placed at 0.63 and the most diverse country, Ethiopia, at 0.77. Just how large an effect are we talking about? They estimate that genetic diversity accounts of 16% of the cross-country dispersion in per-capita income; put in another way, shifting the diversity of the United States higher or lower by one percentage point would decrease per-capita income by 1.9%.\n\nAm.

        "abstract": "Computational Biology in-article table of contents\n\nA discussion of computational biology has to start with a pioneer of the field, Alan Turing, especially in this centennial year of his birth. He introduced us to the digital computer and proposed that much biology could be described by mathematical equations\u2014the number of spirals in a sunflower is a Fibonacci number and pattern formation in animal skins can be described by a reaction diffusion model. Turing lacked the data and the computing power to substantiate his models. Today, the availability of vast quantities of new data, together with striking advances in computing power, is promising to give us new insights into the mechanisms of life. This special section, together with related content in Science Signaling and Science Careers, highlights recent advances and outstanding challenges.\n\nModels that simulate biological processes can be characterized both by their level of biological detail and by their mathematical complexity. Mogilner et al. (p. [175][1]) describe these different classes of computer models, using the example of cell polarity mechanisms to show that diverse models are required to fit different experimental studies in an iterative loop of modeling and experimentation. In a News Focus, Pennisi (p. [172][2]) illustrates this loop, describing how researchers have combined modeling and experimentation to understand how lizards, turtles, and other animals cope with heat stress and potentially global warming (videos of some of these models can be found at  ).\n\n![Figure][3] \n\nCREDIT: SEITA MIYAZAWA/OSAKA UNIVERSITY\n\nAdvances in sequencing technology have resulted in a barrage of genomic information. Zerbino et al. (p. [179][4]) review the development of computational methods and algorithms to efficiently analyze these data, from the initial genome reconstruction to their use in comparing individuals and organisms, reconstructing phylogenies, and tying genotype to phenotype. Munsky et al. (p. [183][5]) note that phenotypic variation can occur even in genetically identical cells. They discuss stochastic gene expression as the likely source of this variability and describe how the analysis of variability can give insight into the mechanisms of gene regulation. At the level of morphogenesis that so fascinated Turing, Morelli et al. (p. [187][6]) describe how a combination of theory and experiment is being used to investigate developmental processes. They describe how patterning can arise from molecular gradients, from coupled biological oscillations, or from mechanical deformations of cells and tissues. Underlying all of this analysis is computer code, and in a Policy Forum, Morin et al. (p. [159][7]) call for this code to be made widely available and suggest how this might be implemented.\n\nTuring not only sought mathematical rules that govern biology, as described in Perspectives by Hodges (p. [163][8]) and French (p. [164][9]); he also questioned whether there were fundamental differences between how machines and biological organisms compute. There is much more work to be done in exploring such questions, and we look forward to the many new insights that will be gained along the way.\n\n [1]: /lookup/volpage/336/175?iss=6078\n [2]: /lookup/volpage/336/172?iss=6078\n [3]: pending:yes\n [4]: /lookup/volpage/336/179?iss=6078\n [5]: /lookup/volpage/336/183?iss=6078\n [6]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.1215478\n [7]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.1218263\n [8]: /lookup/volpage/336/163?iss=6078\n [9]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.1218350",

The mechanism behind this association remains uncertain; however, one possibility is that decreased fitness and decreased competition of trees under heavier pressure from browsers could lead to greater opportunities for the coexistence of multiple tree species. If consumer diversity has indeed contributed to acacia diversity, the conservation and retention of large herbivores in the African landscape may ultimately be important to the persistence of a diverse tree community.\n\nJ.

However, responding to and planning for it requires extending global models to the local level, and assessing impacts on a variety of local resources, such as ecosystems or seasonal water supply, that may have a complex response to the main variables, such as temperature and precipitation. Many uncertainties are associated with such downscaling, regarding how to extend the models and how to assess the local variability in, for instance, precipitation in a future climate. However, approaches are increasingly being developed to consider and explore these uncertainties explicitly, as well as to incorporate ranges of future variability into planning both in the near term and for longer periods. Goderniaux et al. illustrate such an approach for assessing the future of groundwater resources in the Geer Basin in Belgium, an important local source of drinking water. In their approach, the authors use the relative change between two global and six regional models, rather than the absolute predicted climates, to build up a stochastic set of future records in key parameters affecting the hydrology of the basin. This allows a probabilistic assessment that can more explicitly represent uncertainties for managers. Overall, they suggest that the climate change signal may dominate normal variability by the later part of this century. Mean groundwater levels are projected to decrease by about 10 m.\n\nWater Resources Res. 47 , W12516 (2011).",

(1 OCTOBER 2012) \u00a9 2012 AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY\n\nTraditional strain gauges use a patterned metallic foil, in which the change in shape on deformation translates into a change in electrical conductivity. These devices typically have a gauge factor of 2 to 5; thus, for measuring smaller deformations, silicon gauges are used, which have a gauge factor closer to 100 but are more sensitive to temperature changes and mechanical deformation. Hempel et al. have developed a scalable deposition method for making strain gauges based on graphene, in which the sensitivity of the device can be tuned by varying the deposition conditions. Solutions containing graphene flakes were spray-coated onto a substrate to make a percolating network as the active part of the sensor. Thicker films had less electrical resistance but lower transparency, and it was shown that the gauge factor could be correlated to the initial resistance of the films. Unlike metal gauges, in which the metal itself deforms during strain, in these sensors the graphene flakes don't deform. Rather, the layers slide past each other, and it is the reduction in flake overlap that changes the electrical conductivity. Gauge factors between 10 and 150 were demonstrated, but in theory much higher values could be obtained. In addition, the sensors can be deposited onto existing surfaces, including curved ones such as light bulbs.\n\nNano Lett. 10.1021/nl302959a (2012).\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

Finkelstein et al. report on the 1-year outcomes after the state of Oregon enrolled roughly 10,000 uninsured adults, selected by lottery and with annual incomes of $10,000 or less, in Medicaid. They find, in comparison to those who were not selected, a 15 to 35% greater consumption of health care, as measured by the number of hospital admissions, prescription drugs taken, and outpatient visits, along with a 15 to 60% greater rate of compliance with preventive care, such as testing for blood cholesterol and mammograms. The increased use of medical services was consistent with the observation that the incidence of diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and depression in the people who were eligible for Medicaid but did not win the lottery was twice as high as in the general adult population. Objective measures of changes in physical health await in-person follow-up assessments, but one remarkable finding from the surveys is that the impact of health insurance on subjective well-being, at least in this context, is equivalent to what would be produced by a doubling of one's income.\n\nQ.

There are uncertainties in climate models themselves and also in the models of species' response to climate change. To address this problem, Cheaib et al. compared the predictions of eight different species' response models for five dominant tree species in the flora of France, representative of the range of forest communities from Mediterranean in the south to more temperate in the north. For the two evergreen species considered, there was generally good agreement between models. Holm oak, the dominant Mediterranean species, substantially increases its range under all model scenarios; the range of Scots pine, a species of cooler and mountainous regions, was predicted to contract under most models. However, models agreed relatively poorly in their predictions of range shifts of three temperate broad-leaved deciduous species. A principal source of uncertainty is the current limits to understanding the effects of increasing CO2 concentrations on the physiology of these species. Such comparisons not only help foresters and conservation managers judge the probability of success (or otherwise) of management alternatives, but also help to focus future research on the areas of greatest uncertainty\n\nEcol.

Peter et al. examined theoretical models to determine parameters that distinguish between SDN and SSV. Identifying the origin of the genetic variant was dependent on the strength of selection and the frequency of the variant under selection. Examining genes previously identified to be under selection, but not yet fixed within humans, revealed that both models were applicable; save for the gene that encodes glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which appears to be under balancing selection and, because of the lack of a selective sweep, did not fit either model. Furthermore, when regions currently not under selection were examined, it was not possible to discriminate between selected and neutral variants. These results support the notion that the origin of human genetic variation that is subject to selection is complex and that an understanding of both standing variation and the de novo mutation rate is important to trace our evolution.\n\nPLoS Genet. 8 , 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003011 (2012).",

When Notch proteins are bound by their ligands, which are themselves transmembrane proteins found on adjacent cells, endocytosis of the Notch extracellular domain into the ligand-bearing cell occurs, during which the Notch protein is cleaved, allowing the intracellular domain to be translocated to the nucleus, where it activates target genes. Stephenson and Avis used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to physically stretch a portion of the receptor called the Notch negative regulatory region, which contains the masked site of proteolysis. They could show through AFM measurements and molecular dynamics simulations that such a mechanical stimulus unfolded the protein to expose a site where protolytic cleavage occurred (and actually monitored the latter as release of the AFM tip). The events and forces measured were consistent with a favored model of Notch signaling in which forces of ligand endocytosis expose the otherwise buried cleavage site, leading to slicing of the receptor and initiation of signaling.\n\nProc.

Ross et al. have used a survey of roughly 500 liberal and conservative Christians to examine the converse proposition\u2014that an individual's political views affect that person's religious beliefs. What they found was that self-described liberals and conservatives exhibited the expected views regarding higher tax rates and gay marriage. What was intriguing, however, were the views that both liberals and conservatives imputed to a contemporary Jesus: Conservatives rated Jesus as being more in favor of higher taxes on the wealthy and more opposed to gay marriage than they themselves were, with an opposite pattern for liberals. By placing more weight on issues on which they projected Jesus as being more extreme than themselves, individuals on both sides of the spectrum were able to reduce dissonance, which might be better characterized as social rather than cognitive, owing to the collective nature of religion.\n\nProc.

Over the past several years, successive experimental and theoretical studies have sought to clarify the extent to which the Polanyi Rules apply (or fail to apply) to such systems.

Especially useful in today's computer industry is the so-called exchange bias, a somewhat counterintuitive phenomenon whereby an antiferromagnet (AFM) interfaced with a ferromagnet (FM) biases the preferred direction of the magnetization of the FM despite having zero net magnetization of its own. Gibert et al. now demonstrate the exchange bias effect in an artificial lattice consisting of alternating thin layers of the normally nonmagnetic LaNiO3 and the magnetic LaMnO3. When sliced thinly, LaMnO3 is a FM, and the authors show that its magnetization curve is shifted by the presence of LaNiO3, as is typical in exchange bias systems; this suggests that LaNiO3 develops magnetic ordering as well. Previous work has indicated the presence of AFM order in thin films of LaNiO3; the authors' numerical modeling suggests that a modulated spin distribution resembling a spin wave is created in the nickelate.\n\nNat.

A bulk TI can be doped until it becomes superconducting, while preserving its signature surface states. This approach led to the discovery of CuxBi2Se3, a possible TSC, but intrinsic inhomogeneities in that material made progress difficult. Now, Sasaki et al. observe a possible TSC state in Sn1-xInxTe by point-contact spectroscopy, which shows a signature peak in the density of states at the Fermi energy instead of the gap expected in an ordinary superconductor. Coupled with theoretical considerations, this result indicates that the material is an unconventional superconductor. The similarity in the band structure and the spin-orbit coupling strength in the two materials (CuxBi2Se3 and Sn1-xInxTe) suggests a more general approach in the search for topological superconductivity.\n\nPhys.

Apes had recently evolved, and as climate warmed, their range expanded greatly, across most of Eurasia, leading to further diversification. One view is that some of these Eurasian apes eventually recolonized Africa as climate later cooled, although the fossil record remains sparse from this period. Hamon et al. explored the climatic conditions that led to this period of warmth in the Miocene and particularly that were favorable for the expansion of subtropical forests that the apes depended on. Using a global climate model, they concluded that the range of forests would be greatest when atmospheric CO2 levels were between about 560 and 700 ppmv. The East Antarctica Ice Sheet, which is thought to have begun to form by the middle Miocene as the overall Cenozoic climate was cooling, but not uniformly, was about 25% of its modern extent. Both conditions are needed to increase precipitation in Europe at that time. Further decreases in atmospheric CO2 levels and the expansion of ice led to the reduction of forests later in the Miocene.\n\nGeology 10.1130/G32990.1 (2012).",

During osteoclast differentiation, cells can fuse with one another to create multinucleate cells. Oikawa et al. found that in osteoclastic cell cultures, a protein known to be involved in Src-induced cancer cell invadopodia production, Tks5, was also induced during osteoclastogenesis. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Tks5 by Src was required for the generation of circumferential podosomes in osteoclasts and for their fusion. Knockdown of Tks5 in osteoclasts interfered with circumferential podosome formation and cell\u2013cell fusion, whereas polarized membrane extensions seemed to be unaffected.

One is to separate the components of a chemical reaction so that the electrons travel separately from the ions; this is the working principle of a battery and yields direct current (dc). The other method is to rotate a wire loop through a magnetic field, which generates alternating current (ac). For the most part, when the process is inverted to drive chemistry via electricity, a dc approach is the most straightforward to implement, because it essentially runs a battery in reverse. However, ac-mediated chemistry can sometimes prove advantageous, as Lee et al. demonstrate in an exploratory small-scale electrolytic synthesis of phenol from benzene. The authors set up their cell so that benzene oxidation occurred at both the anode and the cathode, propelled in the former case by preliminary water oxidation and in the latter by oxygen reduction. Coupling vanadium oxide electrode catalysts with an indium-doped tin diphosphate solid electrolyte, they examined each half reaction in turn and found evidence for distinct mechanisms based on differences in temperature and potential dependences and Raman spectroscopic data.

One approach would be to express processing enzymes in the growing plant itself. However, to avoid damage to the growing plant, the enzymes need to be held at bay until the time comes to convert cell walls into soluble sugars. Shen et al. have tackled this challenge in maize, for which xylanase can be used to break down cell walls into fermentable carbohydrates. Expression of xylanase in the plant alleviates problems of enzyme production and access to substrates, but at the same time produces problems in damaging plant growth, for example, yielding shriveled seeds. The xylanase was brought under control by adding an intein, a self-splicing peptide from the bacterium Thermus thermophilus . Use of a thermostable xylanase meant that treatment of the plant material containing the hybrid protein with temperatures in the range of 60\u00b0 to 70\u00b0C resulted in removal of the inhibitory peptide and the generation of functional xylanase. With an optimized version of the hybrid xylanase-intein, transgenic plants showed normal development and normal seed set, and improved biomass conversion to glucose and xylose.\n\nNat.

Muyle et al. sequenced the transcriptome of S. latifolia and found that genes on the Y chromosome show significantly less gene expression than those from the X. Examination of sex-linked transcripts from male and female plants indicated that S. latifolia is in the process of evolving dosage compensation for the X chromosome because of the degeneration of the Y, analogous to that of many animals, including humans. Furthermore, given the evolutionary youthfulness of this system (<10 million years compared to 150 million years for mammals), these findings suggest that dosage compensation is a relatively early process in the evolution of sex chromosomes.\n\nPLoS Biol. 10 , e1001308 (2012).\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

As the planet warms, this may produce novel communities and interactions between species. This is because species do not exist in isolation but as parts of large communities of interacting species. Milazzo et al. now report one such example by studying two closely related species of wrasse (rainbow and ornate) in the Mediterranean Sea. Rather than shift their ranges, they found that the cool-water species of fish shifted to a less-preferred seagrass habitat and reduced its level of activity when the density of the warmer-water species within the same enclosure was high. Interestingly, these shifts were not seen at cooler water temperatures and were only observed at high water temperatures when the ratio of the warm-water to cool-water species was high. Thus, in this particular example, the cooler-water species make these changes only when faced with the dual injury of both warmer water and interspecific competition. Furthermore, as species individually begin to respond to their changing environments, unexpected interactions and impacts among species are likely to occur. As the climate changes, we should begin to expect the unexpected.\n\nJ. Anim. Ecol. 10.1111/j.1365-2656.2012.02034.x (2012).",

Temporal or spatial changes in gene expression or changes in gene expression level can compromise cell activity or even viability. Transcriptional activators interact with coactivators, which in turn communicate with the general transcription machinery or chromatin remodeling factors to effect changes in gene expression. Using NMR, Brzovic et al. have examined the structural basis for the binding of the transcriptional activator Gcn4 to the coactivator Mediator subunit Gall11/Med15 (Gal11) in yeast. Activation domains, which are generally rich in acidic residues, often bind diverse coactivators through multiple low-affinity interactions. In this study, the activation domain shows a disordered structure that morphs to a more stable alpha-helical structure upon binding to Gal11. The protein-protein interface is rather simple and consists of only hydrophobic interactions, which allows the activator and coactivator to bind in multiple orientations, forming a so-called \u201cfuzzy\u201d complex. Gcn4 can also interact with other unrelated coactivators using the same residues through a similar mechanism, suggesting that this mechanism may enable transcriptional activators to interact with multiple targets.\n\nMol.

In some of the separation applications of zeolites, such as removing hydrogen from hydrocarbon gas streams, both large and small molecules occupy the material's internal channels. In such processes, the larger molecules can partially block the channels and affect transport of the smaller molecules. Hedlund et al. measured the diffusion of helium in a ZSM-5 zeolite membrane in which they had adsorbed n -hexane or benzene. Loading with either hydrocarbon could decrease the transport by more than two orders of magnitude. Percolation models with parameters determined from density functional theory, rather than simply fitting the results with adjustable parameters, described the measured mass transport of helium through the defect-free zeolite. For n -hexane, the mass transport of helium initially decreased gradually with hydrocarbon loading but then decreased abruptly at about 50% loading. For benzene, the decrease was observed at a lower hydrocarbon loading (19%). This stronger effect was caused by benzene adsorbing at the intersections of channels in the zeolite.\n\nJ.

Males of this species were able to extract the eggs from females that expired as a result of these intense competitions among males. Field observations confirmed that males could manipulate dead females to extract oocytes and that these oocytes could be fertilized to produce embryos.

More usually it is the copepods that are the predators on algae, and their grazing reduces algal biomass and regulates bloom formation, but in this case the dinoflagellate Karlodinium armiger displays pronounced swarming behavior and forms feeding aggregates that allow the ingestion of prey much larger than itself.\n\n![Figure][1] \n\nCREDIT: TERJE BERGE AND NIELS DAUGBJERG\n\nISME J. 6 , 10.1038/ismej.2012.29 (2012).\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

Even if we control the clinical use of antibiotics, there is still a growing problem of resistance. Where is it coming from? Pruden et al. have made the enormous undertaking of identifying environmental sources of antibiotic resistance genes in one river system from pristine sources in the Rocky Mountains, flowing through not just an altitudinal gradient but also a gradient of human activity. The background signal was measured by the occurrence of the tet(W) (tetracycline resistance) gene, whereas the sul1 (sulphonamide resistance) gene was taken as a marker of anthropogenic contamination. The results unambiguously showed accumulation of the sul1 gene down the river basin, primarily contributed by upstream animal feeding operations, with a modest input from wastewater treatment.\n\nEnviron.

Centromeres are defined by the presence of nucleosomes that contain a special histone H3 variant, CenH3. Accumulating evidence suggests that CenH3-containing nucleosomes have an unusual structure: Rather than consisting of the highly conserved octamer of histone proteins, which wraps up \u223c147 bp of DNA, they may instead form tetramers, which wrap only half as much DNA.\n\nTo understand how widespread this unusual centromeric nucleosome conformation might be, Krassovsky et al. fine-map the positions of budding yeast centromeres, which consist of a single CenH3 (known as Cse4) nucleosome binding site on each chromosome. Cse4 binds a region of DNA that is 80 bp in length, consistent with a tetramer nucleosome conformation. The highly AT-rich DNA sequence at the centromere and two protein-binding sites that flank the centromere site probably exclude binding of the canonical octamer nucleosome and recruit and stabilize the binding of the Cse4 nucleosome. Cse4 nucleosomes that become misincorporated at noncentromere sites, on the other hand, form octamers and are found in regions of high nucleosome turnover, the latter observation hinting how such excess Cse4, which could impede the function of the centromere, might be purged from the genome.\n\nProc.

The bacterium then replicates within the modified host cell vacuole. The Dot/Icm system has a large repertoire of translocatable substrates, which appears to endow this pathogen with a wide host range, allowing it even to colonize mammalian macrophages. In a series of evolution experiments, Ensminger et al. discovered that when grown exclusively in mouse macrophages for several months, L. pneumophila improved its ability to replicate in this abnormal host cell to the extent that it failed to thrive when returned to amoebae.

With the development of organic electronics, debate has surrounded the question of whether such systems can be designed to control the energy transfer process. Blum et al. conducted a systematic study of the FRET process involving two molecules (an acceptor and donor) bridged by a DNA chain that precisely established the separation distance. They altered the local optical environment by placing the molecules in the vicinity of a mirror and controlling that separation. Their main finding is that although the rate of energy transfer between the molecules is independent of what is done to the optical environment, the efficiency of that energy transfer process is sensitive. Such nanophotonic control might find practical applications in designing better artificial molecular-based electronic energy-harvesting or lighting devices.\n\nPhys. Rev. Lett. 109 , 203601 (2012).",

X. campestris delivers a protein effector called XopN into plant cells that binds to other proteins, including the 14-3-3 protein in tomatoes, TFT1. 14-3-3 proteins serve variously as clamps, masks, and scaffolds to regulate and organize the functions of a wide variety of target proteins. Taylor et al. studied how the interaction of XopN with TFT1 modulated the plant's pathogen defense response. Silencing of the gene that encodes TFT1 demonstrated that it plays a protective role against bacterial infection and regulates four other pathogentriggered plant genes. TFT1 was able to keep the growth of XopN-deficient bacteria in check, but this effect was abrogated in the absence of TFT1.\n\nXopN binds to TFT1 through its C-terminal domain. XopN also binds to TARK1, a tomato atypical receptor kinase that plays a role in plant defense, through its N-terminal domain, and this binding interaction seems to help the XopN C-terminal domain hold on to TFT1. Through its two-domain binding system, the bacterial XopN effector sequesters the two plant-defense proteins. It is not clear yet just how TFT1 and TARK1 defend the plant normally, but what is clear is that when XopN grabs both of them together, the plant's defense collapses.\n\nPLoS Pathog. 8 , e1002768 (2012).\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

The influence of biotic factors and species interactions such as mutualism on distributions has received less attention.\n\nMoeller et al. examined how the strength of a mutualistic interaction varied across a species' range. The herbaceous plant Clarkia xantiana , which is endemic to California, is pollinated by a suite of insect species. A study over 4 years showed a consistent decline in the abundance of pollinators from the center to the edge of the plant's geographic range, and experimental manipulations of the plants confirmed that reproduction at the range limits was limited by pollen availability and was not compensated for by self-pollination. Although the ultimate cause may be climatic (the pollinators' abundance itself being influenced by precipitation), this study provides new insight into the multiple factors that control biogeographic patterns.\n\nEcology 93 , 1036 (2012).\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

SIDE was found to be advantageous over current commercial text analysis programs, because it required less time and financial investment.

One idea for capturing and storing CO2 is injecting it into the highly saline ground-waters that are common on many continents. These brines are often relics of earlier hydrologic systems and have persisted for millions to tens of millions of years (or longer) because their high salinity makes them denser than shallow freshwater systems. Using thermodynamic modelling of the system CO2-H2O-NaCl-CaCO3, Steele-MacInnis et al. explore what will happen to CO2 when injected as a supercritical fluid into deep saline formations, with a goal of estimating the available storage volume. Initially, injected CO2 will displace the brine, but over time, it will dissolve in the brine. Their thermodynamic analysis shows that this dissolution will yield the most favorable storage conditions and will markedly reduce storage volume requirements. It will also increase the density of the brine, stabilizing it further.\n\nEnviron. Sci. Technol. 10.1021/es301598t (2012).",

Associated genetic mutations impair function of the inner ear, where sensory cells fail to convert sound waves into electrical signals. Riazuddin et al. have determined that mutations in the gene CIB2 contribute to Usher syndrome and nonsyndromic deafness. CIB2 encodes calcium and integrin binding protein 2, which is widely expressed in human and mouse tissue. In the mouse inner ear, the protein localizes to the tips of stereocilia of inner ear cells. When deflected by sound waves, ion channels in these hairlike projections open, triggering a mechanoelectrical signaling cascade. CIB2 interacts with whirlin, a protein that organizes molecular complexes that maintain stereocilia structure and growth. Suppression of CIB2 expression in zebrafish disrupted responses to acoustic stimuli and caused abnormal balance during movement. Overexpression of CIB2 in cultured cells decreased the release of calcium from intracellular stores. CIB2 may help to maintain intracellular calcium homeostasis in inner ear cells by sequestering calcium and influencing the release of stored calcium during mechanoelectrical signal transduction.\n\nNat.
