        "title": "Comprehensive molecular profiling of lung adenocarcinoma",
        "abstract": "Adenocarcinoma of the lung is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Here we report molecular profiling of 230 resected lung adenocarcinomas using messenger RNA, microRNA and DNA sequencing integrated with copy number, methylation and proteomic analyses. High rates of somatic mutation were seen (mean 8.9 mutations per megabase). Eighteen genes were statistically significantly mutated, including RIT1 activating mutations and newly described loss-of-function MGA mutations which are mutually exclusive with focal MYC amplification. EGFR mutations were more frequent in female patients, whereas mutations in RBM10 were more common in males. Aberrations in NF1, MET, ERBB2 and RIT1 occurred in 13% of cases and were enriched in samples otherwise lacking an activated oncogene, suggesting a driver role for these events in certain tumours. DNA and mRNA sequence from the same tumour highlighted splicing alterations driven by somatic genomic changes, including exon 14 skipping in MET mRNA in 4% of cases. MAPK and PI(3)K pathway activity, when measured at the protein level, was explained by known mutations in only a fraction of cases, suggesting additional, unexplained mechanisms of pathway activation. These data establish a foundation for classification and further investigations of lung adenocarcinoma molecular pathogenesis. An integrated transcriptome, genome, methylome and proteome analysis of over 200 lung adenocarcinomas reveals high rates of somatic mutations, 18 statistically significantly mutated genes including RIT1 and MGA, splicing changes, and alterations in MAPK and PI(3)K pathway activity. This report from The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network presents molecular profiling of 230 resected untreated lung adenocarcinomas. Integrated analyses of transcriptome, genome, methylome and proteome collectively identify high rates of somatic mutation, significantly mutated genes including RIT1 and MGA, splicing alterations driven by somatic genomic changes, and point to as yet unidentified lesions that alter MAPK and PI(3)K pathway activity. These data establish a foundation for classification and further investigations of the leading cause of cancer death worldwide.",

        "title": "Comprehensive molecular characterization of gastric adenocarcinoma",
        "abstract": "Gastric cancer is a leading cause of cancer deaths, but analysis of its molecular and clinical characteristics has been complicated by histological and aetiological heterogeneity. Here we describe a comprehensive molecular evaluation of 295 primary gastric adenocarcinomas as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. We propose a molecular classification dividing gastric cancer into four subtypes: tumours positive for Epstein\u2013Barr virus, which display recurrent PIK3CA mutations, extreme DNA hypermethylation, and amplification of JAK2, CD274 (also known as PD-L1) and PDCD1LG2 (also known as PD-L2); microsatellite unstable tumours, which show elevated mutation rates, including mutations of genes encoding targetable oncogenic signalling proteins; genomically stable tumours, which are enriched for the diffuse histological variant and mutations of RHOA or fusions involving RHO-family GTPase-activating proteins; and tumours with chromosomal instability, which show marked aneuploidy and focal amplification of receptor tyrosine kinases. Identification of these subtypes provides a roadmap for patient stratification and trials of targeted therapies. The Cancer Genome Atlas reports on molecular evaluation of 295 primary gastric adenocarcinomas and proposes a new classification of gastric cancers into 4 subtypes, which should help with clinical assessment and trials of targeted therapies. This contribution from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project describes the molecular evaluation of 295 primary gastric adenocarcinomas. Based on the results, the authors propose a novel classification separating gastric cancers into four subtypes according to: Epstein\u2013Barr virus positive status, microsatellite instability, chromosomal instability or genomic stability. Given the histologic and etiologic heterogeneity of gastric cancer identification of these subtypes, using a schema that can readily be applied to patient samples should help with patient stratification and trials of targeted therapies.",

        "abstract": "This 6 November image may be the best ever taken of a protoplanetary disk, the dust and gas that swirl around a young star and seed new planets.The Sun-like star HL Tau, 138 parsecs (450 light years) from Earth, sits in the centre of an orange-coloured disk of gas and particles that have started to coalesce into clumps.These emerging planets accumulate material as they orbit the star, eventually clearing out the lanes in which they travel, which are seen as black rings.The image comes from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in Chile, whose 66 radio antennas are being ramped up to image celestial objects in unprecedented detail.Since September, the antennas have been positioned so that their data can be combined to produce the sharpest images yet.",

        "abstract": "North America is strides ahead of all other regions, including its nearest rival North and Western Europe, in producing high-quality science.Boasting a WFC of more than 20,000 in the Nature Index, its two constituent countries, Canada and the United States, have long enjoyed strong support for natural science, mostly from their research universities.But both are adapting to significant shifts in public funding in recent years.The United States, comfortably the global leader in the index, is weathering funding cuts that have curtailed many research agencies.Canada, which comes in seventh globally and has notable strengths in life sciences and earth and environmental sciences, is attempting to tie its research more tightly to commercial innovation.The United States dwarfs its northern neighbour on nearly every measure, but the index reveals more nuanced information about how it uses its resources.For example, according to UNESCO, there are 1.25 million researchers employed in the United States, which is 3,979 per million citizens; Canada has only 157,000 researchers, but this translates to 4,563 per million people -a higher density.The Nature Index, however, shows that the United States is better able to leverage its researchers, producing a WFC of 14.9 per thousand researchers compared to Canada's 9.4 (see 'Researcher efficiency').Researcher efficiency may be a factor in the relative lack of collaboration with countries outside the region, a metric that is lower than the global average across all subjects.The United States is relatively self-sufficient, particularly when it comes to papers in either Nature or Science (see 'Collaboration rate').",
