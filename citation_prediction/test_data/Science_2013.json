The type II prokaryotic CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas adaptive immune system has been shown to facilitate RNA-guided site-specific DNA cleavage. We engineered two different type II CRISPR/Cas systems and demonstrate that Cas9 nucleases can be directed by short RNAs to induce precise cleavage at endogenous genomic loci in human and mouse cells. Cas9 can also be converted into a nicking enzyme to facilitate homology-directed repair with minimal mutagenic activity. Lastly, multiple guide sequences can be encoded into a single CRISPR array to enable simultaneous editing of several sites within the mammalian genome, demonstrating easy programmability and wide applicability of the RNA-guided nuclease technology.",

        "abstract": "Bacteria and archaea have evolved adaptive immune defenses, termed clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) systems, that use short RNA to direct degradation of foreign nucleic acids. Here, we engineer the type II bacterial CRISPR system to function with custom guide RNA (gRNA) in human cells. For the endogenous AAVS1 locus, we obtained targeting rates of 10 to 25% in 293T cells, 13 to 8% in K562 cells, and 2 to 4% in induced pluripotent stem cells. We show that this process relies on CRISPR components; is sequence-specific; and, upon simultaneous introduction of multiple gRNAs, can effect multiplex editing of target loci. We also compute a genome-wide resource of ~190 K unique gRNAs targeting ~40.5% of human exons. Our results establish an RNA-guided editing tool for facile, robust, and multiplexable human genome engineering.",

We found that the diffusion lengths are greater than 1 micrometer in the mixed halide perovskite, which is an order of magnitude greater than the absorption depth. In contrast, the triiodide absorber has electron-hole diffusion lengths of ~100 nanometers.

By applying femtosecond transient optical spectroscopy to bilayers that interface this perovskite with either selective-electron or selective-hole extraction materials, we have uncovered concrete evidence of balanced long-range electron-hole diffusion lengths of at least 100 nanometers in solution-processed CH3NH3PbI3.

        "title": "Liquid Exfoliation of Layered Materials",
        "abstract": "Background Since at least 400 C.E., when the Mayans first used layered clays to make dyes, people have been harnessing the properties of layered materials. This gradually developed into scientific research, leading to the elucidation of the laminar structure of layered materials, detailed understanding of their properties, and eventually experiments to exfoliate or delaminate them into individual, atomically thin nanosheets. This culminated in the discovery of graphene, resulting in a new explosion of interest in two-dimensional materials. Layered materials consist of two-dimensional platelets weakly stacked to form three-dimensional structures. The archetypal example is graphite, which consists of stacked graphene monolayers. However, there are many others: from MoS 2 and layered clays to more exotic examples such as MoO 3 , GaTe, and Bi 2 Se 3 . These materials display a wide range of electronic, optical, mechanical, and electrochemical properties. Over the past decade, a number of methods have been developed to exfoliate layered materials in order to produce monolayer nanosheets. Such exfoliation creates extremely high-aspect-ratio nanosheets with enormous surface area, which are ideal for applications that require surface activity. More importantly, however, the two-dimensional confinement of electrons upon exfoliation leads to unprecedented optical and electrical properties. Advances An important advance has been the discovery that layered crystals can be exfoliated in liquids. There are a number of methods to do this that involve oxidation, ion intercalation/exchange, or surface passivation by solvents. However, all result in liquid dispersions containing large quantities of nanosheets. This brings considerable advantages: Liquid exfoliation allows the formation of thin films and composites, is potentially scaleable, and may facilitate processing by using standard technologies such as reel-to-reel manufacturing. Although much work has focused on liquid exfoliation of graphene, such processes have also been demonstrated for a host of other materials, including MoS 2 and related structures, layered oxides, and clays. The resultant liquid dispersions have been formed into films, hybrids, and composites for a range of applications. Outlook There is little doubt that the main advances are in the future. Multifunctional composites based on metal and polymer matrices will be developed that will result in enhanced mechanical, electrical, and barrier properties. Applications in energy generation and storage will abound, with layered materials appearing as electrodes or active elements in devices such as displays, solar cells, and batteries. Particularly important will be the use of MoS 2 for water splitting and metal oxides as hydrogen evolution catalysts. In addition, two-dimensional materials will find important roles in printed electronics as dielectrics, optoelectronic devices, and transistors. To achieve this, much needs to be done. Production rates need to be increased dramatically, the degree of exfoliation improved, and methods to control nanosheet properties developed. The range of layered materials that can be exfoliated must be expanded, even as methods for chemical modification must be developed. Success in these areas will lead to a family of materials that will dominate nanomaterials science in the 21st century.",

Increased total body and fat mass, as well as obesity-associated metabolic phenotypes, were transmissible with uncultured fecal communities and with their corresponding fecal bacterial culture collections. Cohousing mice harboring an obese twin's microbiota (Ob) with mice containing the lean co-twin's microbiota (Ln) prevented the development of increased body mass and obesity-associated metabolic phenotypes in Ob cage mates. Rescue correlated with invasion of specific members of Bacteroidetes from the Ln microbiota into Ob microbiota and was diet-dependent.

Here, we expand the range of such structures to photoactive ones by using semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs)/graphene stacks. Van Hove singularities in the electronic density of states of TMDC guarantees enhanced light-matter interactions, leading to enhanced photon absorption and electron-hole creation (which are collected in transparent graphene electrodes).

We used a library containing 73,000 sgRNAs to generate knockout collections and performed screens in two human cell lines. A screen for resistance to the nucleotide analog 6-thioguanine identified all expected members of the DNA mismatch repair pathway, whereas another for the DNA topoisomerase II (TOP2A) poison etoposide identified TOP2A, as expected, and also cyclin-dependent kinase 6, CDK6. A negative selection screen for essential genes identified numerous gene sets corresponding to fundamental processes. Last, we show that sgRNA efficiency is associated with specific sequence motifs, enabling the prediction of more effective sgRNAs.

In an index patient, reversible shifts between these cell fates accompanied each cycle of response to therapy and disease progression. Mesenchymal CTCs occurred as both single cells and multicellular clusters, expressing known EMT regulators, including transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 pathway components and the FOXC1 transcription factor.

Second, we examined the cognitive function of farmers over the planting cycle. We found that the same farmer shows diminished cognitive performance before harvest, when poor, as compared with after harvest, when rich. This cannot be explained by differences in time available, nutrition, or work effort. Nor can it be explained with stress: Although farmers do show more stress before harvest, that does not account for diminished cognitive performance. Instead, it appears that poverty itself reduces cognitive capacity. We suggest that this is because poverty-related concerns consume mental resources, leaving less for other tasks.

        "abstract": "Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is an inherited lysosomal storage disease caused by arylsulfatase A (ARSA) deficiency. Patients with MLD exhibit progressive motor and cognitive impairment and die within a few years of symptom onset. We used a lentiviral vector to transfer a functional ARSA gene into hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from three presymptomatic patients who showed genetic, biochemical, and neurophysiological evidence of late infantile MLD. After reinfusion of the gene-corrected HSCs, the patients showed extensive and stable ARSA gene replacement, which led to high enzyme expression throughout hematopoietic lineages and in cerebrospinal fluid. Analyses of vector integrations revealed no evidence of aberrant clonal behavior. The disease did not manifest or progress in the three patients 7 to 21 months beyond the predicted age of symptom onset. These findings indicate that extensive genetic engineering of human hematopoiesis can be achieved with lentiviral vectors and that this approach may offer therapeutic benefit for MLD patients.",

Although most OER catalysts are based on crystalline mixed-metal oxides, high activities can also be achieved with amorphous phases. Methods for producing amorphous materials, however, are not typically amenable to mixed-metal compositions. We demonstrate that a low-temperature process, photochemical metal-organic deposition, can produce amorphous (mixed) metal oxide films for OER catalysis. The films contain a homogeneous distribution of metals with compositions that can be accurately controlled. The catalytic properties of amorphous iron oxide prepared with this technique are superior to those of hematite, whereas the catalytic properties of a-Fe(100-y-z)Co(y)Ni(z)O(x) are comparable to those of noble metal oxide catalysts currently used in commercial electrolyzers.",

Earthquakes can be induced as part of the process to stimulate the production from tight shale formations, or by disposal of wastewater associated with stimulation and production.

        "abstract": "Introduction Despite the existence of institutions designed to promote peace, interactions between individuals and groups sometimes lead to conflict. Understanding the causes of such conflict is a major project in the social sciences, and researchers in anthropology, economics, geography, history, political science, psychology, and sociology have long debated the extent to which climatic changes are responsible. Recent advances and interest have prompted an explosion of quantitative studies on this question. Methods We carried out a comprehensive synthesis of the rapidly growing literature on climate and human conflict. We examined many types of human conflict, ranging from interpersonal violence and crime to intergroup violence and political instability and further to institutional breakdown and the collapse of civilizations. We focused on quantitative studies that can reliably infer causal associations between climate variables and conflict outcomes. The studies we examined are experiments or \u201cnatural experiments\u201d; the latter exploit variations in climate over time that are plausibly independent of other variables that also affect conflict. In many cases, we obtained original data from studies that did not meet this criterion and used a common statistical method to reanalyze these data. In total, we evaluated 60 primary studies that have examined 45 different conflict data sets. We collected findings across time periods spanning 10,000 BCE to the present and across all major world regions. Results Deviations from normal precipitation and mild temperatures systematically increase the risk of conflict, often substantially. This relationship is apparent across spatial scales ranging from a single building to the globe and at temporal scales ranging from an anomalous hour to an anomalous millennium. Our meta-analysis of studies that examine populations in the post-1950 era suggests that the magnitude of climate\u2019s influence on modern conflict is both substantial and highly statistically significant ( P &lt; 0.001). Each 1-SD change in climate toward warmer temperatures or more extreme rainfall increases the frequency of interpersonal violence by 4% and intergroup conflict by 14% (median estimates). Discussion We conclude that there is more agreement across studies regarding the influence of climate on human conflict than has been recognized previously. Given the large potential changes in precipitation and temperature regimes projected for the coming decades\u2014with locations throughout the inhabited world expected to warm by 2 to 4 SDs by 2050\u2014amplified rates of human conflict could represent a large and critical social impact of anthropogenic climate change in both low- and high-income countries.",

C9orf72 patients show two distinct types of ubiquitinated inclusions in the central nervous system, one of which was identified as phosphorylated TDP-43 protein. However, all inclusions in the cerebellum and most inclusions in the hippocampus and neocortex lack TDP-43, and the actual disease protein is unknown. Mori et al. (p. 1335 , published online 7 February; see the Perspective by Taylor ) discovered that most of these characteristic inclusions contain poly-(Gly-Ala) and, to a lesser extent, poly-(Gly-Pro) and poly-(Gly-Arg) dipeptide-repeat proteins that are generated by non-ATG\u2013initiated translation from the expanded GGGGCC repeats in three reading frames. The findings yield mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of FTLD/ALS with C9orf72 repeat expansions and directly link this common mutation to the characteristic pathology.",

        "abstract": "Kwashiorkor, an enigmatic form of severe acute malnutrition, is the consequence of inadequate nutrient intake plus additional environmental insults. To investigate the role of the gut microbiome, we studied 317 Malawian twin pairs during the first 3 years of life. During this time, half of the twin pairs remained well nourished, whereas 43% became discordant, and 7% manifested concordance for acute malnutrition. Both children in twin pairs discordant for kwashiorkor were treated with a peanut-based, ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF). Time-series metagenomic studies revealed that RUTF produced a transient maturation of metabolic functions in kwashiorkor gut microbiomes that regressed when administration of RUTF was stopped. Previously frozen fecal communities from several discordant pairs were each transplanted into gnotobiotic mice. The combination of Malawian diet and kwashiorkor microbiome produced marked weight loss in recipient mice, accompanied by perturbations in amino acid, carbohydrate, and intermediary metabolism that were only transiently ameliorated with RUTF. These findings implicate the gut microbiome as a causal factor in kwashiorkor.",

Transfer of gut microbiota from adult males to immature females altered the recipient's microbiota, resulting in elevated testosterone and metabolomic changes, reduced islet inflammation and autoantibody production, and robust T1D protection.

Advances Traditionally, dehydrogenation/oxidation reactions of organic compounds have been performed using stoichiometric amounts of inorganic oxidants, in addition to employing various additives, cocatalysts, and catalytic systems that result in generation of copious stoichiometric, often toxic, waste. Catalytic transfer hydrogenation methods, in which stoichiometric amounts of sacrificial organic acceptor compounds are used, also generate stoichiometric amounts of organic waste. Recent developments in catalysis by metal complexes have resulted in acceptorless dehydrogenation reactions that release hydrogen gas and in related reactions in which dehydrogenation is followed by in situ consumption of the generated hydrogen equivalents and no net hydrogen gas is liberated. These reactions circumvent the need for conventional oxidants or sacrificial acceptors and provide an assortment of applications in organic synthesis, including several methods based on further reactivity of the dehydrogenated intermediate compounds. Moreover, the evolved hydrogen gas is valuable in itself. Outlook Further development of new ADs for green, efficient chemical synthesis is expected to be greatly influenced by fundamental organometallic chemistry as a basis for catalyst design. Such processes are highly desirable and are expected to gradually displace elaborate conventional laboratory and industrial synthetic methods. They may also provide opportunities for hydrogen storage cycles, because the dehydrogenation reactions can be reversed under hydrogen pressure using the same catalyst. In general, AD and related dehydrogenative coupling reactions have the potential for redirecting synthetic strategies to the use of sustainable resources, devoid of toxic reagents and deleterious side reactions, with no waste generation.",

In contrast, inhibition of GATOR2 subunits (Mios, WDR24, WDR59, Seh1L, and Sec13) suppresses mTORC1 signaling, and epistasis analysis shows that GATOR2 negatively regulates DEPDC5. GATOR1 has GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity for RagA and RagB, and its components are mutated in human cancer. In cancer cells with inactivating mutations in GATOR1, mTORC1 is hyperactive and insensitive to amino acid starvation, and such cells are hypersensitive to rapamycin, an mTORC1 inhibitor. Thus, we identify a key negative regulator of the Rag GTPases and reveal that, like other mTORC1 regulators, Rag function can be deregulated in cancer.",

The prevailing dogma has focused on aboveground plant litter as a principal source of soil organic matter. Using (14)C bomb-carbon modeling, we show that 50 to 70% of stored carbon in a chronosequence of boreal forested islands derives from roots and root-associated microorganisms. Fungal biomarkers indicate impaired degradation and preservation of fungal residues in late successional forests. Furthermore, 454 pyrosequencing of molecular barcodes, in conjunction with stable isotope analyses, highlights root-associated fungi as important regulators of ecosystem carbon dynamics. Our results suggest an alternative mechanism for the accumulation of organic matter in boreal forests during succession in the long-term absence of disturbance.",

We applied chromosome conformation capture methods, 5C and Hi-C, across the cell cycle and revealed two distinct three-dimensional folding states of the human genome. We show that the highly compartmentalized and cell type-specific organization described previously for nonsynchronous cells is restricted to interphase. In metaphase, we identified a homogenous folding state that is locus-independent, common to all chromosomes, and consistent among cell types, suggesting a general principle of metaphase chromosome organization. Using polymer simulations, we found that metaphase Hi-C data are inconsistent with classic hierarchical models and are instead best described by a linearly organized longitudinally compressed array of consecutive chromatin loops.",

Cereblon loss in zebrafish causes fin defects reminiscent of the limb defects seen in children exposed to thalidomide in utero.

Analysis of myeloma cell lines revealed that loss of IKZF1 and IKZF3 is both necessary and sufficient for lenalidomide's therapeutic effect, suggesting that the antitumor and teratogenic activities of thalidomide-like drugs are dissociable.",

Here, I show how all cities may evolve according to a small set of basic principles that operate locally. A theoretical framework was developed to predict the average social, spatial, and infrastructural properties of cities as a set of scaling relations that apply to all urban systems. Confirmation of these predictions was observed for thousands of cities worldwide, from many urban systems at different levels of development. Measures of urban efficiency, capturing the balance between socioeconomic outputs and infrastructural costs, were shown to be independent of city size and might be a useful means to evaluate urban planning strategies.",

        "abstract": "[ Read the Introduction to this Special Section ][1]\n\n![Figure][2] \n\nCREDIT: DINA FADDAH AND RUDOLF JAENISCH/THE WHITEHEAD INSTITUTE FOR BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH\n\nThe scientific literature contains an enormous body of work in which large numbers of cells have been broken open and homogenized to prepare samples for biochemical characterization and, certainly, much has been learned from such studies. But more recently, it has become possible to monitor events in single cells, thus allowing investigators to test whether existing \u201caveraged\u201d readings of the state of many cells from traditional large-scale assays accurately represent the behavior of the individual cells being studied. Such single-cell measurements are providing a wealth of information\u2014sometimes unanticipated and often previously obscured\u2014about how cells respond to perturbations or signals. In this special issue, three Reviews provide examples of fundamental insights into cellular regulation that are revealed when it is possible to measure enzymatic activity, transcriptional responses, or the metabolic state in individual cells.\n\nAn obvious advantage of single-cell measurements is the ability to measure variations or \u201cnoise\u201d in the responses of the individual cells to similar or identical conditions. In many instances, it is possible to monitor the time course of cellular responses. Gene transcription can be particularly noisy, with bursts of RNA synthesis occurring in some cells but not others of the same population. Thus, fundamental questions arise about the nature of these systems. Perhaps variation in response is advantageous in conserving resources or in assuring that some cells survive in a changing environment. Or it may be that biophysical constraints of small numbers of molecules and the characteristics of the enzymes at work dictate such variability as unavoidable. Sanchez and Golding review recent work in model systems, from bacteria to animal cells, that attempts to resolve whether the kinetics of transcription are encoded in the architecture of promoter sequences in DNA\u2014and might therefore vary throughout the genome\u2014or are determined by physical or biophysical properties that would impose more global constraints throughout the cell.\n\nLevine et al. explore another previously hidden phenomenon. Continuous measurements of protein activation show that many undergo asynchronous pulsatile responses, which are obscured in average measurements from a population of cells. They discuss how cellular circuits are wired to produce such responses and what the advantages of such control systems might be.\n\nZenobi highlights methodological advances, particularly in mass spectrometry, that are enabling quantitation of the abundance of molecular components of single cells. Challenges abound for the goal of making simultaneous measurements to characterize the rapid ly changing metabolic state of individual cells. But the promise of new insights across a broad range of disciplines is sustaining a steady effort to tap into the large store of new knowledge lying hidden within the confines of single cells.\n\n [1]: http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6163/1187\n [2]: pending:yes",

        "title": "Scientific Discourse: Buckling at the Seams",
        "abstract": "[See All Special Issue Content][1]\n\nThomas Edison built an empire on his 1093 patents. But one innovation he considered a failure has had a lasting impact on how scientists communicate. He bankrolled the startup of Science , among the first general science journals, which debuted on 3 July 1880 with a bland description of the U.S. Naval Observatory and a cover plastered with classified ads. Science faltered at first, but in the end it thrived, and so did scientific discourse.\n\nThe mid-20th century saw a key innovation, the anonymous referee. This mechanism depends on trust, in both the integrity of submissions and in peer reviewers. That trust is being tested by a disruptive change in scientific communication: open access. Unlike traditional journals, which rely largely on subscription revenue, many open-access publications earn their daily bread through publication fees from authors. Profit is linked to volume, seemingly boundless on the Internet.\n\nAlthough the open-access world includes many legitimate journals, abuse is prevalent, as a Science investigation has found. Over the past 10 months, contributing correspondent John Bohannon submitted faux papers with blatant scientific flaws to 304 open-access journals ([60][2]). More than half accepted the paper.\n\nGranted, some traditional print publications might have fallen for our hoax, too. But with open-access journals proliferating, debate is needed about how to ensure the credibility of scientific literature. Open-access pioneer Vitek Tracz believes that anonymous peer review is sick and collapsing under its own weight. As a remedy, Tracz has launched a new open-access journal in which reports\u2014including all supporting data\u2014are reviewed after they are posted online ([66][3]). The findings and ex post facto reviews become a living document that proponents say will offer a more nimble forum for revising knowledge as it accumulates.\n\nSURVEY \n\nWhat do you think about open access publishing? Take our [ Open Access Survey ][4].\n\nAs the number of published papers (and the cost of doing research) grows, there is an increasing need to predict impact; for a novel approach, see the Report by Wang et al. ([127][5]) and an accompanying Commentary (Evans, [44][6]).\n\nThe ability to publish papers and their underlying data in full on the Internet opens new possibilities to showcase the neglected stepchild of scientific publishing: negative results. In the past, data revealing that a drug has not lived up to its promise, for example, often failed to see the light of day ([68][7]). But now they may find a niche in the limitless library of the Internet.\n\nOn the other hand, disseminating certain scientific information could pose a threat to safety and security. The recent debate over whether to publish influenza gain-of-function studies illustrates the conundrum ([70][8]). Scientists in industry, too, are struggling to define the limits of openness when communicating proprietary research, and whether some kinds of patents may actually squelch innovation ([72][9]).\n\nIn the face of changes driven by the Internet, one form of communication is surprisingly resilient. By and large, scientists are unwilling to forgo the rite of annual meetings, where they gather to argue about new research, network, and gossip ([74][10]) and to draw inspiration from top presenters ([78][11]). The vitality of the scientific meeting has given rise to a troubling cottage industry: meetings held more for profit than enlightenment ([76][12]).\n\nHow the dramatic shifts in scientific communication will affect the culture of research and processes for academic advancement and funding is far from clear (Harley, [80][13]). In the Commentary section, Konneker and Lugger ([49][14]) notes that we have come full circle: Once again, science is becoming more of a public activity. Kahan ([53][15]) describes how to use evidence effectively and what pitfalls should be avoided in communicating vaccine information to a wary public.\n\n [1]: http://www.sciencemag.org/site/special/scicomm/index.xhtml\n [2]: http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154/60.full\n [3]: http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154/66.full\n [4]: http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/5YYTRF2\n [5]: http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154/127.full\n [6]: http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154/44.full\n [7]: http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154/68.full\n [8]: http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154/70.full\n [9]: http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154/72.full\n [10]: http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154/74.full\n [11]: http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154/78.full\n [12]: http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154/76.full\n [13]: http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154/80.full\n [14]: http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154/49.full\n [15]: http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154/53.full",

        "title": "From Gas to Stars Over Cosmic Time",
        "abstract": "Background Immediately after the Big Bang, the universe was uniform, homogeneous, and completely free of stars. The gravitational collapse of dark matter gathered gas with it that cooled, collapsed further, and formed stars. Observations over the past 20 years have revealed the dynamic star-formation history of the universe. The star-formation rate peaked 10 billion years ago, when stars formed an order of magnitude faster than in the modern universe. Deep observations have begun to reveal the early history of star formation, but how quickly star formation started remains controversial, with results from observations of early galaxies suggesting a slower start than distributions of distant gamma-ray bursts that trace young stars. However, simulations using standard prescriptions for energetic feedback from star formation (from stellar explosions and ionizing radiation) have tended to predict a substantially earlier peak than either of these methods shows. Advances Energetic feedback drives turbulence in diffuse gas that both promotes and inhibits star formation, with inhibition dominating over promotion, so that star formation does not efficiently trigger further star formation. Insufficient numerical resolution in simulations causes unphysical radiative cooling to occur in multiple ways, reducing the effectiveness of feedback in driving turbulence. Other mechanisms\u2014such as magnetorotational instability, radiative heating, or accretion from the intergalactic medium\u2014must also contribute to the observed gas velocity dispersions. Radiation pressure appears likely to be only modestly effective because of Rayleigh-Taylor instability in gas accelerated by it. Observed correlations between gas surface density and star-formation rate surface density can be reproduced by models including gravitational instability. Molecule formation may occur as a result of gravitational collapse rather than initiating it. Thus, gravitational instability seems to determine star formation, with the level of turbulence setting the critical density for instability. Outlook Determining the early history of star formation will require the efforts of the largest ground and space-based telescopes under construction, such as the James Webb Space Telescope , the European Extremely Large Telescope, and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. Progress in models requires both better algorithms and larger computers. Adaptive meshes, both structured and unstructured, will play a critical role, as will hybrid algorithms that can take full advantage of the shared memory nodes of massively parallel computer clusters. A clear picture of star formation will underpin our understanding of the evolution of galaxies, including our own Milky Way, and of the history of the production and distribution of the elements heavier than helium, including those necessary for planet formation and for life.",

        "abstract": "We knew they had to be there. Once people realized that the Sun is a star and that the planets travel around it, it was only natural to suspect that other stars had planets of their own. Confirmation, however, didn't come until the early 1990s, when astronomers found compelling signs of smaller bodies orbiting first pulsars and then normal main-sequence stars.\n\n![Figure][1] \n\nCREDIT: ESO/T. PREIBISCH\n\nToday, it is estimated that our galaxy contains at least as many planets as stars. Almost 900 have been detected, and a few thousand others are under investigation. Observations have shown that planets are not only common but also extremely diverse, with our solar system being just one example of this diversity and perhaps even a rather unusual one. As described by Howard (p. [572][2]), the most commonly observed class of planetary system so far consists of one or more planets one to three times the size of Earth, orbiting much closer to their star than Earth does to the Sun.\n\nOver the next decade, astronomers plan to find and characterize habitable planets. William Borucki et al. (p. [587][3]) have taken a step toward this goal by detecting two small planets (1.4 and 1.6 times the size of Earth) in the habitable zone of a star smaller and cooler than the Sun. In this Report, the habitable zone is defined as \u201cthe annulus around a star where a rocky planet with a CO2-H2O-N2 atmosphere and sufficiently large water content (such as on Earth) can host liquid water on its solid surface.\u201d Seager (p. [577][4]) argues that the habitable zone concept needs to be expanded to include other possibilities such as hydrogenrich atmospheres and reduced water inventories. Given the expected diversity of exoplanet atmospheres and interiors, she suggests that habitability must be considered on a case-by-case basis rather than as a one-size-fits-all definition if we are to increase our future chances of detecting chemical signatures of life. Finding these signatures will be difficult, however, and once they are detected, we may not be 100% certain that they were produced by life.\n\nMeanwhile, in the field of planetary discovery itself, the signs of life could not be stronger. Every month, the orbiting Kepler telescope alone sights hundreds of new potential exoplanets in a patch of sky near the constellation Cygnus. Several more ground- and space-based missions are either in progress, in the works, or under consideration. To help nonexperts navigate this brave new world of world-finding, News writers Yudhijit Bhattacharjee and Daniel Clery (p. [566][5]) survey some of the main techniques and research efforts in line for the next round of planetary discoveries, and Lizzie Wade (p. [570][6]) presents a not-too-technical guide to exo-nomenclature. In the News Focus section (p. [542][7]), Bhattacharjee profiles Kepler's creator, Borucki.\n\nNow for the next step: finding things we don't know are there\u2014discoveries that will quickly render this special section out of date.\n\n [1]: pending:yes\n [2]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.1233545\n [3]: /lookup/volpage/340/587?iss=6132\n [4]: /lookup/volpage/340/577?iss=6132\n [5]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.340.6132.566\n [6]: /lookup/volpage/340/570?iss=6132\n [7]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.340.6132.542",

Mubeen et al. report on an integrated platform in which plasmons excited in gold nanorods (\u223c50 nm in diameter) create electron-hole pairs for driving the reaction. The nanorods are capped with a thin layer of titanium dioxide decorated with platinum nanoparticles, which act as the hydrogen generation catalysts. The sides of the nanorods are decorated with an inorganic cobalt-based oxygen evolution catalyst, so the nanorod also acts as the wire that completes the circuit. The plasmonic nature of the excitation generation was verified by showing that when operated as a photocathode (no cobalt catalyst but with a counterelectrode), the current generated tracked the changes in visible light intensity with wavelength. Indeed, the device operates less efficiently when illuminated only in the ultraviolet. Although the photon-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency is still low (\u223c0.1%), improvements such as increasing the surface area devoted to the platinum catalyst could be made. The device could also be used in tandem with devices that are more efficient in the ultraviolet than in the visible range.\n\nNat. Nanotechnol. 10.1038/nnano.2013.18 (2013).",

Cell adhesion and cortical tension, with their associated forces, contribute to such changes. Crowded cells are pushed and pulled, but some make their own way via cell-autonomous migration or chemotaxis. These events proceed in an amazingly precise, choreographed manner, both temporally and spatially. Distinct germ layers and ultimately the stereotypic body form result, with amazing robustness. This special issue presents exciting advances in understanding morphogenesis, or the development of body shape.\n\nMorphogenetic events are quickly coming into focus through new imaging techniques. Science 's online Review by Philipp Keller (p. [1234168][3]) looks at recent advances, with numerous figures and movies exemplifying the exciting possibilities to detail the dynamics of development as seen by light microscopy of live organisms. Morphogenesis can be viewed at short or long temporal scales to fit with fast subcellular rearrangements or slow organismal events, respectively, and at ever-expanding tissue depth. By combining imaging techniques with computational approaches and mathematical models, new facets of developmental discovery are made possible.\n\nEpithelia are characterized by layers of densely packed cells that are joined by strong adhesive contacts. These tissues provide structural integrity to developing embryos and adult organs and serve as barriers to pathogens and protection from dehydration. Despite what appears to be a set structural form, epithelial cells display active dynamics with fluid behavior. Guillot and Lecuit (p. [1185][4]) review mechanical aspects of epithelial cell junctions in cell division, cell extrusion, and cell intercalation, in which cells change shape and location to drive local tissue deformation.\n\nStem cells are uniquely able to self-renew and differentiate. Recent work shows that when certain stem cells are placed in the right environment, they can self-organize to form organlike structures. Sato and Clevers (p. [1190][5]) review research in which single Lgr5 stem cells develop into epithelial organoids that resemble in vivo intestinal epithelium. This in vitro morphogenesis provides complex structures that can be used for stem cell and organ research as well as disease modeling and regenerative medicine.\n\nA collection of News articles on Mysteries of Development (p. [1156][6]) explores what we don't yet understand about how growing organisms control size, how symbionts help drive development, why brains lose so many cells as they mature, and how the fetal environment shapes later health. By continuing to probe the components, movements, and mechanics involved in development, a deeper understanding of the makings of organismal life is gained, with expanded opportunities to address events when things go awry.\n\n [1]: http://www.sciencemag.org/site/special/morpho/index.xhtml\n [2]: pending:yes\n [3]: http://www.sciencemag.org/content/340/6137/1234168.full\n [4]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.1235249\n [5]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.1234852\n [6]: http://www.sciencemag.org/content/340/6137/1156.full",

It is also known that volcanic activity can be influenced by surface mass loading and the resulting isostatic adjustment of the underlying Earth and that glacial cycles change the distribution of water and ice on the crust. Therefore, the possibility that volcanism might vary in accordance with Milankovich periodicities (changes in the amount and distribution of solar energy incident on Earth due to variations in its orbital configuration) in response to glacial cycling has been an intriguing one. Kutterolf et al. present the most comprehensive data set yet to address this idea, developed from an extensive collection of marine sediment cores from around the Pacific Ocean basin. From these cores, they were able to show that the frequency of circum-Pacific volcanism varied with a 41,000-year period, the obliquity band of Milankovich cycles, and that changes in volcanic activity lagged slightly behind glacial unloading, consistent with the idea that eruptions are forced by the mass distribution variations attendant with deglaciations.\n\nGeology 10.1130/G33419.1 (2012).",

Not surprisingly, math professors teach the math itself, without describing how it could be applied in a scientific setting. What would happen if instead, science departments began teaching core math skills in the context of science curriculums? Schlotter suggests that in chemistry, this question can be evaluated once a statistics curriculum addressing the specific needs of chemistry majors has been established. The main challenge in developing such a curriculum is to truly keep topics to a core minimum; a difficult task considering that the availability of computers and software has not only increased the amount and frequency of routine statistical tests, but has also put a larger emphasis on students needing to understand how, and when, to apply statistical concepts appropriately. Although a tradeoff exists in removing chemistry topics from the curriculum to make room for statistics instruction, Schlotter argues that without it students will have little more understanding of statistical tests than where to find the buttons on their calculators. A draft version of a statistics curriculum for chemists is presented, and Schlotter welcomes comments from the science community.\n\nJ. Chem. Educ. 90 , 51 (2013).",

Numerous reports highlight favorable features of particular experimental catalysts in this context, but cross-comparisons have proven challenging in the absence of established standards for the testing conditions. McCrory et al. offer a preliminary framework for making apples-to-apples comparisons of catalysts for the oxygen-evolving half of the couple. They report benchmark tests of nine representative non\u2013precious metal catalysts deposited on glassy carbon electrodes, under standardized acidic (1 M sulfuric acid) and basic (1 M sodium hydroxide) conditions. After first assessing the active surface area for normalization, the authors measured the overpotential necessary to attain a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and then tracked performance over 2 hours. None of the tested non\u2013precious metal catalysts were stable in acid, highlighting a priority for further research.

They used benzene as the hydrocarbon source (at partial pressures up to \u223c4 torr) at substrate temperatures of 900\u00b0C. During growth in the absence of air, a shift in the main C1s XPS peak indicated that graphene was coupled to metallic copper. After cooling in vacuum and air exposure, the main carbon feature underwent a shift indicative of decoupling of the graphene from the surface via oxygen intercalation, rather than surface oxidation. Visualization of this decoupling with ESEM revealed an island-growth process proceeding from the edges of the island inward. However, if air was present during growth, there was an increase in the carbon peak associated with carbon deposition at defect sites; surface oxide formed, and roughly half of the graphene present was decoupled from the surface.\n\nNano Lett. 13 , 4769 (2013).",

Georgescu et al. modeled the hydroclimatic effects of the boom in sugarcane production within south-central Brazil, where most of the sugarcane plantations are located and where further intensification is expected. In their model, conversion from other cropland or savannah to sugarcane leads to a cooling by around 1\u00b0C at the peak of the growing season, because sugarcane reflects more incoming sunlight than does the former land cover. Warming by \u223c1\u00b0C is found after harvest. Rainfall changes were more difficult to predict, but the authors suggest that a net annual drop in the transfer of water from land to atmosphere could lead to reduced rainfall. Christidis et al. analyzed past observations and model results to find out whether land-use changes across the world have had an effect on temperature extremes. Trees absorb more incoming sunlight than grassland; thus, replacing trees with grasslands tends to cool the climate. The authors find that this effect of land-use change can be detected in mean and extreme warm temperatures, although the effect is much smaller than the warming caused by other human influences on the climate. These two studies suggest that land-use changes must be included in projections of future climate change.\n\nGeophys. Res. Lett. 10.1002/grl.50206; 10.1002/grl.50159 (2013).\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

The protein Matrimony (Mtrm) directly interacts with Polo and appears to quench its activity. It appears that this may be the primary role of Mtrm in the cell, because the genetic effects of loss of Mtrm can be restored in cells in which Polo is also depleted. Phosphorylation-dependent binding of Polo to its targets is well characterized, but the interaction with Mtm occurs in a different manner that may be more characteristic of Polo's interaction with its regulatory partners. Two domains of Mtrm appear to trap Polo and restrain its activity. Both proteins accumulate during meiosis I, and if Mtrm is lacking, proper meiosis is not achieved.\n\nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Yet many aspects of the emission and dispersal of mercury remain unclear. Eckley et al. have undertaken a detailed study of local ground-level air mercury concentrations near the Flin Flon, Manitoba, copper smelter. Until its closure in 2010, this was Canada's largest point source of mercury emissions. The closure provided the opportunity to study atmospheric mercury concentrations before and after the shutdown of a large point source. Although atmospheric mercury concentrations fell after the closure, they remained higher than at other Canadian monitoring stations, both in the atmosphere and in precipitation. Surface-to-air flux from local polluted soils is thus the most likely source of the elevated atmospheric mercury concentrations after closure.\n\nEnviron. Sci.

Heinz et al. now report that this x-ray binary is the youngest known yet. Data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory and from the Australian Telescope Compact Array, a radio telescope composed of six 22-m antennas, show that the neutron star is still within the supernova remnant in which it was born. A supernova remnant, the radiating material that is left after a star explodes at the end of its life, does not stay visible for very long. In this case, the age of the remnant constrains Circinus' age to less than 4600 years. Such a young age explains the system's rapid orbital evolution and highly eccentric orbit, which had been puzzling. There has not been enough time yet for the orbit to be tidally circularized from the eccentricity it received in the explosion. Because the neutron star is known to have a low magnetic field, the young age also implies that neutron stars can be born with low magnetic fields or can easily become demagnetized.\n\nAstrophys.

Such skills are essential for day-to-day human interactions and are particularly important in bonded relationships. The ability to understand another's perspective and wants has generally been considered to be  to humans, but the benefits of such skills could confer an adaptive advantage for many species. Thus, these skills may be present in non-human animals but just difficult to demonstrate. Ostojic et al. use a suite of controlled experiments in Eurasian jays and find evidence that state attribution is present in these monogamous birds. Specifically, consumption of one preferred food by females reduced their desire for it later, when compared with another preferred food. They showed that males were attuned to this specific satiety and flexibly offered females the preferred food that they had not been offered previously. The authors ruled out several alternative explanations, such as the potential that the female was giving behavioral cues during the feeding: Males had to be able to observe the initial feeding in order to best judge what the female would most want next. Besides demonstrating that male Eurasian jays make thoughtful and observant mates, these results suggest that state attribution may not be ours alone.\n\nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Because these films are polycrystalline, a variety of twist angles between the layers were created across the surface and resulted in a patchwork of colored regions that appeared red, yellow, or blue. Raman spectroscopy was used to characterize the twist angles; the enhancement of the G peak at \u223c1600 cm\u22121 occurred at optical excitation wavelengths that differed for the red and yellow regions, and the extent of enhancement corresponded to the deviation of the orientation of the layers from a distinctive critical twist angle. The twist angles were also confirmed by low-energy electron diffraction studies.

Surface air temperatures for periods before direct measurements were made systematically and broadly enough to be useful on global scales are inferred from sources such as tree rings, corals, ice cores, speleothems, and marine sediments, which provide proxies for temperature. What do proxy records say about modern global warming, though? Anderson et al. present an independent record of climate warming over the past 130 years, assembled from a collection of 170 temperature-sensitive paleo proxies, which show the same warming trend as the instrumental record over the same time, including the more detailed picture of warming from around 1910 to the 1940s, the pause in temperature rise until the 1960s, and a continuation of warming from the 1960s to the present. This work validates both the modern instrumental record of temperature rise and the use of these proxies to reconstruct the temperatures of the past.\n\nGeophys. Res.

        "abstract": "Physics\nThere are several different approaches to quantum information processing currently under development, including (but not exhaustively) superconducting circuits, nitrogen vacancy defects in diamond, and semiconductor quantum dots. Each one relies on the basic building block of a qubit, a two-level quantum system, on which the information can be stored and manipulated. In the semiconductor quantum dot approach, manipulating the spin of a single electron is promising because it has all the requirements: being fast, controllable and stable. A downside, however, has been the issue of scalability. Any useful quantum processor will require a system of many qubits, but getting quantum dots to talk to each other has presented a challenge. Addressing a preliminary point of this issue, Schaibley et al. show that the light (a single photon) emitted from the excited state of a charged quantum dot is entangled with the spin of the electron on the dot. The authors argue that by making the single photons emitted from other distinct quantum dots interact, it may be possible to then entangle the spins on these quantum dots and thus realize a scalable architecture.\n\nPhys.

Recent advancement in rapid and low-cost exome sequencing make it an attractive alternative to traditional targeted gene panel sequencing for clinical research, while maintaining the possibility of discovering mutations in genes previously not associated with a disorder. Furthermore, the exome encompasses approximately 1% of the genome, yet contains approximately 85% of disease-causing mutations, making exome sequencing easier and cheaper than whole genome sequencing for identifying disease-causing variants in research. Researchers are now applying proband-father-mother (trio) exome sequencing to uncover variants that potentially either cause or modify the condition under study.

To see if bigger brains are better and what the tradeoffs might be, Kotrschal et al. experimentally addressed the effects of selection for brain size in guppies ( Poecilia reticulata ). After only two generations of selection, the authors obtained populations of fish whose brains were larger or smaller than normal and differed from one another by about 10%. The big-brained female fish (but not the males, for some unknown reason) were better than those with smaller brains at a task where the fish associated the number of symbols (two or four) with a food reward. The cost of the increased brain power was a decrease in the size of the gut and a decrease in reproductive function. The brain is very active metabolically, and thus its growth must be balanced against the cost of maintaining other processes in the organism. The offsetting effect on reproductive function is consistent with interspecies comparisons in which more intelligent mammals, such as humans, whales, and dolphins, have decreased fertility.\n\nCurr.

Moving from the pre\u2013genome-era identification of single gene variants associated with hereditary cancers, advances in sequencing technology have enabled the use of a whole-genome approach to examine the differences between the genomes, and epigenetic regulation, of tumor and patient DNA. This issue of Science examines how these advances are shaping our current understanding of cancer at the genomic level.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no magic bullet, as no single genetic variant or epigenetic effect has been identified as a target in the fight against all cancers. In a comprehensive Review, Vogelstein et al. (p. [1546][2]) distill information derived from more than 100 cancer genome sequencing projects into a series of clear principles about tumor biology and then discuss the projected clinical impact of cancer genome analysis on early detection and treatment of the disease. Kilpivaara and Aaltonen (p. [1559][3]) call for standards for cases in which whole-genome sequencing reveals clinically relevant mutations in individual patients to bridge differences between the laboratory and the clinic. McLeod (p. [1563][4]) reviews how best to apply pharmacogenomic information in identifying and tailoring drugs to target cancers. Finally, Suva, Riggi, and Bernstein (p. [1567][5]) examine how cell fates are controlled by epigenetic regulation and identify parallels between cancer and cellular differentiation.\n\n![Figure][6] \n\nCREDIT: MEHAU KULYK/SCIENCE SOURCE\n\nIn addition, Science Signaling presents related content on 26 March and 6 April, highlighting how cancer-associated alterations in the genome or proteome can result in altered signaling that contributes to tumorigenesis, metastasis, and drug resistance. Our Science News department profiles Elaine Mardis (p. [1540][7]), whose expertise in developing DNA sequencing technology led her to become a pioneer in cancer genomic research, and explores how the heterogeneity of individual tumors, revealed by sequencing studies, poses treatment problems. Science Careers profiles Fatima Al-Shahrour, a bioinformaticist who works on interpreting the genome to help select more effective drugs for cancer patients.\n\nTechnological breakthroughs, coupled with the greatly reduced costs of sequencing, suggest that in our not-too-distant future, routine cancer treatment will not focus on the organ of origin but rather on the genomic profile of the cancer. This fundamental goal, to be able to read the complex code embedded in our bodies to identify the best therapies for each individual over the course of their treatment, portends a medical enlightenment.\n\n [1]: http://www.sciencemag.org/site/special/cancergenomics/index.xhtml\n [2]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.1235122\n [3]: /lookup/volpage/339/1559?iss=6127\n [4]: /lookup/volpage/339/1563?iss=6127\n [5]: /lookup/volpage/339/1567?iss=6127\n [6]: pending:yes\n [7]: /lookup/volpage/339/1540?iss=6127",

He launched a new section of the journal, News and Comment, and staffed it with journalists, not scientists. His rationale: Fundamental changes were taking place in the funding and organization of research, and it was becoming increasingly important for scientists to know about and understand events shaping the scientific enterprise. A decade later, he added another journalist-written section, Research News, that would report on new findings and trends in research itself. This time, he reasoned that because research was becoming ever more specialized, scientists needed objective reporting on developments in disciplines outside their own. Under the leadership of early News editors such as Daniel S. Greenberg and Allen Hammond, the News sections quickly became among the most widely read parts of a journal that has continued to publish the very best research papers.",

It was determined that the strain field developed around BZO nanodots embedded in REBCO matrix is a key driving force dictating the self-assembly of BZO nanodots along REBCO c-axis. The size selection and spatial ordering of BZO self-assembly were simulated using thermodynamic and kinetic models. The BZO self-assembly was controllable by tuning the interphase strain field. REBCO superconducting films with BZO defects arrays self-assembled to align in both vertical (REBCO c-axis) and horizontal (REBCO ab-planes) directions, resulted in the maximized pinning and Jc performance for all field angles with smaller angular Jc anisotropy.

Laboratory work by Gudipati et al. shows that tholin formation can continue at low altitudes, down to 200 km from the surface and below, through longer-wavelength photochemistry in condensed organic aerosols. They synthetized dicyanoacetylene (C4N2), a compound that has been detected on Titan and can be used as a model system for other larger unsaturated condensing compounds, cooled it to 100 K, a temperature relevant to Titan's lower atmosphere, and irradiated it with laser-produced light at 532, 355, and 266 nm. Solar light at wavelengths longer than 200 nm is expected to penetrate through Titan's atmosphere and make it to low altitudes without much attenuation. In the simulations, irradiation of C4N2 ice with light at wavelengths as long as 355 nm induced the formation of tholins. These organic compounds, which do not occur naturally on Earth, can thus be produced on Titan by different photochemical processes at different atmospheric altitudes.\n\n![Figure][1] \n\nCREDIT: NASA/JPL-CALTECH/SPACE SCIENCE INSTITUTE\n\nNat.

Thompson and Skaggs use the lead isotope ratios in silver from silver hoards to investigate trade patterns during a Mediterranean \u201cDark Age\u201d between 1200 and 800 BCE precipitated by the collapse of palace-based economies in the Near East. Lead isotope analysis of 48 precoinage silver artifacts from what was southern Phoenicia [the region between the Yarkon River and Akko (Acre) in present-day Israel] and dated from 1200 to 800 BCE shows that they have isotope ratios similar to those of galena (the mineral form of lead sulfide) and other lead ores from southern and southwestern Sardinia, and the Iberian Peninsula. These analyses tentatively identify regions in the western Mediterranean as contributing mineral resources to Phoenician precolonial silver trade and production. The results correlate with ancient documentary sources indicating Phoenician precolonial silver trade with Sardinia and Spain and suggest that the Phoenician precolonial expansion into the west may have involved the acquisition of silver. Thompson and Skaggs further support suggestions that the legendary Tarshish region, a possible source of King Solomon's silver, may have been a refinery town, possibly Nora, on Sardinia.\n\nInternet Archaeol. 35 , 10.11141/ia.35.6 (2013).\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

Morra et al. statistically analyzed the organization of large and small plates across Earth's surface over the past 200 million years, based on models of plate reconstructions. Small plates do not show much statistical variation in their distribution over time, because they are largely unstable and form from unrelated events. Large plates, however, tend to organize either into heterogeneous or homogenous states based on plate size distributions over \u223c100-million-year time scales. The rapid rate at which heterogeneous distribution states are stabilized suggests that these may be excited states, whereas homogeneous distribution states tend more toward equilibrium. In this case, the underlying driving force for the transition from one state to another depends on cycling between top-down and bottom-up mantle convection as a control on plate motion.\n\nEarth Planet.

These N-heterocyclic carbenes, or NHCs, are frequently stable and possible to isolate and have been applied as ligands in transition-metal catalysts. They are also versatile catalysts in their own right. Nonetheless, the question of whether thiamin itself reacts as a catalytic carbene in native context has remained open.

The F. novicida CRISPR locus encodes a small CRISPR/Cas-associated RNA (scaRNA) that has complementarity to both a trans-acting crRNA (tracrRNA) and its own lipoprotein gene. The scaRNA, together with the tracrRNA and Cas9 nuclease, acts to repress expression of the F. novicida lipoprotein during host infection. This allows the infecting bacteria to avoid detection by one of the host's pathogen pattern recognition receptors, which binds to bacterial lipoproteins, and activates the host's innate immune response.

Coral calcification rates decreased significantly as pH and aragonite saturation decreased, in a manner consistent with that exhibited by the same species in laboratory carbonate manipulation experiments.

Chen adds to the lengthy and continuing discussion of this question by linking language to future-oriented behaviors, such as a child who resists the temptation to eat one marshmallow right now so as to be given two marshmallows to enjoy just a few minutes later. He does so by noting that the marking of future tense is obligatory in some languages (French) and suggests that this induces a cognitive representation of the future as being distinct from the present; in other words, tomorrow is less a continuation of today and more a new day altogether. This leads to the expectation that countries in which so-called strong future-time reference languages predominate would exhibit lower rates of future-oriented behavior, such as saving and exercise. Looking across countries in the World Values Survey confirms this prediction, even after controlling for various geographic, cultural, and institutional factors. Furthermore, looking within countries, such as Switzerland, that feature both strong and weak future-time reference language speakers reveals that the German-speaking Swiss save at more than twice the rate of their fellows on the other side of the linguistic divide.\n\nAm.

They discovered that sleep deprivation decreased functional connectivity between a brain area called the posterior cingulate cortex and the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex. In contrast, connectivity between the dorsal nexus, a region that plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of depression, and two areas within the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was increased. These sleep deprivation\u2013induced changes in resting-state connectivity indicate a shift in dominance from a more affective to a more cognitive network.

The catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 into methanol offers a potential route for conversion, but most commercial catalysts, which use copper and zinc oxide supported on alumina and operate at pressures of 50 to 100 atm, have low single-pass conversions and require product separation and reactant recycling. Bansode and Urakawa, noting that high pressures thermodynamically favor the methanol product, studied this reaction on such catalysts at higher pressures. They could boost single-pass conversions to >95% at 355 atm and 260\u00b0C and at high H2 partial pressures (H2/CO2 ratios > 10:1). These conditions should suppress formation of CO as a final product, but the increasing conversion for methanol as temperature was increased to 260\u00b0C suggests that the reaction proceeds initially through reduction to CO. This reaction is endothermic and competes with exothermic methanol synthesis. They also show that addition of a solid acid catalyst, H-ZSM-5, as a physical mixture led to the single-pass production of dimethyl ether with selectivities of >80%; when this catalyst was added in a second series reactor, light alkanes or propylene could be produced as well.\n\nJ.
