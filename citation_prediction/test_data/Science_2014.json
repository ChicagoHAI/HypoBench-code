        "abstract": "Advancing perovskite solar cell technologies toward their theoretical power conversion efficiency (PCE) requires delicate control over the carrier dynamics throughout the entire device. By controlling the formation of the perovskite layer and careful choices of other materials, we suppressed carrier recombination in the absorber, facilitated carrier injection into the carrier transport layers, and maintained good carrier extraction at the electrodes. When measured via reverse bias scan, cell PCE is typically boosted to 16.6% on average, with the highest efficiency of ~19.3% in a planar geometry without antireflective coating. The fabrication of our perovskite solar cells was conducted in air and from solution at low temperatures, which should simplify manufacturing of large-area perovskite devices that are inexpensive and perform at high levels.",

The 5-AVA templating created mixed-cation perovskite (5-AVA)x(MA)1-xPbI3 crystals with lower defect concentration and better pore filling as well as more complete contact with the TiO2 scaffold, resulting in a longer exciton lifetime and a higher quantum yield for photoinduced charge separation as compared to MAPbI3.

Among Columbea, we identify pigeons and flamingoes as belonging to sister clades.

Despite maintained carcinogen exposure, tumors from smokers showed a relative decrease in smoking-related mutations over time, accompanied by an increase in APOBEC-associated mutations. In tumors from former smokers, genome-doubling occurred within a smoking-signature context before subclonal diversification, which suggested that a long period of tumor latency had preceded clinical detection.

        "abstract": "Cancers are composed of populations of cells with distinct molecular and phenotypic features, a phenomenon termed intratumor heterogeneity (ITH). ITH in lung cancers has not been well studied. We applied multiregion whole-exome sequencing (WES) on 11 localized lung adenocarcinomas. All tumors showed clear evidence of ITH. On average, 76% of all mutations and 20 out of 21 known cancer gene mutations were identified in all regions of individual tumors, which suggested that single-region sequencing may be adequate to identify the majority of known cancer gene mutations in localized lung adenocarcinomas. With a median follow-up of 21 months after surgery, three patients have relapsed, and all three patients had significantly larger fractions of subclonal mutations in their primary tumors than patients without relapse. These data indicate that a larger subclonal mutation fraction may be associated with increased likelihood of postsurgical relapse in patients with localized lung adenocarcinomas.",

We show that by harnessing notions from parity-time (PT) symmetry, stable single\u2013longitudinal mode operation can be readily achieved in a system of coupled microring lasers. The selective breaking of PT symmetry can be used to systematically enhance the maximum attainable output power in the desired mode.

This uncertainty is much smaller than the range from the traditional UN high and low variants. Much of the increase is expected to happen in Africa, in part due to higher fertility rates and a recent slowdown in the pace of fertility decline.

In contrast to conventional ring cavity lasers with multiple competing modes, our parity-time microring laser exhibits intrinsic single-mode lasing regardless of the gain spectral bandwidth. Thresholdless parity-time symmetry breaking due to the rotationally symmetric structure leads to stable single-mode operation with the selective whispering-gallery mode order.

Trained monocytes display high glucose consumption, high lactate production, and a high ratio of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) to its reduced form (NADH), reflecting a shift in metabolism with an increase in glycolysis dependent on the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) through a dectin-1-Akt-HIF-1\u03b1 (hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1) pathway.

In our system of coupled microresonators, EPs are manifested as the loss-induced suppression and revival of lasing. Below a critical value, adding loss annihilates an existing Raman laser. Beyond this critical threshold, lasing recovers despite the increasing loss, in stark contrast to what would be expected from conventional laser theory. Our results exemplify the counterintuitive features of EPs and present an innovative method for reversing the effect of loss.",

More than half of cis-eQTLs identified, involving hundreds of genes and associated pathways, are detected specifically in stimulated monocytes. Induced innate immune activity reveals multiple master regulatory trans-eQTLs including the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), coding variants altering enzyme and receptor function, an IFN-\u03b2 cytokine network showing temporal specificity, and an interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF2) transcription factor-modulated network. Induced eQTL are significantly enriched for genome-wide association study loci, identifying context-specific associations to putative causal genes including CARD9, ATM, and IRF8. Thus, applying pathophysiologically relevant immune stimuli assists resolution of functional genetic variants.",

Learning a new motor skill (such as juggling) alters the structure of the brain's white matter, which contains many OLs, suggesting that late-born OLs might contribute to motor learning. Consistent with this idea, we show that production of newly formed OLs is briefly accelerated in mice that learn a new skill (running on a \"complex wheel\" with irregularly spaced rungs). By genetically manipulating the transcription factor myelin regulatory factor in OL precursors, we blocked production of new OLs during adulthood without affecting preexisting OLs or myelin. This prevented the mice from mastering the complex wheel. Thus, generation of new OLs and myelin is important for learning motor skills.",

In a subset of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cases, we found that heterozygous somatic mutations are acquired that introduce binding motifs for the MYB transcription factor in a precise noncoding site, which creates a super-enhancer upstream of the TAL1 oncogene. MYB binds to this new site and recruits its H3K27 acetylase-binding partner CBP, as well as core components of a major leukemogenic transcriptional complex that contains RUNX1, GATA-3, and TAL1 itself. Additionally, most endogenous super-enhancers found in T-ALL cells are occupied by MYB and CBP, which suggests a general role for MYB in super-enhancer initiation.

For such a thin membrane, the primary barriers to separation come from entrance and exit from the holes and not from the motion through the membrane.",

To accomplish this, we developed shape-memory composites that fold themselves along embedded hinges. We used these composites to recreate fundamental folded patterns, derived from computational origami, that can be extrapolated to a wide range of geometries and mechanisms. This origami-inspired robot can fold itself in 4 minutes and walk away without human intervention, demonstrating the potential both for complex self-folding machines and autonomous, self-controlled assembly.",

We found that the cingulate (Cg) region of the mouse frontal cortex powerfully influences sensory processing in the primary visual cortex (V1) through long-range projections that activate local \u03b3-aminobutyric acid-ergic (GABAergic) circuits. Optogenetic activation of Cg neurons enhanced V1 neuron responses and improved visual discrimination. Focal activation of Cg axons in V1 caused a response increase at the activation site but a decrease at nearby locations (center-surround modulation). Whereas somatostatin-positive GABAergic interneurons contributed preferentially to surround suppression, vasoactive intestinal peptide-positive interneurons were crucial for center facilitation. Long-range corticocortical projections thus act through local microcircuits to exert spatially specific top-down modulation of sensory processing.",

In contrast, nonreciprocal electromagnetic propagation is commonly achieved based on the Zeeman effect, or modal splitting in ferromagnetic atoms induced by a magnetic bias. Here, we introduce the acoustic analog of this phenomenon in a subwavelength meta-atom consisting of a resonant ring cavity biased by a circulating fluid. The resulting angular momentum bias splits the ring's azimuthal resonant modes, producing giant acoustic nonreciprocity in a compact device. We applied this concept to build a linear, magnetic-free circulator for airborne sound waves, observing up to 40-decibel nonreciprocal isolation at audible frequencies.",

In less than 2 years, acclimatization achieves the same heat tolerance that we would expect from strong natural selection over many generations for these long-lived organisms.

Here, we employ this spin-orbit coupling of light to break the mirror symmetry of the scattering of light by a single gold nanoparticle on the surface of a nanophotonic waveguide. We thereby realize a chiral waveguide coupler in which the handedness of the incident light determines the direction of propagation in the waveguide. Using this effect, we control the directionality of the scattering process and direct up to 94% of the incoupled light into a given direction. This enables novel ways for controlling and manipulating light in optical waveguides and nanophotonic structures as well as for the design of integrated optical sensors.",

The greater sensitivity has occurred despite cultivar improvements and increased carbon dioxide and reflects the agronomic trend toward higher sowing densities.

We show, in experiments performed with the CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets) chamber at CERN, that sulfuric acid and oxidized organic vapors at atmospheric concentrations reproduce particle nucleation rates observed in the lower atmosphere. The experiments reveal a nucleation mechanism involving the formation of clusters containing sulfuric acid and oxidized organic molecules from the very first step. Inclusion of this mechanism in a global aerosol model yields a photochemically and biologically driven seasonal cycle of particle concentrations in the continental boundary layer, in good agreement with observations.",

        "abstract": "Pulling me apart only makes me stronger Tension transmitted between neighboring cells can exert profound effects on cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue organization. Exactly how intercellular mechanical tension is sensed at the molecular level is unknown. One attractive hypothesis is that a linkage between the cell-cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin, its binding partners \u03b1- and \u03b2-catenin, and actin filaments may act as a tension sensor. However, how this linkage is established at the molecular level is not known. Buckley et al. used optical tweezers to determine how mechanical load influences interactions of the cadherin/catenin complex with single actin filaments. The data support a model in which force shifts the interaction from a force-independent, weakly bound state to a highly force-sensitive, strongly bound state. The findings may explain how cells maintain tissue integrity while still being able to move and change shape. Science , this issue p. 10.1126/science.1254211",

This single-site gold species is active for the low-temperature (<200\u00b0C) water-gas shift (WGS) reaction. Unexpectedly, gold is thus similar to platinum in creating -O linkages with more than eight alkali ions and establishing an active site on various supports. The intrinsic activity of the single-site gold species is the same on irreducible supports as on reducible ceria, iron oxide, and titania supports, apparently all sharing a common, similarly structured gold active site. This finding paves the way for using earth-abundant supports to disperse and stabilize precious metal atoms with alkali additives for the WGS and potentially other fuel-processing reactions.",

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) control expression of thousands of genes in plants and animals. miRNAs function by guiding Argonaute proteins to complementary sites in messenger RNAs (mRNAs) targeted for repression. We determined crystal structures of human Argonaute-2 (Ago2) bound to a defined guide RNA with and without target RNAs representing miRNA recognition sites. These structures suggest a stepwise mechanism, in which Ago2 primarily exposes guide nucleotides (nt) 2 to 5 for initial target pairing. Pairing to nt 2 to 5 promotes conformational changes that expose nt 2 to 8 and 13 to 16 for further target recognition. Interactions with the guide-target minor groove allow Ago2 to interrogate target RNAs in a sequence-independent manner, whereas an adenosine binding-pocket opposite guide nt 1 further facilitates target recognition. Spurious slicing of miRNA targets is avoided through an inhibitory coordination of one catalytic magnesium ion. These results explain the conserved nucleotide-pairing patterns in animal miRNA target sites first observed over two decades ago.",

Herein, we report a rare example of catalyst-controlled C(sp(3))-H arylation using pyridine and quinoline derivatives: The former promotes exclusive monoarylation, whereas the latter activates the catalyst further to achieve diarylation. Successive application of these ligands enables the sequential diarylation of a methyl group in an alanine derivative with two different aryl iodides, affording a wide range of \u03b2-Ar-\u03b2-Ar'-\u03b1-amino acids with excellent levels of diastereoselectivity (diastereomeric ratio > 20:1).

        "abstract": "Most scientists (ourselves included) headed off to graduate school eager to discover new things, test crazy ideas, and hopefully change the world, or at least explain a piece of it. Sadly, these days such aspirations are overshadowed by fierce competition for papers, grants, and the tenured positions trainees need to build independent careers in academic research. Even those who have attained one of those rare, coveted professorships are under intense strain: A preoccupation with funding and other career-related metrics crowds out real discovery among aspiring and established scientists alike. The result: Science has become a less desirable career. We can fix the problem, but only if we're willing to make fundamental changes to how academic science is structured and funded.\n\nFor decades, trainees\u2014graduate students and postdocs\u2014have performed most of the day-to-day work of academic science. Motivated by the promise of satisfying careers, they are willing to work long and hard for minimal pay. For science, that works out well in the short term but not the long: The distinction between trainee and employee blurs. When more is invested in science\u2014a good thing\u2014the ranks of graduate students and postdocs swell to meet the demand for temporary labor. Permanent positions don't keep pace, eroding the economic and intellectual value of scientific training. Trainees take ever longer\u2014into their mid-30s and beyond\u2014to accrue credentials sufficient to stand out and get hired for serious, long-term faculty jobs. With each passing year, scientists young and old spend more time worrying about their careers and less time making discoveries. As long as academic science is structured the way it is, we don't really have a choice.\n\n![Figure][1] \n\n\u201cCareer instability \u2026 turns some of the best talent away.\u201d\n\nILLUSTRATION: ROBERT NEUBECKER\n\nSome argue that intense competition strengthens science by allowing only the fittest to survive. But the incentives that arise from such competition run counter to creativity, openness, and innovation. We may even be selecting for undesirable traits, such as recklessness and a focus on self-marketing over scientific substance. The weight put on publishing papers in high-impact journals may encourage scientists to exaggerate their findings, or worse. In short, it is evident that hypercompetition is inconsistent with \u201caffording the prepared mind complete freedom for the exercise of initiative,\u201d which Vannevar Bush, who devised our system of academic research funding in the 1940s, considered to be of \u201csupreme importance.\u201d\n\nSo why do students even start down the road to science careers? We believe it's a combination of ignorance of the realities, overconfidence, and a punch-drunk passion for science. At some point during training, however, that enthusiasm starts to wear off. Every trainee has encountered exceptionally talented students who would have made major contributions but decided to leave science\u2014its uncertain prospects, risk-averse funding, and incentives for distortion and dishonesty\u2014in favor of more practical and lucrative careers.\n\nTo draw the best young minds to research and then keep them here, we need to change how we train scientists and how academic science gets done. More of the work should be done by staff scientists in stable positions and less of it by (fewer) trainees. We should move the career bottleneck from faculty to the postdoc or even to graduate school admissions. Training grants and fellowships should replace grant support for most trainees so that more can be invested in research grants without increasing the number of trainees and further glutting Ph.D.-level science labor markets. Such measures would have useful side effects: encouraging better training and intellectual independence. More important, they would improve young scientists' career prospects.\n\nIt is time to address the career instability that turns some of the best talent away from science. The effort and investment needed to make research careers more attractive will be handsomely repaid in the form of future discoveries.\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

Between the mid-1970s and the early 2000s, the use of lead compounds in gasoline was phased out in most industrialized countries, and since then, the lead content of ambient air has fallen markedly. In the United States, the national ambient air quality standard is set for the lead content of ambient air (PbA), but humans can be exposed to lead via sources other than air, leading to the total lead measured in blood (PbB). Using PbB data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination survey and PbA data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Air Quality System for 1999\u20132008, Meng et al. investigated the relationship between PbA and PbB since the phase-out of leaded gasoline. They found that the emission sources for lead have changed, leading to a shift from a fine to a coarse PbA particle size distribution, and show that PbA in coarse airborne particles is a statistically significant predictor of PbB. The PbB levels of children are more sensitive to changes in PbA concentrations than are those of adults.\n\nEnviron. Sci. Technol. 10.1021/es4039825 (2013).\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

        "abstract": "Exercise is an essential component of the study of human physiology. The world faces enormous healthcare challenges from diseases (e.g., cardiovascular disease, obesity, and type 2 diabetes) inextricably linked to a lack of physical activity. Thus the need to understand how our bodies move and adapt to exercise has never been more relevant.\n\nInsufficient exercise is clearly not a personal issue for Christopher Gillen\u2014runner, physiologist (Kenyon College), and author of The Hidden Mechanics of Exercise . Despite its title, the book doesn't focus on whole-body joints and moment arms. Instead, Gillen's enjoyable account emphasizes the molecules and protein structures that allow us to move, run, jump, control fuel use, and regulate adaptations to exercise training.\n\n![Figure][1] \n\nForce producer. \nColored scanning electron micrograph of a freeze-fractured skeletal (striated) muscle.\n\nPHOTO: PHOTO QUEST LTD/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY/CORBIS\n\nUsing analogies to make the science accessible, Gillen takes readers through critical systems of the human body, from the molecular protein structures that allow us to store and reuse elastic energy in our tendons to the processes by which hemoglobin molecules bind and release oxygen. He effectively integrates traditional physiology with more recent developments in cell and molecular biology and genetics. He links together topics ranging from the molecular chain of events in the brain that cause us to initiate movement to the behavior of myosin (the molecular motor protein in skeletal muscle that produces force and ultimately generates movement). Refreshingly, Gillen approaches the subject from the system down rather than the molecule up. Throughout the book, he emphasizes how tiny changes in protein structures scale up to produce whole-body movements.\n\nGillen comes to the topic with the perspective of a long-distance runner (he has completed 10 ultramarathons) and not that of a power athlete. Thus he can be forgiven for some confusion regarding hyperplasia in the hypertrophic response of whole muscle to high-resistance strength training. Satellite cells may well proliferate, but that does not mean that the number of functioning muscle fibers increases. His description of proteins \u201cmorphing\u201d also becomes a little irksome after a while, but that should not detract from the enjoyable way he takes us through the different biological systems, linking each with various aspects of physical and sports performance.\n\nOverall, Gillen offers exercise enthusiasts wishing to understand the science behind their training an interesting read. The book also serves as an engaging primer for exercise-science students who want to begin to understand some of the underlying molecular mechanisms. The Hidden Mechanics of Exercise introduces concepts that make the step to the specialized textbook or research article easier. At the same time, researchers studying the behavior of the individual molecules may find Gillen's account enlightening in regard to the functional implications of their work at the whole-body level.\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

MILLER/OFFICE OF COMMUNICATIONS, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY\n\nIn the years following the Second World War, social scientists in the United States devised a series of tests for identifying what they termed the \u201cauthoritarian personality.\u201d What kinds of character traits made persons susceptible to fascist ideology? And what habits of mind correlated most closely with democratic rule? No one doubted the urgency of these questions. Much blood had been shed in the defeat of fascism in Europe. Democracy, meanwhile, had become the default regime of the West, yet its long-term viability was far from assured, given the ease with which the enfranchised masses had been won over by charismatic authoritarians in the 1930s. How American social scientists set about solving this puzzle is the subject of Jamie Cohen-Cole's rich and illuminating study.\n\nThe Open Mind can be read as a history of psychology and in particular of the construction of the research program of cognitive science\u2014a field now associated with the names of George Miller, Noam Chomsky, and Jerome Bruner. But the book can equally be read as a study of the political culture of mass democracy in the United States or as a history of the American research university and the culture that sustained it. All of this is by design, for Cohen-Cole's central thesis is that these three levels\u2014of the human mind, the academic mind, and the American mind\u2014were connected and mutually reinforcing.\n\nTo see why this conjunction of science, academia, and politics became, for a time, a potent solution to the problem of justifying mass democracy, we can turn to the classic 1950s studies of the authoritarian personality. The idea animating these investigations was that one could measure inclination toward authoritarian behavior and pick out those elements of personality that made for good citizens. One group of social psychologists even constructed a psychometric scale to record the propensity toward fascism. A variety of tools were deployed to measure an individual's place on the \u201cF-scale.\u201d The most important was the questionnaire. Subjects' responses were correlated with \u201cHigh\u201d or \u201cLow\u201d placements on the scale. In one test reported by Cohen-Cole, subjects were asked to \u201cname people they admired.\u201d The researchers identified the first group of responses (including \u201c\u2018Whitman, Pushkin, Beethoven, Voltaire, Bertrand Russell, Comte, Maimonides, Confucius, Sir William Osler, Freud, [and] Pestalozzi\u2019\u201d) with democratic character, because they indicated an esteem for \u201cintellectual, aesthetic, and scientific achievement, social contribution, and democratic social change,\u201d while the latter group (including \u201c\u2018Marshall, MacArthur, Lindbergh, the Pope, Henry Ford, Washington, Teddy Roosevelt, Kate Smith, [and] Bing Crosby\u2019\u201d) signaled an authoritarian valuation of \u201cpower and control, conservative Americana, etc.\u201d There was one obvious problem with this test, which critics were quick to point out: the first list of names was composed of those whose work would be known to, and admired by, intellectuals and the highly educated. As Cohen-Cole drolly notes, \u201cthe individuals admired by democratically minded Americans\u201d were, in the words of one critic, \u201clargely unknown to non-intellectuals.\u201d\n\n![Figure][1] \n\nCognitive scientist George A. Miller.\n\nPHOTO: JOHN T. MILLER/OFFICE OF COMMUNICATIONS, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY\n\nSomewhat astoundingly, however, this was an assumption the investigators would have been comfortable with. For the ideal type of democratic character was, in effect, read off from the intellectual virtues increasingly associated with a certain kind of academic intellectual. These virtues included creativity, flexibility, openness to new ideas, autonomous thinking, tolerance of ambiguity or complexity, and an ability to work across cultural or institutional dividing lines. In short, the kind of open-mindedness associated with leading figures in the scientific disciplines, and especially in the social sciences, became a model for the democratic citizen more generally. Similarly, the narrow-minded, gate-keeping mentality that defined the views of those prone to authoritarianism in politics was projected onto the \u201cdogmatic\u201d defenders of a narrowly empirical form of psychology known as behaviorism. For the early proponents of cognitive science, behaviorists like B. F. Skinner and Stanley Smith Stevens were not just uncongenial colleagues: they were persons who could not recognize the creative, reflexive character of human cognition, which they sought to reduce merely to observable correlations between stimulus and response. The cognitive psychologists' repudiation of behaviorism was therefore pervaded by normative notions of what made for the best scientific minds and for democratic personalities.\n\nOne of the most powerful features of Cohen-Cole's account of the emergence of cognitive science is precisely that it refuses to reduce cognitive psychology to democratic politics. The arrows of social causation point in several directions: from a set of concerns about American society in an age of specialization and mass conformity to the academy, but also from cognitive science to the interdisciplinary culture of the postwar university and then outward toward the uncertain landscape of Cold War era politics. While no science exists in a bubble, political culture, in turn, is not impervious to changing scientific conceptions of human nature. The Open Mind also shows how the consensus on the value of the open mind helped to create a backlash from the New Left and New Right that eventually rent it asunder in the 1960s and 1970s. Anyone who wants to know about American democracy in the postwar era, and the special place of psychology within it, will profit enormously from reading Cohen-Cole's excellent study.\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

        "title": "A giant leap",
        "abstract": "In 1960, my grandfather ascended to 102,800 feet in a gondola lifted by a polymer balloon and, after saying a brief prayer, jumped. He fell for more than 4 minutes before landing safely in the desert of New Mexico, proving that people could survive the hostility of space, and pioneering technology to protect human life in that environment. Years later, a reporter asked Alan Shepard\u2014the first American in space\u2014if he would have jumped. \u201cHell no,\u201d he said.\n\nLately, it feels like I'm making my own giant leap. I've spent the past decade building up academic credentials, doing all the things a scientist needs to do to land a faculty appointment. I've published frequently in good journals, more each year. I've landed competitive funding from respected sources and built a research program that involves postgraduates. I've taught several classes and mentored graduate students.\n\n![Figure][1] \n\n\u201cMy grandfather fell for more than 4 minutes before landing safely.\u201d \n\n\n\nMost of this has been rewarding. But in the overly busy mode that most researchers operate in, I found I was feeling less bullish about academia as I knew it and increasingly uncertain it was the right fit.\n\nI had the benefit of several mentors who encouraged me to explore other career options, and in 2013, I took a half-time appointment with a conservation-focused nonprofit as a scientist with an applied focus. I was tasked with supporting their conservation programs with the best available science, working across fields to bring together insights that could inform conservation practice.\n\nI was surprised to find I enjoyed this work much more than basic research. I could see findings being put to work, and the healthy debate about how to adapt research into practice was invigorating and challenging. I gained a new appreciation for the importance of moving research out of the ivory tower, and for the skills needed to engage in that translational role.\n\nIronically, at about that time, my academic job searches finally started to yield fruit. I was invited for two faculty interviews, both at top-tier research universities. During one, I entered a pressure-cooker group interview, where faculty members lob hard questions at you while you try not to squirm. One of them asked me, \u201cJack, fast-forward 35 years. We are celebrating your career and accomplishments at your retirement party. What are we celebrating?\u201d\n\nI gave a safe answer: \u201cI made an impact on my field of scholarship. I trained some graduate students who have gone on to successful careers\u201d and so on. First she nodded\u2014 but then she banged the table emphatically. \u201cThat's not good enough,\u201d she said.\n\nShe was right. In that split second of terror, I realized what my real bar for accomplishment was. It wasn't developing new theory, pioneering new methods, or getting research published in the best journals. I answered again: \u201cYou're right. The bar for me is that when my career is winding down, because of my work, something is different in the water.\u201d What I meant was, when I'm done I want to be able to say that I've had a measurable, significant impact on the environment I work to improve. \u201cThat's more like it,\u201d the professor responded.\n\nThis interaction haunted me for weeks because it compelled a follow-up question: \u201cIf this is my measure for success, what work must I do to achieve it?\u201d I did some deep thinking and realized that my conservation work\u2014not my academic research\u2014was the work that would help me achieve those lofty goals.\n\nI recalled seeing a presentation months before, in which the presenter asked his audience, \u201cWhat got you into this field in the first place?\u201d My answer: \u201cI got in because I wanted to make things better.\u201d But since then, my goals had shifted insidiously; my academic mentors were training new versions of themselves, and I had gone along. I had strayed from my original intention to use new knowledge to effect real-world change. And although I believe ardently that people can create change in a variety of work environments, I knew I needed to pursue a career that would ultimately be more rewarding. That's why I decided to make the leap.\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

        "abstract": "It seems like a rite of passage now for Ph.D. students: confronting the harsh prospects of academic careers. I'm just at the beginning of my doctorate at New York University (NYU) in New York City, but already my peers are concerned about how to survive within academic institutions. Our career paths are described as risky undertakings, littered with pitfalls and wrong turns, and the journey can often lead to a dead end. At first I shared their anxiety, but I started to wonder about how this would affect my development as a scientist. How can one produce the best science while focusing on survival? If students remain in a constant state of competitiveness, they may end up trading their creativity for a shortsighted scramble for results. Would merely surviving fulfill my goals?\n\nI decided it was better not to overthink the whole survival thing. Negativity paired with a good imagination can be crippling. As with experiments, sometimes it is best to relax expectations until you see the results.\n\n![Figure][1] \n\n\u201cThe Abu Dhabi project helped me understand what environmental biotech strives to achieve.\u201d\n\nILLUSTRATION: ROBERT NEUBECKER\n\nAs I was thinking along these lines, I was offered a rotation project at NYU Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. The goal was to develop algae strains that could be used as a cheap source of biofuel. As in all rotation projects, I was given a taste of the research, but I didn't have time to really sink my teeth in. I embraced the opportunity because I wanted to work on an environmental biotech project, but I didn't expect to save the world.\n\nMy 9 weeks in Abu Dhabi provided something unexpected: a renewed sense of purpose.\n\nAbu Dhabi is a rapidly evolving urban center; think Chinese megacities. What makes Abu Dhabi remarkable is that it survives in the middle of a desert. What little arable land and fresh water Abu Dhabi has cannot provide for a city that size. Resources must instead be created from scratch.\n\nI'm passionate about environmental biotechnology, but up until that point, my exposure to the subject had been limited to the scientific literature and some small adventures in the lab. The Abu Dhabi project helped me understand what environmental biotech strives to achieve. It became clear that innovations in algal wastewater treatment and salt-tolerant crop breeding could be real game changers in an environment that provides so little. Many Western cities also depend on advanced infrastructure to stay afloat, but in Abu Dhabi the need was much more obvious.\n\nThis forced me to think differently about my sources of motivation. I became less concerned about how I was going to survive or what I was going to do after my Ph.D. I got more interested in the potential impacts of environmental biotechnology. I suppose the effect might be similar to what medical scientists who work at hospitals experience: Proximity to the site of application inspires a certain kind of urgency. This urgency, I believe, is better for science than that provoked by the academic rat race.\n\nHow does Ph.D. research affect the world? As obvious as it sounds, this question is often overlooked during grad school. It's easy to lose sight of the larger purpose of your research, especially when you are distracted by concerns about survival. I suspect this distraction is present at other career stages as well.\n\nNow that I'm back in New York, the experience in Abu Dhabi seems a bit like a desert mirage, but it continues to influence my thinking. I got a glimpse of how my environmental biotechnology research could have a wider impact.\n\nWrestling with a research question is a rewarding intellectual exercise, but an appreciation of the broader context of the research can enrich it. These multiple sources of motivation leave little room for career-related anxiety.\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

        "abstract": "![Figure][1] \n\nA couple defies the years at the Luckenbach, Texas, dance hall.\n\nPHOTO: ROBB KENDRICK\n\nShould we consider aging a natural part of life or an illness? When it comes to the brain, research has tended to focus on the negative side of aging\u2014Alzheimer's disease, for example. Yet all of us know individuals who continue to be mentally sharp their whole lives. And history repeatedly offers proof\u2014Titian, Socrates, da Vinci, and so on\u2014that great creativity and insight can come with maturity.\n\nThis special issue of Science therefore looks at the mechanisms and contexts of successful brain aging. The developmental trajectory of the brain through the entire life span is affected by genetic, physical, and psychological factors. One thing we know already is that our mental lives benefit when we lead lives that are not only physically healthy but also intellectually challenging and socially engaged (Lindenberger, p. [572][2]).\n\nAs we age, our brains constantly reorganize in response to new experiences. Even after adverse physical or psychosocial events, such as a stroke or a loved one's sudden death, there is an astonishing level of flexibility in the brain that enables an individual to compensate and adjust (Gutchess, p. [579][3]). Indeed, the language systems of the brain, responsible for some of the richest human interactions, have an inbuilt resilience that ensures that they remain largely robust across the life span (Shafto and Tyler, p. [583][4]).\n\nAlthough many researchers are closely watching how individuals age cognitively (Underwood, p. [568][5]), aging populations have global implications for economies and societies (Harper, p. [587][6]). These demographic transformations have to be much more widely discussed if societies are to become well prepared, both mentally and on an institutional level, for the challenges they present.\n\n [1]: pending:yes\n [2]: /lookup/volpage/346/572?iss=6209\n [3]: /lookup/volpage/346/579?iss=6209\n [4]: /lookup/volpage/346/583?iss=6209\n [5]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.346.6209.568\n [6]: /lookup/volpage/346/587?iss=6209",

        "abstract": "Not long ago, Science Careers posted a widget\u2014you can find it at  \u2014that lets early-career scientists calculate the probability that they'll someday become principal investigators (PIs), on the basis of a few standard publication metrics. The widget builds on work published 2 June in Current Biology ( ) in which the study's three authors\u2014all early-career computational biologists\u2014used PubMed data to study the influence of some 200 factors on academic scientists' career trajectories. Built by John Bohannon, a contributing writer for Science Careers, and David van Dijk of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel (the lead author of the Current Biology study), our widget employed a simplified model based on the same data set.\n\n![Figure][1] \n\nFirst-author publications count far more than middle-author publications.\n\nILLUSTRATION: ROBERT NEUBECKER\n\nThe Science Careers widget is less accurate than the full-bore model, but it has the virtue of focusing attention on a handful of the most important parameters. Just enter values for a few mostly familiar metrics, and the widget displays a graph of PI probability\u2014the probability of eventually occupying the last-author position on a peer-reviewed article\u2014versus the parameter of your choosing. That makes it useful for savvy early-career scientists planning their ascents to independence. If they use it that way, they'll learn the following lessons:\n\n1.  Be male. The widget's probability plot displays two lines: red for women and blue for men. The blue line is above the red line across the whole range of probabilities, no matter what variable you display on the ordinate. In the scenario I ran, a woman needed two extra first-author publications or seven extra middle-author publications to reach the same probability of becoming a PI as a man with an otherwise identical record.\n\n2.  Be selfish. Do you value collaboration? Too bad: In my testing, an extra first-author publication increased the odds of becoming a PI by 17%; it would take eight middle-author publications to get a comparable boost. So, think twice before giving away that prized first-author slot.\n\n3.  Be elite. According to our widget, the institution you train at doesn't matter much\u2014unless you're at one of the top 10 universities in the Academic Ranking of World Universities. Then, it matters a lot. In one scenario, moving from the number one institution (Harvard University) to the number two institution (Stanford University) decreased the chance of becoming a PI significantly more than moving from the 10th institution in the ranking (the University of Oxford) to the 100th (the University of Freiburg).\n\n4.  Publish in journals with high impact factors. If you've signed the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment ( ), or you just don't think a metric designed for a journal should be used to evaluate individual scientists, avert your eyes: Journal impact factor has a strong influence on a scientist's probability of attaining PI-ship. It's apples and oranges, but to the extent that a comparison can be made, the influence of journal impact factor seems stronger than that of either the number of citations your most cited article has received or of h-index, which is meant to measure a scientist's productivity and impact. You might say, then, that the impact factor of the journals you publish in matters more than your own personal impact factor.\n\nNone of these results is terribly surprising, but they are more than a little depressing. These four factors, all of which were found to be among the most important ingredients of academic career success, are at best indirectly linked\u2014and at worst not linked at all\u2014to rigorous, serious, and significant science. The real value of the PI-predictor widget, then, is not that it can help early-career scientists plan their careers; in fact, we should hope they don't use it that way. Its real value, rather, is that it so clearly demonstrates the wide gap between science's ideals and incentives. If we want young scientists to remain idealistic, then we need to figure out how to do a better job rewarding the things that really matter: discovery (often as part of a team) and solutions to society's most compelling problems.\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

        "title": "Feeling your pain <b>Pain A Political History</b> <i>Keith Wailoo</i> Johns Hopkins University Press, 2014. 292 pp.",
        "abstract": "![Figure][1] \n\nTo experience pain, whether acute or chronic, is to know the limits of communication; it is to find ordinary human expression wanting. Yet, as medical historian Keith Wailoo, shows us, that same private experience prompted eloquent professional and public debate in the United States during the late 20th century. We might struggle to articulate our own pain, but some medical and legal experts, along with leading politicians, have been quick to judge the pain of others.\n\n\u201cThe claims made about pain and about people in pain,\u201d writes Wailoo, \u201cwere central to the ongoing battle between liberals and conservatives stretching back to World War II.\u201d He tells a compelling story of conflict between liberals sensitive to others' pain and conservatives often suspicious of others' (if not their own) assertions of pain and disability. In his telling, it is a very American story, though he leaves the impression that it might be, in fact, a generic modern tale.\n\nWailoo artfully uses antithesis in his description of the moral calculus of bodily suffering in American politics. Thus, he positions Bill Clinton's \u201cfeeling our pain\u201d against Rush Limbaugh's denunciation of the phoniness of such liberal sympathy. Of course, Wailoo takes care to observe the actual complexity, even messiness, of the postwar politics of pain recognition and evaluation\u2014even so, partisan polarity inevitably organizes his narrative. Democrats and Republicans consistently perceived different boundaries between deserving pain and undeserving fraud. \u201cWhat it means to be liberal or conservative became ideologically solidified around the problem of pain,\u201d Wailoo writes. While readers will learn about the development of pain medicine in the United States during this period, the book's strength and novelty lie in its attention to the political and cultural dimensions of pain. Wailoo reveals how a private experience such as pain can be rendered as a moral calculus and translated into various partisan public programs.\n\nIn tracing the connections of personal pathology and national politics, Wailoo covers an extensive terrain. He begins with an account of political ambivalence toward pain and disability during the Eisenhower administration, when respect for disabled veterans conflicted with fears of encouraging welfare and drug dependency. The idiosyncratic character of pain frustrated the efforts of a new cadre of experts to find an objective measure for it. A more-liberal cultural environment in the 1960s emphasized instead subjective criteria in pain evaluation. Pain often became tied to claims for social recognition and demands for medical relief or government support. Ever skeptical, conservatives began to speak more loudly about learned pain, learned helplessness, and dependency. In the Reagan years, Wailoo argues, pain theories came to echo these conservative sensibilities. \u201cQuestions of which\u2014and whose\u2014pain mattered most and how to deal with people in pain,\u201d he notes, \u201ccontinued to be socially and politically divisive.\u201d Just as 19th-century reformers might distinguish between the deserving and undeserving poor, policy-makers in the late 20th century tried to determine who suffered real pain and therefore warranted treatment or welfare. Nevertheless, efforts have never been disinterested.\n\n![Figure][1] \n\nCREDIT: CHRIS WARE\n\nWailoo provides examples of how the race, gender, and social marginality of sufferers influenced politicians' and bureaucrats' appreciation of pain. He explains the exquisite sensitivity of some conservatives to the presumed pain of fetal innocents and their indifference to the undeniable pain of those tortured by the military. Toward the end of the book, Wailoo describes the effects of deregulating the market for pain medication at the turn of the century, which resulted in some Americans getting overmedicated with opioids and other drugs, while many of those who were more marginalized continued to receive inadequate pain relief. At this point, reenter Limbaugh, stage right. Wailoo makes much of this reactionary celebrity's secret addiction to pain medication, which sat uneasily with his supposed dismissal of the pain of others. For Wailoo, Limbaugh seems to epitomize the hypocrisy of republican virtue.\n\nPain: A Political History is a deeply felt and provocative history of the political uses to which pain has been put in modern America. Over the course of his distinguished career, Wailoo has moved from meticulous, somewhat inward-looking, historical studies of laboratory research toward more ambitious and politically engaged analysis of what the late Arnold Relman, editor in chief of the New England Journal of Medicine , called the medical-industrial complex.

        "abstract": "![Figure][1] \n\nA miller's daughter spun gold thread from hay. Stone soup fed an entire town. A farmer grew tons of juicy melons in one of the harshest desert climates in the Americas. In each story, something is created from nothing.\n\nOf the three, only the story of the Chihuahuan melon farmer is neither fairy tale nor parable. Centuries-old technology known as olla irrigation breathes life into acres of melon vines, enabling them to thrive in an otherwise inhospitable environment. The paltry 9 inches of annual rainfall is harnessed to support a robust agricultural business. Judicious water use and resource conservation are the main tenets of desert farming worldwide, transforming arid scrubland and desert margins into flourishing and resilient farmsteads.\n\n![Figure][1] \n\nOlla irrigation. PHOTO: NMSU AGRICULTURAL COMMUNICATIONS/PHOTO BY J. VICTOR ESPINOZA\n\nGary Nabhan is a conservation scientist, ecologist, and farmer; he is intimately familiar with the challenges faced by traditional desert agricultural communities. He visits with farmers in Saharan oases and the margins of the Gobi Desert, as well as other desert regions, learning the techniques and adaptations that have sustained life in extreme environments for thousands of years. A full third of the land on our planet is desert or semi-desert, receiving on average less than 20 inches of rainfall per year ([ 1 ][2]). Over the tens of thousands of years of human migration and agricultural evolution, societies have found elegant and simple solutions to living in water-compromised environments.\n\nThese solutions are increasingly relevant as countries experience progressively hotter average temperatures and face dwindling water resources. Dramatic changes are already being witnessed by ecologists and experienced by farmers. Pests such as bark beetles have been able to spread without a cold-weather check, damaging and killing thousands of trees in U.S. and European forests. Severe drought conditions in the United States this year have left 385,000 acres of farmland fallow in California alone ([ 2 ][3]). Desert vegetation has adapted to its environment over millennia. Each native species contains a wealth of evolutionarily derived resiliencies in form and function. Scientists and traditional farmers have drawn on these botanical success stories to shape physical farmland, advance water harvesting, and create hardy agricultural ecosystems. Biomimicry of living desert systems in particular has been a noted success, especially the use of nurse trees to create microenvironments in which crops can blossom.\n\nEach chapter contains a Planning and Practice section with practical step-by-step advice on how to create desert-adapted and ecoconscious garden and agricultural landscapes. Lessons range from reducing summer heat loads on houses to creating effective rain irrigation, inspired by traditional farming on the floodplains of the Sonoran Desert. These solutions are both ingenious and effective, drawing on our global heritage to solve today's problems as well as prepare for those of the future.\n\nBy learning from agricultural desert experiences, farmers, scientists, and ecologically conscious citizens will be prepared for the challenges created by future climate change.\n\n1.

        "title": "What is in a word <b>The Dyslexia Debate</b> <i>Julian G. Elliott and Elena L. Grigorenko</i> Cambridge University Press, 2014. 290 pp.",
        "abstract": "![Figure][1] \n\nWhile many of us take for granted our ability to read, this is not the case for many individuals in society, with approximately one-quarter or more of U.S. students typically performing at Below Basic levels on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (2013). The causes for such poor performance are likely multifaceted, including downstream effects from environmental influences, such as lack of appropriate schooling, as well as biological difficulty in learning how to read. While The Dyslexia Debate would appear on the surface to cover only a segment of individuals with reading difficulty (dyslexia), the book really tackles broader issues of those who struggle to read, regardless of origin or how we actually label it.\n\nThe Dyslexia Debate provides an up-to-date and comprehensive synthesis of what is known about the cognitive and neurobiological origins of reading difficulty. The book also highlights that, despite considerable scientific progress in this area, the field is still in its infancy in terms of understanding why so many individuals struggle to learn to read, what should be done to help, and how to best operationalize reading difficulty in terms of definition and label(s).\n\nAt the outset, Julian Elliott (at the School of Education, Durham University) and Elena Grigorenko (at the School of Public Health, Yale University) review all of the different definitions of dyslexia, from its earliest conceptualization to current definitions across various organizations and countries. Although this section is perhaps somewhat lengthier than necessary, it is extremely valuable in revealing why there is so much debate about the exact definition of dyslexia and thus, in turn, why there is debate in how to label those who struggle with reading. Some use the terms \u201cdyslexia\u201d and \u201creading difficulty\u201d synonymously; others consider difficulty in sounding out words and dyslexia as synonymous; and yet others use dyslexia entirely differently, as a distinct disorder from other reading difficulties. The review also provides an important context, as there is one fundamental constant across all definitions: substantial struggle with reading has a biological basis and origin. While environment can modify this biological predisposition, in what manner, under what conditions, and how biological and environmental variability and their interactions result in different reading outcomes are largely unknown.\n\nHerein lies one of the central themes throughout the book: the tools that we currently have to dissect out biological and environmental contributions or to disentangle the specifics of reading difficulty, and even more so the specific case of dyslexia, are not sufficient. While Elliott and Grigorenko are able to point to some clear generalities in terms of cognitive characteristics (phonological processing weaknesses) and neurobiological signatures (left hemisphere anomalies), the picture becomes much more complex when examined further. Processes may exist either in addition to or as a distinct subtype of reading difficulty, such as visual attention and lower-level deficits contributing to phonological processing weaknesses. Additionally, while historically it has been suggested that reading difficulty is linked to corresponding strengths, fully unpacking this information is needed.\n\n![Figure][1] \n\nPHOTO: RTIMAGES/ALAMY\n\nThe debate over how we should label reading difficulties, and whether dyslexia is a term that should remain in use, is addressed head on toward the end of the book. There, Elliott and Grigorenko challenge us to think about what we can say and do using the current state of the science and raise the thought-provoking idea that dyslexia is not in and of itself a helpful term. Their opinions are largely centered on the fact that no specific cut points exist and therefore definitions are variable; they suggest that we should thus retire the term \u201cdyslexia\u201d and use \u201creading disability\u201d to capture anyone who struggles with reading at the word level until a later time when we can understand better the relevant distinctions.\n\nShould we subsume all reading difficulty under one label because we currently can only detect reading on a continuum and can't disentangle environment and biology? Although this is enticing in its simplicity, I respectfully disagree: Science needs to evolve so that we can make distinctions between various types of reading difficulties, and the dyslexia label, along with the broader reading disability term, pushes us to keep propelling science forward. This issue of fuzzy boundaries occurs in multiple developmental disorders\u2014and many other medical disorders for that matter [some argue that most medical disorders are not discrete; for an example, see ([ 1 ][2])].\n\nThus, Elliott and Grigorenko, perhaps unknowingly, provoke us to think not only about dyslexia per se but about the struggle across multiple developmental disorders that present on a continuum. Throughout medical history, there are instances in which disorders have been defined in one manner, but then the definitions are refined and more-precise boundaries are set as the science evolves.\n\nOne then circles back to what Elliott and Grigorenko close with: that the issue is not so much in using the label of dyslexia or not but in understanding how to best define the boundaries and cut points. Right now we don't have the tools to make these very clear demarcations. But, as they state, just because we don't yet have the tools to unravel the complex interactions between genes, brain, and environment, it does not mean that the problem doesn't exist. This, ultimately, is the heart of the issue for defining, diagnosing, and most importantly helping those overcome reading difficulty. The Dyslexia Debate provides us with a thought-provoking way to consider these issues and challenges us to figure out the best ways to tackle them while we wait for the evolution of science to provide the greatest clarity.\n\n1.

        "title": "Risk and responsibility <b>The Social Roots of Risk Producing Disasters, Promoting Resilience</b> <i>Kathleen Tierney</i> Stanford Business Books, 2014. 317 pp.",
        "abstract": "![Figure][1] \n\nAwareness of financial, technological, physical, and terrorist disasters across the globe is high as modern communication systems relay details and graphic footage into our homes. Yet the solutions seem remote, as if they can only be handled and understood by specialists and experts and not by us. Kathleen Tierney very effectively disabuses us of this in a powerfully written account of how all types of disaster are socially produced, that is, the result of social processes and decision-making. She carefully constructs her case using familiar social science literatures and a wide range of examples of disasters from different geographical regions. It is good to see work on risks and disasters coming together, because so often they are considered apart. The transatlantic divide on these topics is also partially overcome by using the work of European theorists to set the scene about the relationship between risk, modern societies, and technological risks. Tierney skillfully and critically pushes the boundaries of her arguments to embrace the social production of natural risks. A popular example would be climate change, socially produced and exacerbated by a collective failure to control its causes.\n\n![Figure][1] \n\nRethinking our roles in preparing for and responding to catastrophic events.\n\nPHOTO: CHARLIE RIEDEL/AP\n\nDecision-making is crucial to the social production of risk. It takes place at different levels of social living, from social cognition, through organizational, social, structural, and ultimately global levels of decision-making. Navigating through these levels and the complex theories that help us to understand the social roots and channels of risk is difficult. We need to grasp the parameters that shape what we see and know, for example, cultural assumptions that inform our prioritization of goals and our ability to envision worst-case scenarios. There may be institutional blindness and organizational barriers to collective sense-making and risk management. The literatures on these subjects are large, scattered, and multidisciplinary and brought together admirably in this work.\n\nA strong theme of the book is inequality: why are some communities and countries much more severely affected by disasters than other communities experiencing similar events? Power is part of the answer: the power to define, frame, and prioritize risks. Economic power is regarded as paramount, especially the power to sanction rapid urbanization and the concentration of populations alongside large industrial sites in areas of natural hazard. Here, we have a clear example of the social production of risk as the result of decision-making that has unequal, socially structured effects: they render the poor, elderly and migrant communities particularly vulnerable.\n\nThere are also significant inequalities between nations, where developed nations tend to experience the greatest monetary loss from disasters and less-developed countries tend to suffer the greatest loss of life.\n\nJust as risks are socially constructed, so are their solutions. The main focus of this work is \u201cresilience,\u201d a relatively new concept in which a great deal of faith has been placed. Resilience refers to the ability to absorb system shocks and to cope, adapt, and bounce back from disruption. This can entail major reorganizations at different social levels from the individual to the household, community, and economy. Tierney shares faith in resilience but is careful to explain the difficulties in implementing this approach. Her discussion of the concept is comprehensive, cutting through multiple literatures to identify its core characteristics. How to achieve resilience is the bottom-line question and one she tackles head on. She explores sources of resilience and how it might be assessed and promoted. Notions of robustness, redundancy, resourcefulness, and rapidity emerge as important. These allow the strength and flexibility necessary to promote resilience. \u201cSocial capital\u201d emerges as a precondition for developing and maintaining other forms of capital that might help overcome vulnerability in the event of a disaster. Cooperation and social contacts within and between groups can enhance resilience and help to access wider networks and resources.\n\nResilience planning is not about abandoning predisaster planning but having the flexibility to adapt plans or knowing when to put them aside. This may involve new emergent groups, especially networks that appear much more resilient than hierarchies: They can tap into diverse sources of information and resources and build on preexisting social capital. Predisaster planning enhances adaptive capacity.\n\nPolicy recommendations flow from this. For instance, civil society groups often take the lead in disasters, and they can be helped to be better prepared to enhance community resilience. Governance and regulation are also important. They are embedded in the social, economic, and political structures that produce them. Tierney recognizes this in relation to the ability to resist regulation, but the sections on capture are less convincing. The forces that weaken regulators are much more subtle and complex than the notion of capture conveys. Regulators often work in political and legal conditions that prevent them from doing their job. There are moments of resistance, most often in the wake of disasters, such as the new confidence in regulation that has emerged in the wake of the financial crisis. It may be helpful to coopt and embrace a mix of state and nonstate regulation, combining civil and even economic regulation to help in the transformational change Tierney envisages but sees as unlikely to take effect.\n\nThis book has high and perhaps unrealistic aspirations, but it is important reading. It makes a convincing case about why natural and social science disciplines need to work together toward risk and disaster reduction. In doing so, we need to be mindful of some of the danger of expecting that we can fully anticipate and manage risks, allowing space for resilience and unorthodox approaches to develop.\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

        "abstract": "I was valedictorian of a large public high school in Florida, attended a top liberal arts college\u2014Swarthmore\u2014and majored in physics. After a short, post-college stint as a small-town journalist, I entered the physics Ph.D. program at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. I connected early with a research project that allowed me to publish often and well, although I did not love the work. I finished my Ph.D. fairly quickly\u2014faster than I needed to really because my wife, a chemist, was still in graduate school. So I stayed in the same lab for a postdoc, doing the same work, funding the position with a grant proposal written by me and submitted in my adviser's name. From graduate school on, I do not remember receiving a single piece of career advice.\n\nA year or so into my postdoc, my adviser retired. I took over his lab, earning a very long title: visiting research assistant professor. I inherited some '80s-vintage electronics and a '60s-era lab with a desk in the corner.\n\n![Figure][1] \n\nI appeared successful. I was running my own funded lab and publishing in good journals.\n\nILLUSTRATION: MARC ROSENTHAL\n\nAs my wife approached the end of her Ph.D., we began to consider our \u201ctwo-body problem.\u201d We agreed that we would accept the first good offer either of us received.\n\nMy job-market timing could not have been worse. The dissolution of the Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc sent many physicists and other scientists streaming west. Big corporate labs were downsizing and moving away from basic research, sending veteran physicists onto the academic job market. The early '90s employment crisis among young Ph.D. physicists made news. (You can read about it in Science at  .)\n\nI appeared successful. I was running my own funded lab and publishing in good journals. But it wasn't long before I realized that I wasn't competitive for tenure-track positions at the institutions where I wanted to work, including the one where I was already working. One rejection letter among the many I received thanked me for being part of a \u201cremarkable cohort\u201d of more than a thousand applicants for a single faculty post. I believe the number actually exceeded 1300.\n\nMy wife applied for just one job and got the offer. I became the trailing spouse, following her to Maine, where she took up a faculty post. I took pride in defying science's gender stereotypes.\n\nIt was surprisingly easy to walk away from the career that I had worked so long and hard to attain. The hard part came later as I lost my knowledge of science and saw my mathematical facility dwindle, and as I struggled to fashion an identity that wasn't linked to professional attainment.\n\nI turned to writing, and when I wasn't writing, I was repairing and maintaining a passive-solar house in the country: shoveling snow, hauling tons of firewood up a steep hill, planting a vegetable garden that didn't get enough sun, and fulfilling various back-to-nature cliches. For a while, I taught writing part-time to undergraduates; it was ideal training for the work that would come later. We soon had a son, and (except for the breastfeeding part) I was the primary parent.\n\nIn 1999 I founded an Internet publication, The Post-Careerist, which was focused on living a rich post-professional life. Through connections I made online, I became science editor at a pioneering Internet publication, BlueEar.\n\nThen, via an acquaintance in Pakistan\u2014this was early online networking, before LinkedIn and Facebook\u2014I heard about a writer/editor position at Science 's Next Wave, Science Careers' predecessor. I sent an e-mail and within weeks found myself with a full-time job for the first time in years. A few years later, I became the editor of Science Careers.\n\nMy science career story is hardly unusual. Indeed, what's remarkable is how much it shares with so many other nontraditional career stories: uncertainty, exploration, a difficult transition, self-invention, and (eventually) satisfaction.\n\nSo what's your story?

        "abstract": "On a bright July day more than 3 decades ago, I turned up at the physics department of the University of Delaware (UD), Newark, hoping to meet my new research adviser. I was met instead with quizzical looks: The professor had died some months before I arrived. No one had told me. \u00b6 I had come a long way. After finishing a master's degree in physics at the University of Calcutta, I had become interested in biophysics. I had decided to pursue a Ph.D. studying the physical properties of nucleic acids and had won admission to UD, with a teaching assistantship. I packed my bags, got my passport and tickets, and said farewell to family and friends. Half a world from home, I was left scratching my head, contemplating my next step. What would I do? I had student visa requirements and little money. I taught physics labs that summer as I pondered my future.\n\n![Figure][1] \n\n\u201cMy career has taken several sudden, unexpected twists and turns.\u201d \n\nILLUSTRATION: ROBERT NEUBECKER\n\nA month later, I was taking a short cut through the biology department when I came upon an outline of a graduate cell biology course that would be offered in the fall. I liked it. I sought out the professor, told him my story, and proposed doing a biology Ph.D., even though I had never taken a college-level biology course. He looked at me as if to say, \u201cYou can't be serious.\u201d Still, he agreed, with conditions: I had to get an A in his course, and I had to take the biology Graduate Record Exam (GRE).\n\nThe fall semester was busy and tense. I was enrolled in the physics graduate program, taking a full course load, and I was teaching lab courses. I also took the cell biology course. I got an A. I took the GRE and was admitted to the graduate program in biology.\n\nThere were many new things to learn. I took makeup courses, taught lab courses, and did research. It was a wonderful experience. Toward the end of the program, I got married.\n\nI finished my Ph.D., and my wife and I moved to France, where I did a postdoc at the CNRS-LGME in Strasbourg\u2014again the packing of bags, obtaining of visas, fond farewells, the start of a new life on a new continent. I worked hard in Strasbourg but also had fun, traveling around, sampling the local cuisine, and traversing the fabled Route du Vin. Three years later, we returned to the United States, and I began my professional career.\n\nI worked in metabolic disease drug discovery in the pharmaceutical industry for more than 22 years. I worked hard, published papers, presented at national and international conferences, and took fun vacations. Life was good. Last year, the company where I had more than 15 service years ended R&D efforts in diabetes and eliminated several positions, including mine. This was not as shocking as the news of the dead adviser, but it was a major jolt nonetheless. I took the severance package and found myself wondering, \u201cWhat now?\u201d for the first time in more than 30 years.\n\nA committed traveler and avid reader of travel magazines, I decided to try writing travel articles. I wrote a few articles on Indian wildlife that I had photographed on safaris and a piece on an interesting experience I had when my car broke down on the freeway near Philadelphia. I sent them off to journals and blogs. Three have been accepted, one by a popular U.S. magazine, the second by a major newspaper, and the third by the Indian government for publication on a new government website. It's not a bad start to a writing career.\n\nMy career has taken several sudden, unexpected twists and turns. Careers are like that these days. I have accepted the challenges as they've come and done my best to overcome them, with reasonable success. I have always viewed my job as a means to an end, to enjoy life and work. Research offered those rewards\u2014until it didn't. Now I have set off on another kind of exploration.\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

The reason remains a mystery. Worobey et al. used genetic and evolutionary approaches to infer that for much of the 19th century, a flu virus strain containing the same subtype of the hemagglutinin protein (H1) as the Spanish flu infected children. This gave them good immune protection from subsequent infections with H1-containing viruses. But from 1880 to 1900, the H3 subtype replaced H1 in circulating flu strains, and so people born between these times were less immune to H1. Around 1907, a novel H1-containing flu emerged, eventually becoming the deadly 1918 pandemic. With little protective immunity to H1, young adults exposed only to H3 subtypes during childhood suffered the greatest mortality.\n\nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

        "title": "What are the chances?The Improbability Principle Why Coincidences, Miracles, and Rare Events Happen Every Day <i>David J. Hand</i> Scientific American/Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2014. 283 pp.",
        "abstract": "![Figure][1] \n\nWe have all experienced coincidences or rare events that we find difficult to believe. Throughout history, people have tried to find an explanation for the occurrence of such events, and these have often taken a supernatural form. For example, people have provided explanations that rely on superstitious beliefs, the intervention of a higher power (such as a god), or an unknown force such as extrasensory perception. It may be a part of human nature to explain rare events in such a way. However, David Hand (at Imperial College London), in The Improbability Principle , presents a rational set of rules that, once understood, can explain why we all experience such events. Instead of relying on supernatural explanations, he argues that the laws of nature suggest that we should not be surprised by rare events. In fact, he tells us, even unlikely events happen all the time.\n\nThe majority of the book is concerned with describing a set of five rules that together form the Improbability Principle. Each rule is explained using a multitude of real-world examples. The author draws from diverse topics, including parapsychology (the scientific study of paranormal phenomena), financial markets, and gambling. Such examples are embedded within accessible lessons on the rules of probability.\n\nThe law of inevitability describes the simple fact that something must happen. If you hit a golf ball, it must land somewhere. The possible landing locations consist of a huge list of improbable events (at least before you hit the ball), but one of these has to happen.\n\nIn the 1990s, a group of people took advantage of this law to try to win the Virginia State Lottery. The jackpot was abnormally large at $27 million, and the consortium calculated that there were just over 7 million possible sequences of numbers that could win. Therefore, if they could buy 7 million tickets, all with unique sequences, they could make a profit of $20 million. The probability of a particular ticket winning was still low, but one of the tickets had to win.\n\nThe law of truly large numbers describes the fact that there are often an extraordinarily large number of opportunities for rare events to happen. The probability of one person being struck by lightning within a year is 1 in 300,000. But with Earth's population reaching 7 billion, lightning strikes don't seem so surprising.\n\nThe law of the probability lever says that a small change in circumstances can have a huge impact on the expected probabilities of events. A tragic example of this law contributed to the wrongful imprisonment of a woman who had lost two children to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The juries were told that the probability of losing two children to SIDS was 1 in 73 million and that a double homicide was much more probable. However, the probability of losing a second child to SIDS increases if you have already lost one child, and this was not factored into the original probability calculation. The conviction was overturned because of medical evidence, but the judges also criticized the statistical evidence as \u201cgrossly misleading\u201d ( ).\n\nThe law of selection manifests itself in a variety of ways, all centering on how probabilities can be modified by the manner in which you select the events. For example, publication bias can lead to an overrepresentation of positive results from clinical trials. Another example of this law, hindsight bias, can suggest that we should have been able to predict an event based on evidence presented after the fact.\n\nSpeed cameras provided Hand with an excellent example of the law of selection in action. These are placed to prevent future accidents. Locations are selected based on the number of road deaths that have occurred in the preceding year, and then the number of deaths over the next year are measured. At this point, it would be tempting to attribute any reduction in deaths solely to the introduction of speed cameras. But we can't do this, due to the manner in which we selected the locations\u2014only including those with very high death rates. Some of the original deaths were chance events, unrelated to any potential local hazards. There will be a reduction in the following year independent of cameras or any other intervention. It is equivalent to rolling 100 die, then selecting only those that landed on a six to roll again. You would expect only some of these die to land on a six again. A proper experiment would have to randomly select the speed camera locations so that these random fluctuations can be separated from the effect attributable to speed cameras.\n\n![Figure][1] \n\nPHOTO: STEVE MASON/THINKSTOCK\n\nThe final rule, the law of near enough, describes how our assessment of coincidences can actually increase the perceived likelihood of their occurrence. Things don't have to be an exact match for us to regard them as identical, and thus we expand the number of potential matches that we interpret as rare events.\n\nThroughout the book are many examples of the consequences of being unaware of aspects of the Improbability Principle, and so the final chapter is concerned with how we might use these laws to inform our lives. There are certainly principles that I will take away and remember, but I can't help but believe that I will still be amazed and think about fate the next time I am presented with a \u201ccoincidence\u201d or rare event.\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

It forms a matrix that surrounds cells and is essential for the integrity of the cytoplasmic membrane. Many of our most successful antibiotics target PG synthesis. The synthetic pathway involves the assembly of sugar building blocks on a lipid carrier at the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane. The reactions that produce this so-called lipid II precursor and the enzymes that catalyze them have been known for decades. However, the identity of the flippase enzyme that \u201cflips\u201d lipid II in the membrane to expose the sugar building blocks on the cell surface for polymerization has remained highly controversial. Sham et al. now show that the essential protein MurJ is the long sought-after flippase responsible for the translocation of lipid-linked cell wall precursors across the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane (see the Perspective by Young). The work completes the cell wall biogenesis pathway and defines the function of an attractive target for new antibiotics.\n\nScience , this issue p. [220][1]; see also p.

        "abstract": "![Figure][1] \n\nFrom intergovernmental panels to corporate boardrooms, sustainability increasingly appears on the agenda. Accumulating evidence indicates humans now perturb global processes that underpin Earth's natural systems ([ 1 ][2]). The impetus to develop sustainable production and consumption systems is thus stronger today than ever before.\n\nIn The Upcycle , William McDonough and Michael Braungart focus on the importance of design in creating a world in which \u201cthings get better for generations in the future, not worse.\u201d The book builds on the authors' earlier work, Cradle to Cradle ([ 2 ][3]). There they argued for design that seeks to transform the technosphere (encompassing \u201cmetals, plastics, and other materials not continuously created by the biosphere\u201d) to mimic biological nutrient cycles: used products become inputs to other processes or food for living organisms. For example, rather than chopping down trees to use the wood directly for fuel, McDonough and Braungart propose a longer life cycle. Wood could instead be used first to build a table, which could subsequently be recycled to produce particleboard, paper, or insulation pulp. Finally, after exhausting alternative uses, the material could be burned to produce the same energy that would have been provided by the original wood. Reuse cycles should avoid using toxic chemicals that would preclude subsequent processing.\n\nAfter 11 years of implementing cradle-to-cradle concepts, McDonough and Braungart aim to inform readers about what they have learned. They also introduce the concept of upcycling: products should not only be designed to avoid negative impacts but should create positive impacts. Changing the prevailing design philosophy from \u201cplanned obsolescence\u201d toward upcycling will require a fundamental shift, not only by designers but within society more broadly. The authors propose several strategies for triggering that shift. These include an appeal to always keep in mind the question \u201cwhat's next?\u201d\u2014what will happen to the product after use? The authors walk through countless examples of what they regard as insufficient attempts at upcycling, and they describe common traps in thinking that have impeded progress. They also highlight some successful efforts, such as the trend from sewage treatment plants to nutrient management systems that recover phosphate for soil fertilizer.\n\nIn the book's foreword, Bill Clinton praises the authors for their optimism, but at times I found that frustrating. In the authors' telling, sometimes the transition toward upcycling sounds too easy and the solutions obvious. However, organizational and policy changes\u2014especially in the realm of sustainability\u2014are rarely straightforward, and the acceptable trade-offs among competing environmental, social, and economic objectives are ultimately a matter of societal judgment. The case studies could be improved by elaborating the concrete steps that were followed to implement the upcycling philosophy from concept into practice\u2014from the roles of individual champions to changes in organizational structures, policies, and processes. Readers would also benefit from learning about practical tools and frameworks that have facilitated consideration of competing objectives.\n\nQuibbles aside, McDonough and Braungart's approachable language will appeal to a wide audience. The Upcycle should prove a rich lode of ideas to inspire innovations in sustainable design across diverse applications.\n\n1.  [\u21b5][4]1.

As climate warming causes increasing amounts of that permafrost to melt, release of carbon as methane or carbon dioxide (CO2) may cause additional, rapid warming. However, it is likely that at least some of the carbon made available by permafrost melting will be used by the vegetation that is appearing in warming regions, but how large a sink that may be is unknown.

        "abstract": "![Figure][1] \n\nOver the past several decades, the international humanitarian aid organization Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders, hereinafter MSF) has been widely discussed in books on public health and international relations. In Doctors Without Borders: Humanitarian Quests, Impossible Dreams of Medecins Sans Frontieres , Renee C. Fox forgoes the traditional narrative of these books, which tend to focus on individual physicians and patients, in favor of discussing the most distinctive features of its organizational culture. She supplements the prose with a collection of photographs and illustrations.\n\n![Figure][1] \n\nPHOTO: ISOPIX/REX FEATURES/AP PHOTOS\n\nFox, a medical sociologist by training, has conducted participant observation within MSF for almost 20 years. From an insider-outsider perspective, she stresses that the core principles of MSF\u2014medical ethics, impartiality and neutrality, independence, bearing witness, and internal accountability\u2014have been internalized into the organizational culture.\n\nShe begins by analyzing the firsthand accounts (e.g., field blogs and notes) of MSF staff. In addition to being a powerful way to bear witness, the field blogs reveal a commitment to continuous reevaluation of what motivates staff to serve in MSF as they grapple with limitations that impair their ability to relieve suffering and save lives. \u201cWe do everything possible for each individual patient,\u201d reads one blog post. \u201cI had to hold back tears, though, when I realized that \u2018everything possible\u2019 is likely not going to be enough in the long run.\u201d\n\nIn the following pages, Fox chronicles the salient events of a number of debates that have occurred within MSF in recent years, which she frames as reflections of the organization's commitment to internal accountability and nonhierarchy. One of these debates occurred at the \u201cLa Mancha\u201d conference in Luxembourg in 2006, so called because of the region's association with the fictional adventurer Don Quixote, whose idealism led to \u201cmisperceptions and imperfections\u201d\u2014a theme that resonated with the conference's goal of critical self-evaluation. The debate focused on the underrepresentation of \u201cnational staff\u201d\u2014those working on MSF projects in their native countries\u2014within the organization's leadership. A contingent of MSF members argued that the creation of more non-Western branches would help the organization realize medicine \u201cwithout borders.\u201d As a result of the discussions at La Mancha, the International Council established MSF South Africa as a delegate office in 2009, and discussions are under way regarding new branch offices in mainland China.\n\nMSF's commitment to participatory democracy has at times impaired decision-making within the organization, a phenomenon that was satirized at the meeting by former MSF Head of Mission Samuel Hanryon. Fox describes a cartoon drawn by Hanryon, which depicts a group of MSF members in a fistfight. The overhead caption reads: \u201cDo we agree to disagree publicly? Yes, we agree!\u201d\n\nNext, Fox examines MSF's responses to the epidemics of HIV/AIDS in South Africa and tuberculosis in Russia and the role that partnerships (or the lack thereof) played in each case. Until the late 20th century, MSF primarily operated as an independent organization, but it became clear that partnerships with both public and private entities would become necessary if the organization hoped to tackle chronic epidemics. Fox describes an example of a successful collaboration, known as the MSF Khayelitsha program. Established in April 2000, MSF Khayelitsha consists of HIV/AIDS clinics in three community health centers in South Africa. This program was made possible by partnerships with national and local governments and the Brazilian pharmaceutical company Farmanguinhos. In contrast, without the endorsement of the Russian Ministry of Health, MSF was ultimately forced to terminate a program for Russian prisoners with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.\n\nNot all partnerships are embraced by MSF, however. Citing incidents in Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq, Fox discusses the controversy surrounding military-humanitarian coalitions. Not surprisingly, most MSF members consider military partnerships to be \u201cincompatible with true humanitarian ideals\u201d and fear that they jeopardize the MSF commitment to independence from political influence.\n\nThough not covered in the book, MSF staff are actively engaged in combating the current Ebola epidemic in West Africa, having cared for more than two-thirds of the reported cases in this region ([ 1 ][2]). This situation could require the organization to achieve a timely consensus on how to reallocate resources from longer-term initiatives. Although the provisional 2014 budget for MSF's Ebola response in West Africa has reached \u20ac51 million ([ 2 ][3]), more aid funding could be needed, as it is estimated that between 550,000 and 1.4 million people in Africa could be infected by January 2015 ([ 3 ][4]).\n\nCarefully researched and delightfully written, Doctors Without Borders establishes a new bar for those who would cover Medecins Sans Frontieres in the future. This book will take its due place as one of the most comprehensive works on MSF.\n\n1.  [\u21b5][5]1.   M.

Hirner et al. have devised a catalyst that formally cleaves B-O bonds through their intramolecular addition across an alkyne. Reasoning that direct insertion of a metal into the bond would face too high an energy barrier, the authors implemented a dual activation strategy, targeting a mechanism in which gold coordination enhances the reactivity of the C-C triple bond while trifluoroacetate coordination to B stimulates transfer of the adjacent O group. The protocol furnished a diverse array of benzofuran products with a B substituent conveniently poised for further reactivity via Suzuki coupling or other elaborations.

Neither a hagiography of early 21st-century startup culture nor a manifesto for 21st-century science, the book offers a wide-ranging review of converging technological, cultural, and even theological developments in the United States at the turn of the 20th century. Lest we put too much stock in bromides about the recent flatness of the world, this history contextualizes the developments that created a vastly more interconnected social world more than a century ago.\n\n![Figure][1] \n\nPHOTO: UNDERWOOD & UNDERWOOD/CORBIS\n\nCassedy argues that 19th-century Americans increasingly lived within interconnected networks that offered both promise and constraint. These not only included transportation and telecommunication systems that we recognize today as complex sociotechnical assemblies; Cassedy also identifies more subtle changes that embedded individuals within networks of interacting biological elements, complex technical standards, and sweeping new social ideas. He holds that the conveniences of modernity have cost us a loss of individual autonomy as we have become embedded in ever more pervasive networks. Although the book offers an anthology of rich and diverse case studies, few social scientists will be surprised by Cassedy's conclusion that social structures such as networks simultaneously enable and constrain individual agency.\n\nThe first of the book's sections, \u201cBody and Mind,\u201d considers how scientific and medical advancements led to a popular reimagination of the self as networks of interconnected cells, the mind became a network of both physical neurons and psychological desires, and the public health movement made one responsible for the health of others. Cassedy then discusses the \u201cnew physical world\u201d composed of individuals networked through standardized time, houses networked through municipal infrastructures, and consumers networked through globalized supply chains. The final section, \u201cThe Secular, Ecumenical Collective,\u201d covers individuals networked by their genes to new transnational racial concepts, by their religion to care for collective justice rather than individual salvation, and by the state through new regulations and national identities. Throughout, Cassedy narrates each episode using books, lectures, and newspapers of the era while sprinkling in literary Easter eggs and surprising historical coincidences. These texts reflect the popular consensus among scholars, journalists, and activists of the time, who viewed their social world as increasingly resembling a network, organism, or other evocative analogy of interconnected complex systems migrating out from contemporaries' scientific discoveries and technological advancements.\n\nAlthough the concept of networks should be foundational to the book's argument, there is little for network scientists to digest here. Cassedy offers perfunctory definitions in the preface and alludes to terms such as nodes, links, and hubs throughout, but his concept of networks implies a ubiquitous and homogeneous connectivity rather than the complex structures observed in social networks. There are no references to social network theories, nor does the book provide historical network data or integrate biological relationships, technical infrastructures, and group associations into something more than a paradox of autonomy. Somewhat ironically, the book never connects to social network theory's pedigrees from turn-of-the century sociology, psychology, and graph theory ([ 1 ][2]). And the author's account would have been strengthened had he tapped the rich scholarship on the networked nature of contemporary life [e.g., ([ 2 ][3])] and historical studies that illuminate the emergence and influence of what we now term social networks in political alliances and trade [e.g., ([ 3 ][4], [ 4 ][5])].\n\nDespite its faults, Connected shines in the chapter \u201cThe Network of Spatialized Time.\u201d Whereas textbooks teach that standardized time arose from the need for railroads to coordinate schedules, Cassedy identifies additional factors such as political demands for reform in response to railroads' horrific safety records, technological changes that allowed mass-produced mobile timepieces, and the needs for coordinating social and economic life: \u201cThe pocket watch links you through your jeweler, through the synchronized clocks in your place of business, through the clock above the Broadway entrance to Macy's\u2026, to the Naval Observatory in Washington. \u2026 [Time] spoke through the millions of [watches], linking the individual owners of these devices with one another.\u201d This remarkable accomplishment serves as an important benchmark against which we should evaluate the effectiveness of contemporary mobile devices at providing affordable, widely available, and accurate products for coordinating our social lives. While Cassedy's book unfortunately does not connect to social network concepts or contemporary networked aspirations and anxieties, it may prove a useful source of succinct social histories about our highly networked ancestors.\n\n1.

The climate system can be highly nonlinear, meaning that small changes in one part can lead to much larger changes elsewhere. This type of behavior is especially evident during transitions from glacial to interglacial conditions, when climate is affected by a wide variety of time-varying influences and is relatively unstable. Praetorius and Mix present a record of North Pacific climate over the past 18,000 years. When the climates of the more local high-latitude Pacific and Atlantic sectors varied in parallel, large, abrupt climate fluctuations occurred on a more global scale.\n\nScience , this issue p.

I presented a list of recommendations that included increased research funding, greater resources for education, and specific emission reduction technologies. In almost every case, a majority of the audience felt comfortable arguing for them. The only clear exceptions were related to geo-engineering research and nuclear power. I had queried the researchers because the relationship between science and advocacy is marked by many assumptions and little clarity. This despite the fact that the basic question of how scientists can be responsible advocates on issues related to their expertise has been discussed for decades most notably in the case of climate change by the late Stephen Schneider.",

        "abstract": "When I am asked how I became a developmental biologist, I say, \u201cJim hired me for my rhubarb pie and my Phi Beta Kappa key, and the rest is history.\u201d I did not set out to become a scientist. I majored in history as an undergraduate\u2014at Pomona College in Claremont, California, class of 1963\u2014then bailed on graduate school and became an elementary school teacher in a vain effort to calm a boyfriend's jealousy. (He feared competition from my graduate school classmates.) A few years later, I married my high school crush and put him through college and medical school by teaching fifth grade. His medical practice under way and our younger child in kindergarten, I began to think about going back to work\u2014but back to what? I was burned out on public school teaching.\n\nMy daughter had become friends with the daughter of a professor in the biology department at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, near where we live. Our two families had frequent potluck dinners, and Jim\u2014the biologist\u2014came to be fond of my rhubarb pies. He concluded, I guess, that I knew how to follow a recipe and probably had enough brains to follow one written in metric units, because he offered me a job as a technician in his lab.\n\n![Figure][1] \n\n\u201cIt was indeed a lot like baking pies.\u201d \n\nILLUSTRATION: ROBERT NEUBECKER\n\nWhen I first started working, I had no training in biology except what I had picked up by reading my husband's textbooks while he was in college and medical school. If asked, I would probably have answered that a molar solution is something used to rinse your back teeth. In Jim's lab, I learned to make primary cultures of Drosophila embryos, run Northern gels, and extract polytene chromosomes. (This was the 1980s.) It was indeed a lot like baking pies: If you carefully followed the recipe\u2014the protocol\u2014your experiment would likely work, although the data might not tell you what you were hoping to hear. I took my first biology course: genetics. I got a B.\n\nA perk of being a Wesleyan employee is that you get to take courses for free, so I gradually filled the holes in my scientific education. Over the years, I've taken 17 biology courses, if you count organic chemistry, and I now have three Wesleyan graduate degrees, two in biology and one in science journalism.\n\nI've thought once or twice about getting a Ph.D., but I haven't done it. I guess I just don't want my boss's job. Principal investigators (PIs) slave away, teaching and writing grants, and the data come to them secondhand. For me, the fun part is doing the experiments!\n\nWhen Jim closed his lab, I moved upstairs to another cell biology lab, using mouse cells instead of Drosophila . I have stayed in Laura's lab for more than 20 years, doing embryonic stem cell culture, preparing cells for transplant into mouse brains, and immunostaining. Sometimes my job is to be skeptic-in-chief, and sometimes I'm the head troubleshooter. I read the literature, train students\u2014graduate and undergraduate\u2014and try to make sense of it all.\n\nBeing an academic research technician is not a very profitable career\u2014not, at least, at a small private university. In 2005, I left the university to work for a biotechnology company in Massachusetts and was paid twice as much. That biotech company may cure macular degeneration someday\u2014I hope they do because I got stock options\u2014but what I really want to do is find stuff out. So, after 3 years, I returned to Laura's lab for another few years of sometimes exasperating but always engrossing basic research.\n\nMy name is on many of the papers that have come out of the lab. I'm seldom the first author and never the last, but along with the students, I am always the first to see the data, and when they have something important to say, I'm often the first to recognize it. You might say that Laura and I have a symbiotic relationship: I need a PI to lead and fund the lab, and she needs me to run it.\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

Exactly how intercellular mechanical tension is sensed at the molecular level is unknown. One attractive hypothesis is that a linkage between the cell-cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin, its binding partners \u03b1- and \u03b2-catenin, and actin filaments may act as a tension sensor. However, how this linkage is established at the molecular level is not known. Buckley et al. used optical tweezers to determine how mechanical load influences interactions of the cadherin/catenin complex with single actin filaments. The data support a model in which force shifts the interaction from a force-independent, weakly bound state to a highly force-sensitive, strongly bound state. The findings may explain how cells maintain tissue integrity while still being able to move and change shape.\n\nScience , this issue [10.1126/science.1254211][1]\n\n [1]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.1254211",

In graduate school, every student writes her own book, and sometimes there is no equation to follow.

My goal was to engineer cardiac valve tissue for patients who need valve replacement surgery.

        "abstract": "![Figure][1] \n\n![Figure][1] \n\nPHOTO: MEDIAPHOTOS/ISTOCKPHOTO\n\nWith the advent of reality television and the popularity of science-themed shows and museum exhibits, it is becoming increasingly common for the general public to observe things that used to be reserved for trained members of specific professions: surgeries, crime scene investigations, and the like. However, even for people accustomed to the relatively gory images and seemingly realistic procedures they see on television, the new book by pathologist Judy Melinek and writer T. J. Mitchell may come as somewhat of a shock. This book, entitled Working Stiff: Two Years, 262 Bodies, and the Making of a Medical Examiner , purports to bring the audience into the real world of a medical examiner, as opposed to the polished and sanitized Hollywood version. This is not a story for the faint of heart, and the reader may find it gut-wrenching in some sections and heartbreaking in others.\n\nThe book begins during Melinek's time as a surgery resident, overworked and terrified that she will make a fatal mistake in her sleep-deprived state. Ultimately, she switches career paths, leaving her surgery residency for one in pathology, where the work hours are more manageable and the patients will \u201cstill be dead tomorrow.\u201d Melinek goes on to complete a fellowship in forensic pathology at the medical examiner's office in New York City.\n\nIn a large urban setting such as New York City, there is never a shortage of work for a medical examiner, and every day there are autopsies to be done. Death by natural causes, accidents, suicide, and murder are each given a chapter in the book, gradually progressing from the relatively benign to the increasingly macabre.\n\nIn addition to her role as a pathologist, we learn that Melinek also serves as part of the forensic investigation team and is often the first point of contact for bereaved relatives. The latter role becomes especially poignant when we learn of the tragic suicide of Melinek's father, a psychiatrist. At times, the reader feels as though the elder Melinek's ghost is watching over her as she counsels the families of the deceased.\n\nThere is more to this book than the regular life of a medical examiner, however. As it happens, Melinek began her fellowship in New York City in the summer of 2001, so she was there to witness one of the darkest chapters in the city's history. The bodies of the almost 3000 people killed in the 9/11 terrorist attacks all had to be processed by the medical examiner's office. Unsurprisingly, the chapter devoted to these events is the longest one in the book and also the most difficult to read. The authors talk about the challenge of identifying victims of whom only small fragments had been recovered. In these cases, Melinek recorded what little details were available\u2014a rim of lavender toenail polish, a gold tooth, an engraved wedding ring\u2014which, together with DNA analysis, would be used to determine each victim's identity. The most compelling part of this chapter is the palpable sense of horror and despair felt by those handling the victims' remains.\n\nOverall, this book admirably accomplishes its goal, showing the reader what it's really like to be a medical examiner. Whether this is something that you can handle is up to you to decide.\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

With two words, Jane Hawking, portrayed by Felicity Jones, brings a moment of levity to a film that might easily have sunk under the weight of its own serious subject matter. Instead, The Theory of Everything , directed by James Marsh, masterfully weaves moments of humor and happiness throughout the dramatized retelling of the early life of renowned cosmologist Stephen Hawking.\n\nDespite receiving a devastating diagnosis\u2014motor neuron disease\u2014at the age of 21, Stephen Hawking married Jane Wilde in the summer of 1965. Yet even as his health was rapidly deteriorating, his fame as a physicist was growing. The film gives equal consideration to the effects these factors had on the couple.\n\nIn a subtle performance, actor Eddie Redmayne conveys an almost palpable frustration as the progression of Stephen's affliction gradually makes everyday tasks difficult and then impossible. Not to be overshadowed, Jones's Jane is at once full of quiet grace and steely resolve.\n\nHawking has confirmed the general accuracy of the story, which is based on Jane's 2007 memoir ([ 1 ][2]), reportedly describing it as \u201cbroadly true\u201d ([ 2 ][3]). In a more tacit endorsement, the film also features Hawking's own computer-generated voice.\n\nAlthough the film only briefly touches on Hawking's many illustrious scientific contributions, it does a delightful job of introducing his complex theories to a lay audience. A potato and a pea, for example, become the framework for explaining quantum physics, while the properties of a black hole are illustrated with a beer poured on a pub table.\n\nIn a poignant homage to Hawking's contributions to our understanding of time, the film closes with a sweeping montage of scenes from the relationship's early days, as the couple, now divorced, reflects on their life together. In the end, we are left with a unique and intimate portrait of the personal struggles that accompanied Hawking's meteoric rise in the field of theoretical physics.\n\n1.  [\u21b5][4] 1.   J.

        "abstract": "Heat and sand. A restrictive culture. Saudi Arabia didn't seem to have much to offer compared with other countries I had visited. So, after decades spent happily working in laboratories, how did I end up in the Saudi desert, trying to do science at a petrochemical plant? My long career with a developer of petrochemical processing technology began as a research chemist at its main research center near Chicago, Illinois. It was\u2014is\u2014a very fine laboratory. We were able to turn out accurate results quickly. An array of pilot plants ran smoothly, cranking out data 24/7. Complex experiments were designed, and definitive conclusions were drawn efficiently.\n\n![Figure][1] \n\n\u201cThings that are easy in the research lab \u2026 are hard in the field.\u201d \n\nILLUSTRATION: ROBERT NEUBECKER\n\nIn time I took on a new role, helping develop collaborations with other companies in the United States and abroad. This was a fundamental shift for me: While I was still deeply involved in solving scientific problems, there was a new focus on building relationships. Then, a few years ago, someone got the bright idea that I should join a technical team to diagnose and solve performance problems at a customer's propane dehydrogenation facility, which my company had designed, while the plant remained up and running. It was a formidable challenge, and a lot was on the line.\n\nIn some ways, I was not an obvious choice. I knew little about the technology. I had never worked in the field, in a production unit. No one cared. Those encouraging me to join the team praised my \u201cvast expertise and experience.\u201d They said my \u201cfresh eyes\u201d would be a benefit to the team. I fell for the flattery and signed on.\n\nAfter a crash review of the technology, I embarked on the first of three 2-week site visits to Al Jubail on the Persian Gulf coast. Major culture shock. All women there wear full burqas; no faces are seen and no interaction permitted, so you are cut off from half of society. Everything is forced to close during prayer times. Inappropriate dress, even by men, results in a public reprimand from a local cop. I had been to Muslim countries before, but this was far more intense. It was jarring and isolating but also fascinating. And it was HOT.\n\nYou'd think that removing two little hydrogen atoms from propane to make propylene would be simple. It is not. Propane wants to keep them. The dehydrogenation facility is big and incredibly complicated: huge, hot catalytic reactors, multiple gas separation towers, gas purification units, and cooling systems, together covering four city blocks. It's loud and scary, and a lot different from the state-of-the-art laboratory I was used to.\n\nI knew going in that to succeed I must build respectful, somewhat personal, working relationships with the local staff. Pretending to know everything (or anything) would be a bad idea; it's much better to ask questions and dig for answers together. Cultural sensitivity was crucial. My first visit, during the fasting month of Ramadan, required some particularly difficult adaptations: If you must eat or drink water during the day, please be discrete.\n\nThings that are easy in the research lab, I learned, are hard in the field. Reliable data are crucial in any investigation, but much harder to obtain in an operational industrial facility. A research pilot plant designed for liters per day is way different than a facility producing hundreds of tons per day. There is much you cannot do: You can't take samples from just any point in the process, or change operating conditions just to see what happens. Staff members may lack the experience necessary to avoid subtle problems in sampling and analysis. Data are often so uncertain, so clouded by events, that interpretation becomes more art than science, or impossible. I organized a series of conference calls with our analytical experts back home, reviewing and improving procedures alongside local staff. We made progress and improved relationships.\n\nWhen troubleshooting complex systems\u2014systems that encompass not just science and technology but also people and relationships\u2014there may be many culprits. By addressing root causes of disparate problems, our team made important improvements. And I learned plenty.\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

        "abstract": "Many factors influence success in a science career. Hard work, ambition, flair, and luck played a role in the success of Tim Hunt, who won a share of the 2001 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine (along with Leland Hartwell and Paul Nurse) for his discovery of cyclins, key regulators of the cell cycle. We caught up with Hunt\u2014now a group leader emeritus at the Clare Hall Laboratories of Cancer Research UK's London Research Institute\u2014during Postdoc Day at the Institute for Research in Biomedicine. Hunt's career demonstrates the importance of two additional success factors: playfulness and early independence. This interview was edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nQ: After a Ph.D. at the University of Cambridge, you did a postdoc at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. How did it go from there? \n\n![Figure][1] \n\n\u201cYou must somehow get independent when you are really young, and take responsibility.\u201d\n\nILLUSTRATION: ROBERT NEUBECKER\n\nA: After a year, the boss went to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] to set up a new medical school, so it was just me and a technician\u2014Grace Vanderhoff\u2014and we made things up as we went. I usually had two projects going, one with Grace during the day and my own projects, which I did at night. Gradually, the night projects started to go better than the day projects. They allowed me to discover two very important things, which both came through collaborations.\n\nAfter that, I returned to Cambridge to work in the Department of Biochemistry. And this is another thing that I think was very lucky: I had an independent fellowship from Clare College. I took a fivefold cut in pay, but I found myself among friends, namely Richard Jackson and Tony Hunter. It was a loose federation of graduate students and postdocs, and we could just do whatever we liked. This was terribly satisfactory, and we had a really lovely time.\n\nWe were a bit anarchic and bumbling in a way, and I sometimes regretted that I never had any proper, formal biochemical education. We had to work everything out for ourselves. I find myself reacting badly to this idea that there are skill sets you need to have, and you must pass exams to get them. I would rather emphasize the importance of playfulness and of making your own mistakes.\n\nQ: You stood by your results when they were controversial. This takes a lot of self-confidence. \n\nA: You have to be very sure of yourself, it's true, but you're sure of yourself because you know the experiments are robust. I always tell people, \u201cBe your own harshest critic because then nobody can hurt you.\u201d\n\nQ: Can young scientists nowadays work as independent postdocs? \n\nA: I think so. There are still lots of fellowships around, so it depends on the environment you find yourself in. You must somehow get independent when you are really young, and take responsibility. In general, however, a conventional principal investigator position takes people out of the lab just when they get really good at doing and designing experiments, and that's a shame.\n\nQ: What was the key to your success? \n\nA: Identifying a good problem to work on. That's the most difficult thing. I also think that, in my case, behind it all was a fairly steely ambition. It's perfectly healthy to want to win a Nobel Prize. I didn't have this ambition exactly, but I thought, \u201cWhy wouldn't you want to find out the most important thing you possibly could?\u201d In Cambridge, we were surrounded by Nobel laureates. We never felt that we were in the same league as these Sangers, Cricks, and Brenners, but you realized that even if they were Nobel laureates, you knew stuff they didn't, and you also realized what an amazingly heterogeneous bunch they are.\n\nWhen people ask me, \u201cWhat is the secret to success?\u201d I always say, \u201cKeep your eyes on the horizon but your feet on the ground, and preferably your nose to the grindstone.\u201d In other words, you have to work.\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

        "abstract": "Ultrafast Dynamics\nAt about 70\u00b0C, the material vanadium dioxide (VO2) switches from being a semiconductor to a metal. The switch happens so fast that it may be useful in electronic devices, but it is not clear whether the switch is primarily caused by enhanced interactions between electrons or by a change in the crystal structure. Morrison et al. shone laser light on a sample of VO2, initially in a semiconducting state. They used electron diffraction to monitor the changes in the material's crystal structure and simultaneously measured its optical properties to monitor the electronic state. For certain laser powers, VO2 switched to a long-lived metallic state even though it preserved its initial crystal structure.\n\nScience , this issue p.

        "abstract": "[Special section on HIV][1]\n\nIf Alistair Coia lived in any of Australia's poorer neighboring countries, he likely would not have seen his 50th birthday. But he celebrated it on 17 March this year, in a spacious hospital room, decorated with large balloons that his friends brought to mark the big five-zero. He is staying at a wing of the Alfred, Melbourne's venerable public hospital, specifically designed for AIDS patients. Called Fairfield House, it has 15 private rooms, each opening to a courtyard with a manicured garden; a kitchen where family and friends can cook meals with patients; and\u2014most important\u2014world-class, multidisciplinary care.\n\nCoia needed it.\n\nHe checked in 1 month earlier with late-stage AIDS. His CD4 count, a measure of how much HIV had damaged his immune system, showed just 49 of these critical lymphocytes per microliter of blood. (Normal is 600 to 1200.) He had a life-threatening case of Pneumocystis pneumonia and severe exhaustion that kept him in bed 20 hours a day. \u201cI got myself into a bit of a rut,\u201d says Coia, a former keyboardist for Kids in the Kitchen, a rock \u2018n\u2019 roll band that rode the new wave craze in the 1980s. \u201cI feel brilliant now: 2014 will be the year I recover.\u201d\n\n![Figure][2] \n\nThe Bali NGO Gaya Dewata distributes condoms outside gay bars in Seminyak.\n\nPHOTO: MALCOLM LINTON\n\nBut now, this state-of-the-art AIDS ward may be closing\u2014not because of lack of funding or political opposition, but because AIDS simply isn't a big problem in Melbourne anymore: Only six of Fairfield House's 15 beds are typically in use. Australia has had one of the most effective responses to HIV in the world. Since 1983, when the country had its first AIDS case, there have been fewer than 35,000 documented infections with HIV and fewer than 8000 deaths. The United States, in contrast, has 50,000 new infections and some 15,000 deaths each year. Yes, Australia has only 23 million people. But the country still has nearly fourfold fewer infections and sixfold fewer deaths per capita.\n\nOne reason is the country's universal health care, which provides access to the latest antiretroviral drugs. Another is the response that began soon after HIV arrived in Australia. Affected communities teamed up with clinicians and academics to pressure the government to promote prevention campaigns that targeted the most vulnerable populations. A harm reduction movement that became a model for the region (see p. [156][3]) offers clean needles and syringes to people who inject drugs, as well as opiate substitutes like methadone that do not require needles. Provocative, blunt advertising campaigns spoke directly to gay men about the importance of using condoms, which were widely distributed for free. Several states legalized sex work. HIV/AIDS researchers joined international studies of experimental treatments and helped determine how best to use them. Basic researchers provided key insights into the interaction between the virus and the immune system, and today, they are a driving force behind efforts to find a cure for HIV/AIDS. \u201cWe've had really good public health policies that are upheld and valued,\u201d says virologist Sharon Lewin, a leading HIV cure researcher who heads the infectious disease department at the Alfred and who is co-chair of the 20th International AIDS Conference, which will take place in Melbourne 20 to 25 July.\n\n![Figure][2] \n\nAIDS inpatients like Insio Henson ( left ) are still common in Papua New Guinea, but cases like Alistair Coia ( far right ), with HIV researcher Sharon Lewin, are a rarity in Australia.\n\nPHOTOS: MALCOLM LINTON (2)\n\nGiven its success on the homefront, Australia has become a major exporter of HIV/AIDS research advances, as well as strategies to curb the epidemic. This spring, Science visited Australia and three of its neighbors who have benefited: Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, and Malaysia.\n\nAdeeba Kamarulzaman, arguably the most productive and influential HIV/AIDS researcher in Malaysia, completed both her undergraduate and medical degrees in Melbourne (see p. [164][4]). The minister of health in Indonesia, Nafsiah Mboi, brought in Australian experts to persuade her country's top officials to support harm reduction efforts (see p. [162][5]). Public health workers in Papua New Guinea work closely with scientists at the Kirby Institute for Infection and Immunity in Society, a branch of the University of New South Wales based in Sydney, on prevention efforts as well as basic research and surveillance to clarify how HIV is spreading through the island's remotely connected communities (see pp. [158][6], [160][7], and [161][8]). \u201cAustralians have been boxing above their weight in the regional response,\u201d says epidemiologist Chris Beyrer of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nCultures, geographies, economies, and governments shape AIDS epidemics, and each country faces unique challenges in trying to slow viral spread and help the infected. Indonesia has more infected people than any other country in Asia and the Pacific, except India and China. Papua New Guinea has an unusually large heterosexual epidemic for the region, while Malaysia is grappling with a startling rise in prevalence in men who have sex with men. Even Australia has seen a modest, but steady, rise in new infections (see p. [157][9]).\n\nIn all four countries, turning knowledge into action is easier said than done. But the stakes could not be higher now that research has led to increasingly effective tools capable of blunting epidemics and, if forcefully applied, even bringing them to a halt.\n\nAs editorial content in this issue further explains, critical questions remain about how to develop even more effective responses against HIV. Debates over the best vaccine strategies continue (see Zolla-Pazner, p. [167][10]), while preclinical studies explore prospects for eradicating the latent viral reservoir and curing the disease (see Barouch and Deeks, p. [169][11]). Finally, researchers are grappling with how to describe the genuine progress against HIV without overselling it (see El-Sadr et al. , p. [166][12]).\n\n![Figure][2] \n\nSOURCE: UNAIDS, HIV in Asia and the Pacific (2013)/UNAIDS, Global AIDS Response Progress Reporting (2012 and 2014)/Indonesia Ministry of Health, National AIDS Spending Assessment /Papua New Guinea, CIA World Factbook\n\n [1]: http://www.sciencemag.org/site/special/hiv2014/index.xhtml\n [2]: pending:yes\n [3]: http://www.sciencemag.org/content/345/6193/156.full\n [4]: http://www.sciencemag.org/content/345/6193/164.full\n [5]: http://www.sciencemag.org/content/345/6193/162.full\n [6]: http://www.sciencemag.org/content/345/6193/158.full\n [7]: http://www.sciencemag.org/content/345/6193/160.full\n [8]: http://www.sciencemag.org/content/345/6193/161.full\n [9]: http://www.sciencemag.org/content/345/6193/157.full\n [10]: http://www.sciencemag.org/content/345/6193/167.full\n [11]: http://www.sciencemag.org/content/345/6193/169.full\n [12]: http://www.sciencemag.org/content/345/6193/166.full",

        "title": "Winter is coming",
        "abstract": "In Antarctica this week, the daylight is dimming as the polar night approaches. \u201cThe weather is pretty changing at the moment. There are a lot of low-pressure systems coming from the Weddell Sea, leading to high wind speeds up to 55 knots and a lot of snowdrift,\u201d says meteorologist Elena Stautzebach. She is part of a small team of early-career scientists overwintering at the German research base Neumayer-Station III. \u201cIn between, we have periods of sunny weather and temperatures around \u221210\u00b0C.\u201d But the darkness will be continuous starting on 28 May. It will last 56 days. Located 450 kilometers from its closest neighbor, the station has a proud meteorological history: Scientists have conducted measurements and observations there every 3 hours for more than 30 years. Many measurements run on a programmed schedule. But visual observations\u2014cloud and weather conditions, air pressure, dew-point temperature, wind speed and direction, and visibility, for example\u2014must be made by people, rather, a person. \u201cWe have just one meteorologist, who has to sleep now and then,\u201d says the team's lead off-continent contact, Gert Konig-Langlo of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Germany. This winter, that meteorologist is Stautzebach. The team operates on Coordinated Universal Time. At 9 a.m., noon, 3 p.m., 6 p.m., 9 p.m., and midnight, she is outside collecting data, whatever the weather.\n\n![Figure][1] \n\n\u201cOverwintering and being in charge of a scientific observatory in Antarctica is a challenge.\u201d\n\nILLUSTRATION: MARC ROSENTHAL\n\n\u201cAs it gets darker, it is getting more difficult to distinguish between different cloud layers and types. Observations are therefore taking a lot longer without daylight, as you have to stay outside longer in order to adapt your eyes to the darkness. But this also means that you have time to watch the beautiful stars of the Southern Hemisphere and that you have higher chances of seeing polar lights,\u201d she says.\n\nTo ensure that her measurements are accurate, Stautzebach must do daily rounds, dusting snow and breaking off ice crystals from 10 radiation sensors, two ventilated temperature sensors, two wind anemometers (one of them 10 meters above the ground), three humidity sensors, and snow depth and air pressure sensors\u2014all located 200 meters from the station to avoid wind and shadow influences. Stautzebach also climbs up on the station's roof to check the visibility sensor and the ceilometer, which detects cloud height.\n\nAs the temperature drops, Stautzebach will start to travel 20 kilometers by snowmobile every 3 weeks to Atka Bay, where she will measure the first growth of sea ice and platelet ice. As winter digs in, the ice will become strong enough to support an automated meteorological station equipped with radiation sensors.\n\n\u201cOverwintering and being in charge of a scientific observatory in Antarctica is a challenge,\u201d Stautzebach says. \u201cDuring the winter season, we have to deal with all sorts of situations on our own. Our team includes one engineer who is responsible for the functioning of the entire station, one IT-specialist who has to maintain the communication with the world outside Antarctica, and one doctor. Additionally, in case of a fire, we have to turn into our own firefighters.\u201d\n\nWinter for the team officially started at the end of February \u201cwhen the last plane left Antarctica,\u201d Stautzebach says. \u201cWe are now on our own until November.\u201d The nine-person team will then continue its work through the following Antarctic summer, helping the next overwintering team prepare for what is coming.\n\n\u201cNow that I am in Antarctica, the continent with the harshest weather conditions in the world, I can't wait to experience probably the most extreme weather in my life. Even more exciting than cold temperatures are storm events with snowdrift and whiteouts. As soon as the highest wind speeds of a storm event are reached, I often go outside with one of my colleagues (and a radio and GPS of course) in order to experience the strength of the wind.\n\n\u201cThis winter I will simply enjoy the harsh weather conditions in Antarctica, and as soon as I am back in Europe, I'll think back to storm events that I had the chance to experience down here.\u201d\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

I was nearing the end of my fourth year, and I was in a research rut I couldn't seem to escape.*A group of friends from my undergraduate days invited me to spend a late-spring weekend at a lakefront cabin. Our plans to enjoy the lake and the lengthening daylight were dashed by a cold front that came through, bringing 2 days of rain. We still managed to enjoy ourselves, though, by playing card games, making ridiculously good barbecued pork, and reminiscing. The weather changed eventually, and on our last night at the cabin, we were able to spend some time outside. We built a bonfire. One of the guys went to look for wood and came back with a butane torch. He discovered that he could melt holes in empty aluminum beverage cans. (I quickly located my cellphone in case I needed to call 911; even on weekend trips, apparently, I cannot escape my role as safety officer.) One of the guys asked if I wanted a turn, but I declined. \u201cNo thanks,\u201d I said. \u201cI get to use one of those at work.\u201d\n\n![Figure][1] \n\nWe make things. We play. And the people we work with are great.\n\nILLUSTRATION: MARC ROSENTHAL\n\nAfter a short, puzzled look, my friend replied, \u201cReally? Why?\u201d\n\nMe: Usually to make sure our glassware and sample pans are clean and dry.\n\nMy Friend: Cool. And nothing melts?\n\nMe: No, it's either glass or platinum. The metal gets all glowy. (Clearly my public-outreach vocabulary needs work.)\n\nMy Friend: What else do you get to use?\n\nThe conversation continued along those lines. I learned that my work\u2014with torches, liquid nitrogen, reagents, and a bunch of solvents and, especially, the fact that I get to make things\u2014is impressive to people who spend 40 hours a week in an office. True, they are impressed by different things than I am: To me, fluorine-19 NMR is really cool, but that one didn't rate so high with my nonscientist friends. They preferred the fact that we occasionally use liquid nitrogen to make ice cream.\n\nRefreshed from the trip, I returned to the lab and tried to convince my lab mates that, according to some people, doing science is cool because we get to use butane torches and do other interesting things. I'm not sure they were convinced, but for me the message really hit home a few weeks later, as I was reading a post at the blog Tenure, She Wrote. The post I was reading (which I highly recommend) was about the reasons why it's good to be a woman in science ( ). Number one is, \u201cWe get to do science.\u201d The writer even describes science as \u201ckick-arse.\u201d\n\nI hadn't recognized it until that reminder from my friends, but it's true: We get to do cool things, and it's not just playing with torches. Whenever I decide that my work is getting boring, I can go and learn a new technique. I'm encouraged to argue with my lab mates and my adviser, and I win praise for making things up\u2014that is, for coming up with ideas and solving problems in creative ways. We make things. We play. And the people we work with are great.\n\nShortly after my return from the cabin, I started working with two undergraduate students who were participating in a summer research experience. Having their fresh eyes and energy in the lab served as a further reminder that I had chosen an interesting and exciting career. Furthermore, the added responsibility forced me to organize my work and manage my time more effectively; I had to be sure that the undergrads' project stayed on schedule and that they always had something to do. Being a mentor while completing my own assignments raised my confidence. I escaped my rut.\n\nIt's true: Being a scientist really is \u201ckick-arse.\u201d If you ever forget that, go spend time with friends whose jobs don't allow them to make things and play with cool toys. They surely will remind you.\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

        "abstract": "DNA Biochemistry\nThe bulding blocks of DNA, deoxynucleotide triphosphates, are synthesized by the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR). Its central role in DNA synthesis and its aberrant expression in tumors have made it an important anticancer target, but nucleoside analog inhibitors of RNR can have adverse side effects. Arnaoutov and Dasso identify IRBIT (IP3-receptor-binding protein released with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate) as an RNR-binding protein. IRBIT regulates the activity of RNR by stabilizing the inactive form bound to deoxyadenosine triphosphate in the low-affinity A site. In turn, phosophorylation of IRBIT regulates its RNR-binding activity. IRBIT provides a new target for RNR inhibition that might avoid some of the side effects of current drugs.\n\nScience , this issue p. [1512][1]\n\n [1]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.1251550",

        "abstract": "Robert S. Langer, the David H. Koch Institute Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, is the most cited engineer in history, with more than 163,000 citations. He holds more than 1000 patents, licensed or sublicensed to more than 300 companies, and he has helped found at least two dozen biotechnology companies. This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\n![Figure][1] \n\n\u201cDon't sacrifice publishing good science to be secretive.\u201d\n\nILLUSTRATION: ROBERT NEUBECKER\n\nQ: Why did you become a scientist? \n\nA: In my day, there was this company called A. C. Gilbert that made these great erector, chemistry, and microscope sets. I got them for various birthdays. Later on, in high school, I was good in math and science and terrible in everything else. People would say to me, \u201cYou should become an engineer.\u201d I thought engineers ran railroad cars. I went to Cornell and majored in engineering. My first term, the only class I liked and did OK in was chemistry, so I decided I would be a chemical engineer.\n\nWhen I graduated with my doctorate in 1974, the standard chemical engineering job was to work at an oil company. I wasn't excited about that. So I kept looking for things I felt would make an impact, that would help people. I ended up working as a postdoc with Judah Folkman, a surgeon at Boston Children's Hospital. He had this idea that if you could stop blood vessels, maybe that would be a way to stop cancer. I thought, \u201cBoy, this is a lot better than oil companies.\u201d If it worked, it would be incredible.\n\nQ: How did you go from scientist to entrepreneur? \n\nA: My project was to isolate the first angiogenesis inhibitors. We invented microparticles that release an inhibitor of blood vessel growth to starve the growing tumors. I thought, \u201cWe'll publish our work on microparticles, and everybody will use them clinically.\u201d And then nobody did. Nobody used them to help people. So we patented them and licensed them. After about 10 years, somebody called me. They were going to work with the microspheres we developed, but they did only an experiment or two a year. I was frustrated. About a year later, Alex Klibanov, a professor at MIT, said, \u201cBob, we should start a company.\u201d\n\nQ: What, in your view, is the most common mistake scientists make when trying to launch a company? \n\nA: Starting too early. It is a long road in the medical area. If you start up too early, you may have trouble getting investment. Even if you succeed, then by the time you get to clinical trials, the investors may get tired.\n\nQ: What is the connection between graduate science education and entrepreneurship? \n\nA: When you're a student, you're judged by how well you answer questions. But in life, you're judged by how good your questions are. You want students and postdocs to transition from giving good answers to asking good questions. Then they'll become great professors, great entrepreneurs, great something.\n\nWhen somebody is a student or postdoc, what is going to help them through is to be stretched. Feeling some of that discomfort, knowing how to get through it\u2014the fact that you can prove to yourself that you can get through, and you can do well\u2014that is wonderful, as long as it is not too painful.\n\nQ: How do you advise scientists to approach their careers? \n\nA: I always tell people, \u201cJust follow your heart. Pick something you think you are going to love.\u201d To me, that is the most important thing.\n\nQ: What is your take-home message to budding scientist-entrepreneurs? \n\nA: Do great science. Don't sacrifice publishing good science to be secretive. Then go to the next step and patent it\u2014and do licensing and start companies. That can be incredibly fulfilling because it gives you the opportunity to take your ideas\u2014and give your students the opportunities to take their ideas along with you\u2014and create things that could change the world and make it a better place.\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

        "abstract": "In his 11 April Letter \u201cImmunotherapy: It takes a village\u201d (p. [149][1]), D. Pardoll recognized some of the scientists and research that led to the discovery highlighted as Science 's 2013 Breakthrough of the Year: cancer immunotherapy. Online commenters pointed out additional factors worthy of recognition. An excerpt from those comments is below. Read the full comments at  .\n\nA selection of your thoughts: \n\nThe Letter by D. Pardoll pays tribute to the basic science and its primary contributors behind breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy. A major aspect of the breakthrough is the approach of blocking co-inhibitory receptors\u2026. Pardoll's Letter leaves one asking, when was the \u201ceureka\u201d moment when immunologists understood that peripheral tolerance was not simply a consequence of AgR signals, the previous paradigm, but instead due to such co-inhibitory signals? \u2026Nicholas R. StC. Sinclair did experiments that led him to publish in 1971 the model that B cells are made tolerant not by AgR engagement but instead co-engagement of AgR with a hypothesized receptor for the Fc portion of IgG on the B cell. The B cell FcR receptor was later discovered by others and was shown in tremendous cellular and molecular detail to be a co-inhibitory receptor\u2026. [B]etween 1990 and 1993, Sinclair proposed that these co-inhibitory receptors underlie negative feedback regulation of T cells and not just B cells, a conceptualization driven by his quite radical view at the time that the AgR transmits positive rather than negative signals; hence the need for other signals to shut down lymphocytes. One wonders how such breakthroughs in understanding could have received so little attention. It raises broader questions of what we value in basic science. If we are to do our best to justify funding of basic science, we must ensure that the stories of such eureka moments illuminating a general principle in biology are told.\n\n [1]: http://www.sciencemag.org/content/344/6180/149.1.full",
