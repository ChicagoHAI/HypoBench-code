We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. Replication effects were half the magnitude of original effects, representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had statistically significant results. Thirty-six percent of replications had statistically significant results; 47% of original effect sizes were in the 95% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.",

To unravel the genomic determinants of response to this therapy, we used whole-exome sequencing of non\u2013small cell lung cancers treated with pembrolizumab, an antibody targeting programmed cell death-1 (PD-1). In two independent cohorts, higher nonsynonymous mutation burden in tumors was associated with improved objective response, durable clinical benefit, and progression-free survival. Efficacy also correlated with the molecular smoking signature, higher neoantigen burden, and DNA repair pathway mutations; each factor was also associated with mutation burden. In one responder, neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses paralleled tumor regression, suggesting that anti\u2013PD-1 therapy enhances neoantigen-specific T cell reactivity.

        "abstract": "Background The integration of graphene in photovoltaic modules, fuel cells, batteries, supercapacitors, and devices for hydrogen generation offers opportunities to tackle challenges driven by the increasing global energy demand. Graphene\u2019s two-dimensional (2D) nature leads to a theoretical surface-to-mass ratio of ~2600 m 2 /g, which combined with its high electrical conductivity and flexibility, gives it the potential to store electric charge, ions, or hydrogen. Other 2D crystals, such as transition metal chalcogenides (TMDs) and transition metal oxides, are also promising and are now gaining increasing attention for energy applications. The advantage of using such 2D crystals is linked to the possibility of creating and designing layered artificial structures with \u201con-demand\u201d properties by means of spin-on processes, or layer-by-layer assembly. This approach exploits the availability of materials with metallic, semiconducting, and insulating properties. Advances The success of graphene and related materials (GRMs) for energy applications crucially depends on the development and optimization of production methods. High-volume liquid-phase exfoliation is being developed for a wide variety of layered materials. This technique is being optimized to control the flake size and to increase the edge-to-surface ratio, which is crucial for optimizing electrode performance in fuel cells and batteries. Micro- or nanocrystal or flake edge control can also be achieved through chemical synthesis. This is an ideal route for functionalization, in order to improve storage capacity. Large-area growth via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has been demonstrated, producing material with high structural and electronic quality for the preparation of transparent conducting electrodes for displays and touch-screens, and is being evaluated for photovoltaic applications. CVD growth of other multicomponent layered materials is less mature and needs further development. Although many transfer techniques have been developed successfully, further improvement of high-volume manufacturing and transfer processes for multilayered heterostructures is needed. In this context, layer-by-layer assembly may enable the realization of devices with on-demand properties for targeted applications, such as photovoltaic devices in which photon absorption in TMDs is combined with charge transport in graphene. Outlook Substantial progress has been made on the preparation of GRMs at the laboratory level. However, cost-effective production of GRMs on an industrial scale is needed to create the future energy value chain. Applications that could benefit the most from GRMs include flexible electronics, batteries with efficient anodes and cathodes, supercapacitors with high energy density, and solar cells. The realization of GRMs with specific transport and insulating properties on demand is an important goal. Additional energy applications of GRMs comprise water splitting and hydrogen production. As an example, the edges of MoS 2 single layers can oxidize fuels\u2014such as hydrogen, methanol, and ethanol\u2014in fuel cells, and GRM membranes can be used in fuel cells to improve proton exchange. Functionalized graphene can be exploited for water splitting and hydrogen production. Flexible and wearable devices and membranes incorporating GRMs can also generate electricity from motion, as well as from water and gas flows. Tailored GRMs for energy applications. The ability to produce GRMs with desired specific properties paves the way to their integration in a variety of energy devices. Solution processing and chemical vapor deposition are the ideal means to produce thin films that can be used as electrodes in energy devices (such as solar panels, batteries, fuel cells, or in hydrogen storage). Chemical synthesis is an attractive route to produce \u201cactive\u201d elements in solar cell or thermoelectric devices.",

We identify the many-body localization transition through the relaxation dynamics of an initially-prepared charge density wave. For sufficiently weak disorder the time evolution appears ergodic and thermalizing, erasing all remnants of the initial order. In contrast, above a critical disorder strength a significant portion of the initial ordering persists, thereby serving as an effective order parameter for localization. The stationary density wave order and the critical disorder value show a distinctive dependence on the interaction strength, in agreement with numerical simulations. We connect this dependence to the ubiquitous logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy characterizing the generic many-body localized phase.",

Dense dislocation arrays formed at low-energy grain boundaries by liquid-phase compaction in Bi(0.5)Sb(1.5)Te3 (bismuth antimony telluride) effectively scatter midfrequency phonons, leading to a substantially lower lattice thermal conductivity. Full-spectrum phonon scattering with minimal charge-carrier scattering dramatically improved the zT to 1.86 \u00b1 0.15 at 320 kelvin (K).

The level of the amino acid leucine tells an organism a lot about its physiological state, including how much food is available, how much insulin is going to be needed, and whether new muscle mass can be made (see the Perspective by Buel and Blenis). Wolfson et al. identified a biochemical sensor of leucine, Sestrin2, which connects the concentration of leucine to the control of organismal metabolism and growth. When leucine bound to Sestrin2, it was released from a complex with the mTORC1 regulatory factor GATOR2, activating the mTORC1 complex.

We identified thousands of somatic SNVs by single-cell sequencing of 36 neurons from the cerebral cortex of three normal individuals. Unlike germline and cancer SNVs, which are often caused by errors in DNA replication, neuronal mutations appear to reflect damage during active transcription. Somatic mutations create nested lineage trees, allowing them to be dated relative to developmental landmarks and revealing a polyclonal architecture of the human cerebral cortex. Thus, somatic mutations in the brain represent a durable and ongoing record of neuronal life history, from development through postmitotic function.",

Normally, GATA4 is degraded by p62-mediated selective autophagy, but this regulation is suppressed during senescence, thereby stabilizing GATA4. GATA4 in turn activates the transcription factor NF-\u03baB to initiate the SASP and facilitate senescence. GATA4 activation depends on the DNA damage response regulators ATM and ATR, but not on p53 or p16(INK4a).

Inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, but exactly how is not fully understood. Warnatsch et al. now show that immune cells called neutrophils release NETs (neutrophil extracellular traps) (see the Perspective by Nahrendorf and Swirski). These NETs are composed of DNA and antimicrobial proteins, and in the setting of atherosclerosis they activate innate immune signaling pathways in macrophages. This causes the macrophages to secrete proinflammatory cytokines, exacerbating the disease. Indirectly, NETS also attract a specialized subset of T cells that further amplify the proinflammatory response. Science , this issue p. 316 ; see also p. 237",

High-rate injection wells (>300,000 barrels per month) are much more likely to be associated with earthquakes than lower-rate wells. At the scale of our study, a well's cumulative injected volume, monthly wellhead pressure, depth, and proximity to crystalline basement do not strongly correlate with earthquake association.

Thus, ILCs are maintained by self-renewal in broadly different microenvironments and physiological settings.

This chronic mPFC overactivity also stably suppresses natural reward-motivated behaviors and induces specific new brainwide functional interactions, which predict the degree of anhedonia in individuals.

An important player in this silencing process is the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which methylates histone H3 on lysine residue 27 (H3K27me). Jiao and Liu determined the x-ray crystal structure of a functional PRC2 complex from a thermophilic yeast species (see the Perspective by Schapira). The intimate association of the three subunits confers stability to PRC2. The structure also reveals how the reaction product, H3K27me, stimulates PRC2 allosterically and how a cancer-associated histone mutation blocks the PRC2 active site.

Here, we report the three-dimensional structure of a Schizosaccharomyces pombe spliceosome at 3.6-angstrom resolution, revealed by means of single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy. This spliceosome contains U2 and U5 snRNPs, NTC, NTR, U6 small nuclear RNA, and an RNA intron lariat. The atomic model includes 10,574 amino acids from 37 proteins and four RNA molecules, with a combined molecular mass of approximately 1.3 megadaltons. Spp42 (Prp8 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae), the key protein component of the U5 snRNP, forms a central scaffold and anchors the catalytic center. Both the morphology and the placement of protein components appear to have evolved to facilitate the dynamic process of pre-mRNA splicing.

Our findings illuminate the unusual transverse spin in evanescent waves and explain recent experiments demonstrating the transverse spin-direction locking in the excitation of surface optical modes.

Targeting the human Nav1.7 channel involved in pain perception, we present a protein-engineering strategy that has allowed us to determine crystal structures of a novel receptor site in complex with isoform-selective antagonists. GX-936 and related inhibitors bind to the activated state of voltage-sensor domain IV (VSD4), where their anionic aryl sulfonamide warhead engages the fourth arginine gating charge on the S4 helix. By opposing VSD4 deactivation, these compounds inhibit Nav1.7 through a voltage-sensor trapping mechanism, likely by stabilizing inactivated states of the channel. Residues from the S2 and S3 helices are key determinants of isoform selectivity, and bound phospholipids implicate the membrane as a modulator of channel function and pharmacology.

        "abstract": "Mechanical strain regulates the development, organization, and function of multicellular tissues, but mechanisms linking mechanical strain and cell-cell junction proteins to cellular responses are poorly understood. Here, we showed that mechanical strain applied to quiescent epithelial cells induced rapid cell cycle reentry, mediated by independent nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity of first Yap1 and then \u03b2-catenin. Inhibition of Yap1- and \u03b2-catenin-mediated transcription blocked cell cycle reentry and progression through G1 into S phase, respectively. Maintenance of quiescence, Yap1 nuclear exclusion, and \u03b2-catenin transcriptional responses to mechanical strain required E-cadherin extracellular engagement. Thus, activation of Yap1 and \u03b2-catenin may represent a master regulator of mechanical strain-induced cell proliferation, and cadherins provide signaling centers required for cellular responses to externally applied force.",

Here we show that cardiac microtissues engineered from human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells are a powerful system for evaluating the pathogenicity of titin gene variants. We found that certain missense mutations, like TTNtvs, diminish contractile performance and are pathogenic. By combining functional analyses with RNA sequencing, we explain why truncations in the A-band domain of TTN cause DCM, whereas truncations in the I band are better tolerated. Finally, we demonstrate that mutant titin protein in iPS cell-derived cardiomyocytes results in sarcomere insufficiency, impaired responses to mechanical and \u03b2-adrenergic stress, and attenuated growth factor and cell signaling activation. Our findings indicate that titin mutations cause DCM by disrupting critical linkages between sarcomerogenesis and adaptive remodeling.",

Cardiac-specific ablation of Yme1l in mice activated OMA1 and accelerated OPA1 proteolysis, which triggered mitochondrial fragmentation and altered cardiac metabolism. This caused dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Cardiac function and mitochondrial morphology were rescued by Oma1 deletion, which prevented OPA1 cleavage. Feeding mice a high-fat diet or ablating Yme1l in skeletal muscle restored cardiac metabolism and preserved heart function without suppressing mitochondrial fragmentation.

        "abstract": "When we first met, we did not sound like natural collaborators: a biologist who had recently arrived from a pharmacy group in the United Kingdom and a materials scientist from a nanomaterials group in Germany. But we had a couple of things in common: We were both postdocs in a nanoparticle lab at CIC biomaGUNE, a biomaterials institute in the Basque Country in Spain, and we were both interested in expanding our horizons and growing beyond our disciplinary training. So, while the odds of us doing any productive work together seemed low at first, we were ultimately able to overcome the struggles and achieve a happy partnership, conducting truly interdisciplinary research.\n\n![Figure][1] \n\nILLUSTRATION: ROBERT NEUBECKER\n\n> \u201cBut then we tried an often overlooked strategy: Share an office!\u201d \n\nFor our collaboration to blossom, we've had to bridge cultural, intellectual, and practical differences. In one of our projects, we have been working to quantify how well cells take up nanoparticles with different coatings. To a materials scientist, spending weeks to prepare hundreds of samples just for cells to eat them can be frustrating. Meanwhile, to a biologist, materials scientists tend to have unrealistic expectations\u2014for example, that cells will efficiently endocytose whatever they are fed, without taking into account the fact that they are living things and thus do not always behave as we would like.\n\nSeveral other mismatches between our fields cropped up. Materials scientists tend to focus on characterizing the material used in the experiment, while biologists primarily want to investigate how the material affects the cells. Planning biology experiments can be very complex; having to respect the life cycle of the cells or organisms can create challenges when collaborators are not used to working with this type of imposed schedule. Materials scientists are also generally expected to publish papers more quickly than biologists are, and biologists place more emphasis on clinical applications than materials scientists do. These differences can make it difficult to agree about when work is ready for publication.\n\nIn the beginning, our progress was slow. We quickly reached high levels of frustration, even despair, despite our initial excitement about the projects we planned to tackle. It didn't help that we were also at a delicate point in our careers: the stage when most researchers\u2014ourselves included\u2014start searching for tenure-track positions. Investing most of our efforts into a multidisciplinary collaboration that might not work, and would likely not be completed quickly, was a risky strategy for standing out in the crowd.\n\nBut then we tried an often overlooked strategy: Share an office! We soon discovered that we both appreciate the uniqueness of the Basque Country. Our science conversations became interlaced with Basque language tips, suggestions of which mountain to climb over a weekend, and, of course, detailed discussions of the local food and drink. We got to know each other better, and talking about science became easier. We could trade quick suggestions and advice. We could also plan our time better, coordinating experiments and maximizing resources. Our science took a new turn, and the secrets of the interface between biology and materials science seemed to be unfolding. Within a month of sharing an office, we were finally making progress in one of our projects, developing a cell culturing substrate that can release cells or tissues in response to a light source.\n\nSo there you have it. Working closely with scientists from different backgrounds and listening to their scientific views can deepen your understanding of other fields\u2014and improve your own research. We have never enjoyed our respective fields as much as we do right now, which we have achieved by stepping out of them. We encourage scientists interested in interdisciplinary research to get to know not only the work of colleagues but also the colleagues themselves; a huge field of scientific and personal joy is out there to explore.\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

Given the poor performance of government support for entrepreneurship, should the job be left to the private sector? Moving beyond the traditional public-private debate, the MIT Regional Entrepreneurship Acceleration Program (REAP) ( ) charts a new approach.\n\nREAP builds on an ecosystem framework drawing on recent research highlighting distinct, yet interdependent, roles of innovative capacity (the ability to develop new technology), entrepreneurial capacity (the ability to scale startup businesses), and the economic clusters supporting a region. Rather than focus solely on entrepreneurship (as do many government initiatives) or innovation (often focused on increased R&D investment), REAP builds on evidence that successful regions link the two to establish a comparative advantage through innovation-driven startups.\n\nMIT REAP's 2-year program brings together regional teams of entrepreneurs; risk-capital, corporate, and university leadership; and government. Although this approach is simple to describe, most regions have found it challenging to link high-level stakeholders for sustained effort (and are often surprised by the many connections that are \u201cmissing\u201d from their ecosystem). Teams undertake data-driven, regional diagnoses, including assessing strengths and weaknesses in their regional capacities, and benchmark their ecosystem using our novel methodology for measuring entrepreneurial quality through the use of business registration records and predictive analytics ([ 1 ][1]). These insights are turned into action: Teams aim to catalyze their innovation ecosystem in a measurable and sustainable way and build an organization for ongoing regional collective action.\n\nFor example, REAP Scotland is leading changes in Scotland's economic-development approach to emphasize entrepreneurial mentoring (an area that had been previously downplayed) and the development of a dynamic network for Scottish entrepreneurs and expatriates (a potential strength that had not previously been leveraged). These initiatives upgrade the region's entrepreneurial capacity in order to match its traditional strength in innovative capacity (see [www.hie.co.uk/business-support/entrepreneurship/mit-reap/][2]).\n\n1.

It means doing things in an unconventional way and considering and being open to doing things that are not just the standard way of doing things,\u201d he says. The emphasis is on working \u201coutside of the academic and industry monoculture.\u201d\n\nIn search of a clearer path, he brainstormed with his brother, a legal entrepreneur. He also \u201cturned to Twitter as a source of solace and support\u2014 and as an opportunity to learn, \u2026 what would a plan B look like?\u201d On Twitter, he commiserated with others who were struggling in the academic market and connected with rare-disease advocates. He found people he could bounce ideas off as he wrestled with his next career move. \u201cI really feel like [Twitter] made my transition possible,\u201d he says.\n\nOver the course of about a year, his new venture took shape: Perlstein Lab\u2014PLab for short\u2014a for-profit, public-benefit corporation that aims to develop treatments for rare diseases. In 2014 he incorporated, brought in $2.2 million in investments, and hired three Ph.D. scientists and a few other research staff. PLab is currently targeting two diseases, Niemann-Pick Type C and NGLY1 deficiency. Using genetic models in a variety of organisms\u2014yeast, nematodes, fruit flies, zebrafish\u2014PLab aims to identify candidate treatment compounds for each disease, which can then be refined and taken to the clinic with partner companies.\n\nPerlstein never imagined himself as a startup CEO, but now that he's doing it, \u201cI couldn't be happier,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel like we're able to blend the best of basic and applied science. \u2026 There are certain parts of academia that I miss, but the parts I miss the most I've tried to recreate here: things like journal club, happy hour, places where you can just kind of nerd out and be self-indulgent about the science.\u201d\n\nDespite now being officially corporate, he hasn't given up the indiescience spirit. In the long run, he hopes PLab will be successful enough to allow him to \u201cdo what I really wanted to do all along, which is to build a truly independent science institution.\u201d He imagines something akin to the Santa Fe Institute, where researchers can go on sabbatical, interact with new people, and engage in interdisciplinary work. \u201cBut that's kind of a long-term fantasy,\u201d he says.\n\nOne year in, PLab is not quite out of the startup woods. \u201cWe've survived the birthing process, so at least there's that,\u201d he says. \u201cWe're showing the first signs that we can stand up on our own two feet.\u201d He's optimistic about the company's future, but knows from experience that he ought to hedge his bets. \u201cThings could sour quickly,\u201d he acknowledges. Still, \u201cmaybe I'm just saying it, but I think we're in a tentatively firm position in terms of happiness, subject to contingencies.\u201d\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

        "abstract": "Despite their allegiances to 47 different nations, 87 ethnic groups, and countless football teams, Europeans have a lot in common. Most speak closely related languages that are members of the great Indo-European language family.\u00a0A new study uses ancient DNA to suggest that a massive migration of herders from the east shaped the genomes of most living Europeans\u2014and that these immigrants may have been the source of Proto-Indo-European (PIE), the mysterious ancestral tongue from which the more than 400 Indo-European languages sprang. Based on DNA gathered from dozens of ancient skeletons, the study,\u200b described last week in a preprint posted on the bioRxiv server, reveals when and where different groups of people arrived in Europe and interbred with each other. One surprise is that a migration of herders from the steppes of today9s Russia and Ukraine about 4500 years ago significantly shifted the genetic makeup of today9s Europeans. Many living Europeans retain traces of this influx, which the authors link to an ancient culture of steppe herders known as the Yamnaya.\u00a0The team behind the study further suggests that the Yamnaya people spoke either PIE or an early form of Indo-European language and brought it to central Europe, coming down on one side of a long-standing debate about the origins of PIE.\u00a0That idea is supported by a second paper published this week in Language, which uses changes in words instead of genes to claim that the steppelands were the likely homeland for the origins of many Indo-European languages. But some researchers aren9t convinced and \u200bsay the genetic \u200bdata aren9t strong enough to connect ancient people known by their DNA to any particular language.",

        "abstract": "Ten years ago, I was a professor of cell and molecular biology at Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana. I was riding high on a series of recent academic honors for my work studying toxigenic molds and was looking forward to spending a sabbatical leave at The Institute for Genomic Research, now the J. Craig Venter Institute, in Maryland. Then, in August 2005, just a few weeks before I was to leave on sabbatical, Hurricane Katrina nearly destroyed my university and my city. The storm upended my comfortable life and unexpectedly sent me down a new research trajectory.\n\n![Figure][1] \n\nILLUSTRATION: ROBERT NEUBECKER\n\n> \u201cAs I sampled my house, wearing gloves and a mask, I started to feel sick.\u201d \n\nThe weeks after Hurricane Katrina were some of the worst of my life. My family and I had safely evacuated to New Jersey, where we had friends who could house us, but our home had been flooded and our city devastated. I suffered acute insomnia, heightened by the fact that I knew too much about mold metabolism. Fungi, the life forms that had fascinated me since childhood, secrete digestive enzymes into the environment, often turning their substrates to slime, and then reabsorb the breakdown products. They are nature's great recyclers. I hated knowing that molds were recycling the contents of my waterlogged home.\n\nMore than a month after Hurricane Katrina, we flew back to New Orleans to survey the damage. When we unlocked our front door, we were greeted with fungal anarchy. Molds were growing on everything: rugs, curtains, wallpaper, upholstered furniture, and\u2014worst of all\u2014some of my most treasured books. The odor was overpowering.\n\nBefore my return to New Orleans, I figured I might salvage something from the loss of my home if I turned it into a living laboratory. I visited Jim White, a mycologist friend at Rutgers University in New Jersey, who equipped me to sample the molds in my flooded home. I traveled with a suitcase full of sterile swabs, masks, gloves, and 10 sleeves of petri dishes filled with growth media. As I sampled my house, wearing gloves and a mask, I started to feel sick. I had to take several breaks and go outside. I began to empathize with people who claimed to have gotten sick from indoor mold exposure, a controversial condition sometimes called \u201csick building syndrome.\u201d I vowed that if I ever got a functioning lab again, I would study the volatile compounds that were causing the odious smell in my house.\n\nLater that fall, Rutgers invited me to finish my sabbatical leave there. The hurricane had kept me from my original sabbatical plans, and all of the microbial cultures in my Tulane laboratory had died during the weeks without power after the storm, so it was an attractive offer. Several months later, I agreed to stay on at Rutgers as founder and associate vice president of the Office for the Promotion of Women in Science, Engineering, and Mathematics.\n\nDuring my first years at Rutgers, I worked on issues related to women in science while reinventing my research career. In my new laboratory, as I had promised myself after Hurricane Katrina, my team adapted genetic models to study the possible physiological effects of fungal volatile organic compounds (VOCs). We found that several common fungal VOCs are neurotoxic in a Drosophila (fruit fly) model. Somewhat surprisingly, we also found that the VOCs from the most common fungus isolated from my flooded home, a Trichoderma species, can make the plant Arabidopsis and tomatoes grow better. Although I haven't been able to demonstrate that the gases from molds contribute to sick building syndrome, I have been able to show that they have many profound physiological effects.\n\nI don't recommend experiencing a devastating hurricane and losing your home as a way to revitalize your research. Nevertheless, my science has kept me focused on future possibilities rather than on past losses. The Hurricane Katrina catastrophe has led me to what may be the best science that I have ever done.\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

In addition to RNA editing, additional functions have been proposed for ADAR1. To determine the specific role of RNA editing by ADAR1, we generated mice with an editing-deficient knock-in mutation (Adar1(E861A), where E861A denotes Glu(861)\u2192Ala(861)). Adar1(E861A/E861A) embryos died at ~E13.5 (embryonic day 13.5), with activated interferon and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-sensing pathways. Genome-wide analysis of the in vivo substrates of ADAR1 identified clustered hyperediting within long dsRNA stem loops within 3' untranslated regions of endogenous transcripts. Finally, embryonic death and phenotypes of Adar1(E861A/E861A) were rescued by concurrent deletion of the cytosolic sensor of dsRNA, MDA5. A-to-I editing of endogenous dsRNA is the essential function of ADAR1, preventing the activation of the cytosolic dsRNA response by endogenous transcripts.",

This one at the Sanger Institute in Hinxton, U.K., currently has 16 petabytes of DNA sequence information on file.\n\nPHOTO: GENOME RESEARCH LIMITED\n\nAs sequencing technology races toward ever cheaper, faster, and more accurate ways to read an individual's entire genome, understanding the health implications of variations in the genetic code becomes more crucial. This genetic variation can be as small as a single nucleotide base-pair change, insertion, or deletion, or as large as the gain or loss of multiple chromosomes.\n\nGenetic mutations can cause suffering and early death. It is thus vital to understand their origins and how they affect biological function. Some deleterious mutations may arise and be maintained over generations within populations. These may only come to light when an individual carries two copies, as for a recessive Mendelian trait. Others may be exposed as soon as they arise within an individual. Such mutations can cause developmental defects if they occur very early in life, or contribute to aging and disease, notably cancer, in later life.\n\nRecent technological advances have made it easier to detect human mutations and link them to pathology. Our ability to identify and target cancer-specific mutations has opened up a new and promising line of research. The rise of new genetic editing tools and a deeper understanding of the genetic architecture of traits, combined with reproductive technologies, offer the possibility to eliminate or mitigate the deleterious impact of mutations. While some mutations are easier to target than others, which can cause frustration at the pace of translating genetic information into medical help, enormous progress has arguably been made in the decade since the first human genome was decoded\u2014and there's the promise of even more clinical applications in the future.\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

        "abstract": "The hiring game starts early. Well before a faculty position even opens, department members and administrators tend to observe the available pool of candidates and shortlist the ones they consider most promising. Savvy candidates work this preselection process to their advantage. Some ways of doing this are obvious: Be an excellent scholar. Publish well. Work hard. Communicate with the public and your peers. But a well-planned, long-range effort to ensure your visibility among those who have hiring responsibilities can be the deciding factor.\n\nHere's how it worked for me. I arrived at the University of Toronto in 1982 as a postdoctoral diploma candidate in clinical biochemistry. Coming from a rather poor country\u2014Greece\u2014was a disadvantage, so I did all I could to adapt to the new environment, fill in my knowledge gaps, and make a good impression with hard work and dedication. When I finished the diploma training in 1984, the chair of the department showed interest in finding a job for me. But I had to go back to Greece first to complete my medical degree. I finished it in 1986.\n\n![Figure][1] \n\n\u201cI made myself visible by participating in every research seminar.\u201d\n\nILLUSTRATION: ROBERT NEUBECKER\n\nWhen I returned to Toronto, I was hired as the director of research and development at a small biotechnology company spun off from the university; I also had an adjunct position in clinical biochemistry at the University of Toronto. I had no special training or experience in business management, but I found myself directing eight Ph.D. scientists, working together to develop a commercial product.\n\nWorking at a company was not my first choice, but I gave it everything I had, and the work I did there laid a cornerstone for my future success. I learned to appreciate the difficulties associated with developing and commercializing a system, which we succeeded in doing toward the end of my time there. I learned how to manage people and how to keep them focused on a single task. I met with potential customers and investors and learned how to negotiate and promote products and ideas.\n\nThe job was good and challenging, but it was not what I was aiming for in the long term. Meanwhile, a new chair had taken over in the department, and I set out to persuade him to hire me as an academic clinician-scientist.\n\nI worked 16 to 17 hours a day, not just to make progress on the technology but also to publish our results in high-impact journals. How did I manage it? My wife\u2014also a Ph.D. scientist\u2014worked far less than I did; she took on the bulk of the domestic responsibilities. Our children spent many Saturdays and some Sundays playing in the company lobby. We made lunch in the break room microwave.\n\nMy colleagues and I managed to publish numerous papers, and I was invited repeatedly to present at national and international conferences. I was able to demonstrate, in the department's annual report, scientific productivity comparable in quantity and quality to the full-time academics in the department. I made sure these activities were noticed.\n\nI made myself visible by participating in every research seminar\u2014not easy, considering the hour-long drive and how busy I was at the company. Each time I entered the lecture room, I made a point of passing in front of the department chair before sitting down. At the end of every seminar, I made sure to ask a carefully crafted question or two.\n\nAfter 18 months of this, the chair paid me an unexpected visit at the company and invited me to become his deputy in the department and at the teaching hospital. Ten years later, I succeeded him.\n\nOur daughter, by the way, is now a Ph.D. scientist working as a clinical chemist, and our son is in training to become an M.D.-Ph.D. neuropathologist. My wife is a senior scientist at a major teaching hospital.\n\nMaking sure you are noticed can give you the edge you need over your silent competition.\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

Today, he is assistant statistician in the input-output statistics branch of the Office of the Chief Economic Adviser in the Scottish government. In his spare time, O'Neill, who has been profoundly deaf since birth, heads a project aimed at expanding the representation of mathematical and statistical terminology in British Sign Language (BSL). This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\n![Figure][1] \n\n\u201cThe focus should be on the job and how they can do it.\u201d \n\nILLUSTRATION: ROBERT NEUBECKER\n\n> Q: What are the most important barriers for deaf students? \n\n> A:Hearing teachers have little understanding of the broad impact of deafness and how to meet the needs of deaf children. For example, deaf students often have poor access to English, so it's more difficult for them to write answers to questions. Also, the insufficient specialist vocabulary within BSL makes it difficult for deaf students (and interpreters) to learn and communicate technical details.\n\n> Q: Tell us about your efforts to expand the BSL Glossary for mathematics. \n\n> A:A friend led me to the Scottish Sensory Centre in Edinburgh. I initiated discussions geared toward expanding the signs available for mathematics and statistics, and in 2014 the center put me in charge of these efforts. We have secured funding and are about to have a workshop where deaf mathematicians and scientists will work with linguists to create signs and terms based on the national math curriculum.\n\n> Q: When you were being recruited for your current job, at what stage did you reveal your deafness? \n\n> A:On the application form, the Scottish government invited applicants to claim a guaranteed interview or assessment under the Positive About Disabled People scheme. I made the claim and was treated positively.\n\n> Q: How would you advise scientists with a disability to respond to interview questions about performing the essential functions of a job? \n\n> A:I'd advise them to do it honestly, without dwelling on their disabilities. The focus should be on the job and how they can do it. If they do things differently for any reason, that's fine as long as it's explained clearly and realistically. Interviewers will be reassured when there are positive solutions.\n> \n> It is perfectly possible to make a disability come across as a positive contribution to one's work. I have excellent visual skills due to my use of sign language, which are helpful in mathematics. When asked about communicating with colleagues, I respond that my experience with both deaf and hearing cultures\u2014the deaf community views itself positively as a linguistic and cultural minority\u2014means that I'm bilingual and bicultural. I appreciate the importance of different languages and how messages need to be targeted toward a specific audience.\n> \n> It is important to not emphasize how disabilities affect our jobs negatively. This sends false messages to employers that we are not confident in doing our jobs, and employers will often fear what they do not know.\n\n> Q: What skills can scientists bring to the workplace as a result of their disabilities? \n\n> A:We have encountered problems or barriers in the workplace due to our disabilities and found ways to remove them. As a result, we tend to have a greater understanding and awareness of problems and how to deal with them than do scientists who have no disabilities. We also view the world differently, so we can provide a different perspective on real-world problems and models.\n> \n> It is up to us to explain this clearly. We have to project confidence that we know what we are doing and talking about.\n> \n> So we have to deal with any underlying issues we have, including our own attitudes toward our disabilities. If we accept our disabilities, then we will inevitably be better equipped to go about our daily lives and work comfortably.\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

Despite the versatility of the methods and the range of materials that can be deposited, the techniques remain mostly confined to the lab because of challenges in industrial scaling. But because there is tremendous scope for fine-tuning the structure and properties of the multilayers, there is interest in broadening the use of these techniques.\n\nScience , this issue [10.1126/science.aaa2491][1]\n\n [1]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.aaa2491",

Later, after some missteps and struggles in high school, professors at Manchester Community College conspired to change my life course from high school dropout to Ph.D. holder. One of them was my first algebra teacher. On the first day of class, she wrote on the board, \u201cYou CAN do math.\u201d \u201cYou may not believe that now,\u201d she told us, \u201cbut you will by the end of this semester with me.\u201d\n\n![Figure][1] \n\nILLUSTRATION: ROBERT NEUBECKER\n\n> \u201cNone of this would have been possible without the encouragement I received.\u201d \n\nShe taught me that I could learn things even if they were hard, and that I didn't need to know them instinctively. When I transferred to the University of Connecticut for my bachelor's degree in molecular and cellular biology, this principle served me well in the 200-person introductory \u201cweed-out\u201d courses.\n\nI thought that I would be a technician at a pharmaceutical company after graduation, so I worked in various labs on campus to gain the critical hands-on experience I would need. But my career trajectory took a turn during the last semester of my undergraduate education, when my lab adviser encouraged me to consider going to graduate school for a Ph.D.\n\nI hardly even knew what grad school was, but once she opened my eyes to the possibilities, and we came up with a funding strategy, I was hooked on the idea.\n\nGetting my Ph.D. was the first step on my circuitous route toward a professional life that I could never have imagined. I did a postdoc and worked on technology transfer and in university administration before starting my own business and management consulting firm, 32ATPs. I entered the political arena with a 1-year appointment as Utah's state science adviser. In this role, I shepherded a precious allotment from the state legislature of 10 million hard-won dollars for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. I then started the R&D arm of 32ATPs and recently cofounded my second startup, EduPaper Products, where I pursue my passion of making STEM education accessible to everyone.\n\nNone of this would have been possible without the encouragement I received throughout my schooling and in my professional career. Study after study shows that, beginning in early childhood and continuing throughout college, girls are typically discouraged from entering STEM fields, and I was lucky to be an exception.\n\nI have worked to pay it forward by acting as a mentor for girls and women in STEM, passing on the advice that has worked for me:\n\nI still need advice, too. I stay in touch with many of my mentors, and I find new mentors through state- and federal-level professional services. These days, I worry just as much about giving back to my mentors as I do about learning from them, and I am honored when my grad school mentors ask me for help. Mentorship, I like to say, works up, down, and sideways.\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

Ltn1p, a ubiquitin ligase, binds near the nascent polypeptide exit tunnel on the ribosome, well placed to tag the truncated protein for destruction. The Rqc2p protein interacts with the transfer RNA binding sites on the partial ribosome and recruits alanine- and threonine-bearing tRNAs. Rqc2p then catalyzes the addition of these amino acids onto the unfinished protein, in the absence of both the fully assembled ribosome and mRNA.

Many-body interactions and the multiple degrees of freedom available to charge carriers give electronic systems a range of exotic behaviors. Susstrunk and Huber show that this extends to mechanical systems made up of a large lattice of coupled pendula. Mechanical excitations can be eliminated from the inner part of the lattice and confined to the edges, much like topological insulators.

        "abstract": "Each week, articles in Science and friends in science-related careers remind me how competitive the grant and paper scenes have gotten. One National Science Foundation (NSF) panelist, for example, recently told me that the panel's funding rate in the last competition was 3%. I don't need these reminders; my own steady diet of rejections from prospective funders and journal editors keeps the message vivid and personal.\n\n![Figure][1] \n\nSongwriting \u201chas been good for my soul as well as my science.\u201d \n\nILLUSTRATION: ROBERT NEUBECKER\n\nSo 3 years ago, when I rebooted my songwriting \u201ccareer\u201d after a 30-year hiatus, I felt battle-hardened enough to think big. Not only did I dive right into writing and recording my songs, but I became enamored with breaking into the Nashville market as a songwriter. I naively thought that my songs were at least as good as what I heard on country radio, and on my most optimistic days, I judged my tunes better than average. Certainly, I reasoned, my experience with rejection in science would steel my resolve to get my songs recorded by the latest country stars.\n\nWhat I didn't realize then was that rejection in science is nothing compared to the Fort Knox\u2013like exclusion that the Nashville fortress foists on newcomer-wannabes. I gained an appreciation for NSF: At least it reviews my grant proposals and tells me if I win or lose. The agency even gives me feedback. In contrast, the music industry is a sort of black hole where songs disappear forever. I haven't been totally unsuccessful; I've had a few cuts on small record labels. But between the minor triumphs, it's discouraging not knowing the outcome of a pitch most of the time and not hearing from publishers and producers\u2014the reviewers\u2014about how I can improve a song. Science is much kinder than the music business in this regard.\n\nPitching songs, however, has taught me a few practical lessons about pitching papers and grant proposals:\n\nYou have to tell your story in 3 minutes. If the paper or proposal (or song) doesn't grab the audience's attention pretty quickly, it won't be a hit. This is especially true for grant proposals: If the first page doesn't compel the reviewer's interest in 3 minutes, the proposal is toast.\n\nYou need a memorable hook. In a song, the hook is the phrase or melodic line that the listener hums and sings in the shower. A science story also needs a memorable hook that relays a simplified message about why a piece of science is important.\n\nKeep it fresh. Most hit songs have predictable structure but include surprises and interesting turns. Similarly, the best papers are well structured but include unexpected and novel results.\n\nDon't go solo. Although I would like to think I can do all the songwriting, playing, and singing to express a song in a pitch, for me that is almost never the right decision. Most hit songs have two or more co-writers, and the demos are played by extraordinarily fine musicians. In science, collaborators bring unique expertise and make a project stronger. Science and commercial music are both so competitive that the right team is needed to produce winners.\n\nInspiration isn't everything. Supposedly, Jimmy Buffett wrote most of \u201cMargaritaville\u201d in a few minutes, but most songs are rewritten several times. The same should be true for papers and grant proposals. When I'm reviewing proposals, it's usually obvious when the principal investigator thinks he's Jimmy Buffett. Most hits are the product of close examination and rewriting.\n\nFinally, in music, it goes without saying that the most successful songs are those that people like the most. It's less obvious in science, but it's equally true. I now pay more attention to which papers are cited most and which talks my audiences react best to. It helps to know what works and what doesn't.\n\nI don't plan to give up my day job anytime soon, but I also don't intend to give up songwriting. It has been good for my soul as well as my science.\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

HBP is an intermediate in the synthesis of lipopolysaccharide, a major component of bacterial cell walls. Rather than alerting the immune system through traditional pathogen detection pathways, such as Toll-like receptors, HBP signals through the host protein TIFA (TRAF-interacting protein with forkhead-associated domain), which activates both innate and adaptive immune responses to control the infection.\n\nScience , this issue p.

        "abstract": "\u201cNo successful postdoc has ever commuted!\u201d That was the warning from one professor when I announced that I would be moving to Providence while continuing to do postdoc research in Boston\u201480 kilometers away. I had resolved to commute because my then-boyfriend, now-husband, was beginning medical school at Brown University. We had decided early on that living apart was not for us.\n\n![Figure][1] \n\nILLUSTRATION: ROBERT NEUBECKER\n\n> \u201cMy own suggestion is to follow your own path.\u201d \n\nSeparation from loved ones during postdoctoral training is practically a rite of passage, among other sacrifices supposedly proving one's commitment to science. There is a persisting culture in academia that holds that training should be a struggle, perhaps even a hazing process; that declares that because some in the past succeeded through suffering, others must continue to do so in the future.\n\nMy own experience challenges such assumptions. For example, beware anyone who claims to have worked continuously for more than 15 hours a day, 7 days a week, in the lab. No one spends that much time in the lab throughout their training, no matter what they might tell you. During my Ph.D., I would sometimes work strenuously for a month, but then I would make sure to take a long weekend off, visiting friends, taking a complete break. Falling into this rhythm, I achieved a level of productivity that everyone involved in my training, not least myself, seemed happy with.\n\nNow that I am married, I continue to work hard, but I also have other priorities. My hours in the lab are variable; I get in, do all my lab work, and get out, doing my writing and reading at home and on my commute. I am now split between two labs, and my efficiency is improved. With a commute to deal with, I don't want to spend time in the lab procrastinating on a computer, and I've never been a fan of being in the lab all hours just to be seen there. I only stay late if I'm actually doing an experiment.\n\nThat strategy may not be heroic, but it is rational\u2014and, I am confident, not unusual. As a medical student, my husband frankly has the more realistic prospect of a job. We want to have children, and to afford to do so, we can't depend on my uncertain career prospects alone. Our status as a gay couple also enters the calculations. More than half of U.S. states provide no employment protection for LGBT workers, and a larger gray area surrounds the rights of private religious institutions to discriminate. Other aspiring scientists must contend with factors such as their race, socioeconomic status, or gender. The idea of the noble struggle for an academic position ignores such confounding variables.\n\nIn my postdoctoral work, I have focused on securing training and credentials. Beginning as a chemist who moved into biochemistry and developmental biology during my Ph.D., I discovered my love of proteins. My first postdoc was in proteomics, learning how to experiment with mass spectrometry. My second has focused on developing my understanding of cell biology, as well as learning quantitative imaging techniques. And (shock, horror) I am considering a third postdoc. I enjoy doing practical science, and, frankly, it's a convenient temporary position while my husband does his residency. Our timelines don't match perfectly; with luck, future prospective academic employers will understand that, but I have been looking into other career paths in case they don't.\n\nI've had a lot of fun so far. I've used nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometers\u2014and even a synchrotron. I've done work in the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, and in my long association with the frog Xenopus , I've discovered the joys of developmental biology and trying to combine it with my background in the dark chemical arts.\n\nI haven't made it yet, whatever \u201cit\u201d turns out to be, and everyone's secret sauce for success is different. But my own suggestion is to follow your own path by reading around widely and dipping your toe into the various pools of different activities before you throw yourself in. Enjoy what you do, strive to do it well, and have no regrets. Most of all, aim to love what you do, but don't jeopardize ties with those you love.\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

        "abstract": "As a child of mixed ancestry growing up 5 decades ago in the Harlem and Bronx neighborhoods of New York City, Erich Jarvis was immersed in the teachings of civil rights leaders. From Martin Luther King Jr., he took the precept to \u201clove everybody, accept everybody.\u201d Malcolm X inspired him to succeed \u201cby any means necessary.\u201d Both principles have served him well in science, says Jarvis, now a prominent neurobiologist. Jarvis is a natural collaborator and also an opportunist. \u201cI try to accept any kind of tool or any type of technology that I need to use to answer my questions,\u201d he says.\n\nThese days, the Duke University professor and Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator studies the molecular mechanisms underlying the capacity for spoken language, a uniquely human trait. His work was featured prominently in the 12 December Science special issue. (You can read it at [scim.ag/1v9GcNv][1].) It required an unusual collaboration with researchers studying a seemingly different topic: the evolution of birds.\n\n![Figure][2] \n\n\u201cMy mother always taught me to do something that has a positive impact on the planet.\u201d\n\nILLUSTRATION: ROBERT NEUBECKER\n\nParrots, songbirds, and hummingbirds are among the few animals capable of imitating sounds they hear, a trait called vocal learning. Jarvis wanted to compare the genomes of vocal-learning birds with their nonvocal-learning evolutionary cousins. He first teamed up with Genome 10K, a project aiming to sequence the genomes for 10,000 vertebrate species, and when he heard about another parallel bird-sequencing project, he helped bring everyone together to create a coalition. \u201cSome people say competition leads to greater advances, but I've found that coordinating, and forming collaborations and cooperating, actually works just as well if not better,\u201d he says.\n\nJarvis took an indirect route to science. A student at New York City's High School of Performing Arts, the setting for the 1980 movie Fame , he earned an audition with Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, a prestigious modern dance company. He chose science instead. \u201cMy mother always taught me to do something that has a positive impact on the planet, and I felt I could do that better as a scientist than as a dancer,\u201d he explains. \u201cScience and dance are very similar to me. They both require discipline, creativity, invention, and lots of effort that in the end rewards you with something new.\u201d\n\nHis undergraduate research at Hunter College produced six papers. \u201cA lot of people were surprised that a person of color could do this,\u201d he says. \u201cI remember people telling me that directly; they weren't shy about it.\u201d He encountered similar sentiments in graduate school at Rockefeller University, where some implied he was only there because of a quota, he says. \u201cI remember internalizing this feeling that I'm not as good as others here and that I don't belong here.\u201d\n\nWhen the time came to apply for faculty jobs, \u201cI felt like I suddenly became a commodity because of the successes I had, like I was being sought after almost like a basketball player.\u201d Yet his minority status continues to present challenges. \u201cAnything that has to do with any kind of diversity issue, I'm called upon because I'm an underrepresented minority,\u201d he says. \u201cI am expected to hold two jobs. One is to be the best scientist I can be, like anybody else, and the other is to cure society's disease. \u2026 I had to learn how to say \u2018no\u2019 to a lot of things in order for it to not take up my time and sink my science career.\u201d\n\nIt's not that he believes the issue is unimportant or solved. He says he could not have succeeded as a scientist without special programs and awards for minority researchers, \u201cno matter how much talent I had.\u201d He just wants more company\u2014more researchers from underrepresented-minority backgrounds in faculty positions in the basic sciences, where they can \u201clead by example.\u201d Science needs to be more visible as a career option, he says. \u201cIn my old neighborhoods, people haven't heard the word Ph.D. that much. \u2026 They say, \u2018What's a Ph.D.?\u2019\u201d\n\n [1]: http://scim.ag/1v9GcNv\n [2]: pending:yes",

I got the idea from a television program called 3-2-1 Contact , where I watched a young African-American girl solve problems. I saw my reflection in her and was transfixed. As time passed and my science career progressed, I saw that reflection less often. Now, years later, after a stint in industry and a negative tenure decision, I'm putting myself out there so that others can see their reflection in me. It's a precarious path, exposed and vulnerable, but so far the fruits of my journey have exceeded my fears.\n\nGreat teachers nurtured my interest in science. There was Kathleen Donahue in fifth grade, who stoked my passion. There was Jean Howard, the unflappable high school physics teacher who urged me to apply to top colleges.\n\n![Figure][1] \n\n\u201cI saw my reflection in her and was transfixed.\u201d\n\nILLUSTRATION: ROBERT NEUBECKER\n\nAt Brown University, there were Edelgard Morse, the chemistry professor who rescued me when my grades fell, and also Anne Fausto-Sterling\u2014my learned mentor, professor, and North Star. With a strong sense of purpose, a hungry mind, and a willingness to work hard, I assumed my success was assured. It wasn't; I could easily have been one of the many nameless casualties science routinely sheds. Weary and battle worn, I made it through.\n\nI continued on to Stanford University to seek a Ph.D. As the only black student in the materials science department, I felt lonely and lost. But two good things happened there: I was awarded a AAAS Mass Media Fellowship and spent a summer writing for Time . (AAAS is the publisher of Science .) And I taught an introductory materials science class at a local community college. I was smitten with science communication. My students were smitten with science. I learned that I loved teaching science and that I have a talent for reaching apprehensive students. There was a third good thing: I finished my degree.\n\nI took a research position at Bell Labs. There, I was in constant contact with other minority scientists. I saw my reflection again. My creativity flourished. I was awarded a spot on MIT Technology Review 's Innovators Under 35 list. I wanted to stay forever, but the telecom bubble burst, and my job ended.\n\nSo I landed in a tenure-track faculty position at Yale University. I established a well-funded lab, earned top teaching scores, and maintained a respected research program. I hosted a fun lecture series for kids called Science Saturdays . Children loved it and I did, too. In fact, I loved it more than I loved my research. Faculty life was not ideal\u2014I could not see my reflection in my colleagues\u2014but it was workable and I hoped to stay. Fate, and the tenure committee, had other plans.\n\nThe denial of tenure thrusts you into a caste of the unclean. You're expected to pick up your book bag, your lumbar pillow, and your shredded dignity and sneak meekly out the back door. By the time I left, I was happy to go. My gut told me it could take no more, that academic science wasn't my path. I was ill, fatigued, and uninterested in climbing that ladder again.\n\nI used the tenure decision as an opportunity to explore afresh what I should do with my \u201cone wild and precious life,\u201d as Mary Oliver called it in her poem, The Summer Day . It was time for me to discover my true vocation, which Aristotle supposedly said could be found at the intersection of the world's needs and my passions.\n\nBy now, I knew my passions well enough: science, teaching, sharing my love for science. So I looked at the world's needs and figured out my vocation. In the time I had left at Yale, I produced some science videos and posted them on YouTube. It felt good. Things opened up. TED invited me to give a talk. Dignitaries invited me to meetings. Random House published my book.\n\nI'm now happier and healthier. I'm following a path worn by Isaac Asimov, Carl Sagan, Neil deGrasse Tyson, and Bill Nye: lecturing, writing, and publicizing science. My new vocation offers less security than the old one did, but that seems fitting somehow. It's wilder and more precious.\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

ALTOUNIAN/ SCIENCE \n\nThe dream of cheating death has evolved into a scientific quest to extend healthy life span. Scientists and doctors are looking for ways to maximize the number of years that we live free of chronic diseases, cancer, and cognitive decline. But before we can intervene, we have to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive aging and senescence. Some clues reside in our telomeres, the tips of our chromosomes that shrink with age. Others lie in our stem cells, which can only go on for so long repairing our tissues. Our mitochondria, too, the so-called powerhouses of the cell, may hold some answers to prolonging youthfulness. Other research points to changes in the gut microbiota associated with frailty in the aged. At a mechanistic level, the modulation of coenzyme NAD+ usage or production can prolong both health span and life span. Current geroscience initiatives aim to harness basic insights in aging research to promote general advances in healthy aging.\n\nQuestions remain throughout the aging field. By tweaking everything from genes to diets to environmental temperature and mating, scientists have created Methuselah flies and other remarkably long-lived animals while garnering fundamental insights into the biology of aging. Still, researchers puzzle over the most basic questions, such as what determines the life spans of animals. Meanwhile, a handful of molecular biologists are searching for ways to measure a person's biological, as opposed to chronological, age, but that quest, too, has proved elusive.\n\nAn ever-growing literature addresses both theoretical and pragmatic approaches to the challenge of aging. In this special issue, we have focused mainly on the cellular aspects of mammalian aging, with the goal of spurring future developments in promoting health span, if not life span.\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

Dahl hopes the program will foster a strong ecosystem for inventors as well as inspire a new generation of them.\n\n\u201cAll of us have an inventor inside of us,\u201d said Lisa Seacat DeLuca, the most prolific female inventor in IBM history. But the inventing path is often full of hurdles. Juan Gilbert of the University of Florida has been developing a universally accessible voting system.

Rebecca Richards-Kortum of Rice University described her lab's efforts to develop a cheaper bubble CPAP, a device used to help premature babies breathe. Her group's machine is now used in health facilities in Malawi and other developing countries. \u201cI'll never forget the first time I saw a baby who went on treatment with a device that had been developed by our team,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was really an amazing moment to see how much that baby just relaxed\u2026but even better was to see the relief on his mother's face.\u201d\n\nInspiration for these inventions came from sources as varied as hanging chads and sick infants. But getting from idea to invention can be a challenge. \u201cIf you see things that other people don't, they generally think you're crazy,\u201d said Andrew Hessel of Autodesk, Inc. and the Pink Army Cooperative.

Gaupp-Berghausen et al. addressed this by testing the effects of a commonly used glyphosphate-containing herbicide on two species of earthworms in a greenhouse experiment.

        "abstract": "Sarah Teichmann's work on how cells regulate gene expression and build protein complexes recently won her a European Molecular Biology Organization Gold Medal. At 40, Teichmann holds a joint appointment with the European Bioinformatics Institute and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Hinxton, U.K. She leads a systems biology group of 17 researchers that uses both computational methods and lab experimentation. Science Careers asked Teichmann how she combines the two approaches. This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nQ: What came first, informatics or biology? \n\nA: Biology, but informatics has always been at the heart of my research. I felt inspired by computational biology when, as an undergraduate, I read a 1992 commentary by Cyrus Chothia where he made a simple calculation of the likely number of protein families. I felt excited about discovering general principles in biology and became convinced that computational biology would provide the necessary tools.\n\nBy the time I started looking for a Ph.D. in the mid-1990s, data sets had become large enough to gain a global view of the protein structure universe and of protein and gene sequences. So I went to work with Chothia at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, exploring protein families and the domain organization of proteins in the first completely sequenced genomes.\n\n![Figure][1] \n\nILLUSTRATION: ROBERT NEUBECKER\n\n> \u201cWhat unifies both wet and dry work is the conceptual part of the science.\u201d \n\nQ: Was computational biology a risky career choice? \n\nA: Yes. But I never looked back, even though at one point I came to feel that computational biology and bioinformatics were viewed as eccentric and unorthodox. My Ph.D. mentor exuded such unwavering optimism and confidence, however, that it made his lab a great place to work. Altogether, during my Ph.D., I published 10 papers.\n\nQ: What are the pros and cons of combining computational and experimental approaches? \n\nA: The beauty of a \u201cwet-dry\u201d group is that you have the ability to interpret your own experimental data computationally and to test computational predictions experimentally. The challenge, however, is maintaining the right balance and harnessing the potential of both sides of the group.\n\nQ: How did you learn these two approaches? \n\nA: During my first degree in the natural sciences at the University of Cambridge, I took math, physics, chemistry, and biology at a high level. I built on this through short courses and learning by doing. Today, I'd recommend more structured courses in algorithms and programming.\n\nQ: How do you feel about experimental work? \n\nA: I discovered early on that my fine motor skills are not up to some of the very tricky handling needed to be a top experimentalist in molecular biology. I have huge respect and gratitude for people who generate data through wet-lab experiments. What unifies both wet and dry work is the conceptual part of the science, which has to be logical and original, and both require exceptional dedication.\n\nQ: Is there anything you wish you had done differently? \n\nA: I made career choices mostly based on the package and colleagues I would have. In retrospect, it is also important to consider questions such as whether the scientific strategy and values of an institute are aligned with your own. I've also learned to shed my introverted nature and appreciate how important it is to talk to people often and openly.\n\nQ: Has it been hard to maintain a good work-life balance? \n\nA: Yes. I have two young daughters, and I believe that our society is a long way from empowering both men and women to balance their professional and family lives. There should be financial and cultural support for both men and women to work shorter hours for several months after the birth of an infant. Ultimately, fair and equal treatment would decrease unconscious bias in all of us.\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

        "abstract": "I grew up in the New York suburbs, a world of small lawns and scattered parks, but I spent most of my summers in rural upstate New York, roaming the woods. The creatures I found there fascinated me, so I went to college to study biology. One summer, I spent 2 weeks at a field station\u2014Great Gull Island in Long Island Sound, off the coast of Connecticut\u2014banding terns. My time there planted the seed that matured into a rewarding career and, ultimately, took me back to the woods.\n\n![Figure][1] \n\n\u201cI lived in the rainforest and woke to the sound of howler monkeys.\u201d \n\nILLUSTRATION: ROBERT NEUBECKER\n\nGreat Gull Island is owned by the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH). It's a former military base used mainly to study the common and roseate terns that nest there every summer. It isn't far offshore, but to me it felt remote. The boat came twice a week, on Fridays to bring food and weekend visitors and on Sundays to take the weekenders home. The buildings were old, with no electricity or running water. I didn't care.\n\nAfter graduating from college, I drifted a while, then returned to New York and took a waitressing job. I wanted to get back to biology, so I volunteered at AMNH. Great Gull Island was normally used only during summer, but I learned about a fall project studying bird migration along the Atlantic coast. I quit my job and returned to the island.\n\nDuring the day, I removed birds from mist nets and banded and released them. At night, I played cards with the other staff members by candlelight. I watched the seasons change. Every evening at dusk, a snowy owl emerged from the old gun emplacement where it hunkered down during the day and flew off over the ocean.\n\nI enrolled in a master's degree program at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. While I was there, I took a semester off to work at another field station, on Barro Colorado Island in Panama, a former hilltop that was marooned when the Panama Canal flooded the area. I lived in the rainforest and woke to the sound of howler monkeys. I spent days watching lizards and recording their behavior. Once, I returned to my room at the end of the day and found it invaded by army ants.\n\nI moved to Cornell University for a Ph.D. studying interactions between herbivorous insects and host plants. Then came a search for faculty positions, which led me to a teaching post at a liberal arts college. What I enjoyed most about that work, I found, was taking students outside: getting them on snowshoes, sending them out to catch grasshoppers, taking them canoeing. But full-time teaching had never been my dream, and when I saw an ad for a field station job, I applied.\n\nNow I'm manager of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Field Station in Saukville, Wisconsin. I've been here 15 years. It's the perfect job. I have a research program. I teach and advise. I facilitate research projects and support the teachers who bring classes here. I participate in the management of the land, at the field station and other university-owned areas: a regionally significant wetland, a virgin prairie remnant, an abandoned iron mine that's an important site for hibernating bats.\n\nMy work is structured by seasons. As the snow melts, I track bud break and leaf development. In summer and fall, I administer workshops on topics ranging from creative writing to sedge and grass identification. Winter means hikes on the frozen wetlands that, at nearly 900 hectares, are a large part of the property. I've surveyed rare orchids and an endangered dragonfly, participated in prescribed burns at our prairie site, and taken students to watch through night vision telescopes as bats exit from our hibernaculum. I've watched sandhill cranes court outside my office window and seen them later shepherding their growing chicks.\n\nExperiences like these aren't just scientific; they're natural, and human. I've found a career that allows me to have such experiences and also share them with others. I like to think I'm helping inspire the next generation of students, as I was inspired by my own field station visits years ago.\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

This interview was edited for brevity and clarity.\n\n> Q: What do you enjoy about science? \n\n> A:Science is my hobby as well as my profession. It is enormous fun. Just like every child, when I was young, I was very curious about everything around me. Fortunately, I managed to avoid having that knocked out of me while I was at school, and to this day, I take advantage of my curiosity to explore the life around me. As a result, I think about new things or make discoveries every day.\n\n![Figure][1] \n\n\u201cI think about new things or make discoveries every day.\u201d \n\nILLUSTRATION: ROBERT NEUBECKER\n\n> Q: What traits make a successful scientist? \n\n> A:A dogged persistence to solve any problem that comes along. An appreciation that many experiments fail, especially when working in a new field or in areas where we know rather little. I like it when experiments fail repeatedly because it usually means our basic hypothesis\u2014and hence the axioms on which it is based\u2014is wrong and nature is trying to tell us something. A discovery is waiting to be made.\n> \n> Good scientists are always open to new hypotheses and experimental opportunities. Often, a new technique applied to an old problem will reveal new features that were not predicted\u2014again an opportunity to make a discovery.\n> \n> Successful scientists will also constantly be on the lookout for good problems to solve. They tend to be skeptical of explanations that seem too simplistic or not well supported by evidence.\n\n> Q: How did you move to an independent position? \n\n> A:During my postdoc at Harvard in Jack Strominger's laboratory, I worked fairly independently but with excellent support when I needed it. This made it fairly easy to transition to an official independent position at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.\n\n> Q: What is the right time to transition to independence? \n\n> A:As soon as possible. Researchers are easily at their most creative when they are young, because they have no fear. This makes it much easier to challenge dogma and take risks\u2014both essential features of the creative process.\n\n> Q: Have you experienced self-doubt? \n\n> A:I think most scientists have self-doubt from time to time, but in general, the better ones have very little of it\u2014or at least they don't share it with others. I have always been fairly confident in my abilities and my views, although as I get older, I do recognize that my abilities are less than they were when I was younger.\n\n> Q: What advice would you offer to those planning a career in scientific research? \n\n> A:Find an area that you are completely passionate about and focus on it single-mindedly. That doesn't mean you can't change if something more exciting comes along, but you will be happier and more successful if you love what you do. Almost all of biology is at a stage where we know a little, but nothing like as much as we will need to if we want to say we have a good understanding of life. I think bioinformatics is a growth area and absolutely fundamental to future studies of biology. Ultimately, almost everything we need to know about life will come from bioinformatic analysis of DNA sequence. We have to vastly improve our ability to predict function from sequence.\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

During school vacations, she visited her grandparents, who lived in a village in central India. At their farm, her uncle let her take a few turns behind the tractor wheel. Later, when she was a teenager, her father, who was a pilot with the Indian Air Force, taught her how to drive a car. That was unusual in India at that time, where those who could afford a car hired a driver.\n\n![Figure][1] \n\n\u201cI am happy to be \u2026 pushing the envelope on space exploration.\u201d \n\nILLUSTRATION: ROBERT NEUBECKER\n\nToday, Verma is one of the few people in the world who is qualified to drive a vehicle on Mars.\n\nVerma majored in electrical engineering in India and came to the United States to study artificial intelligence. She was captivated by the landing of the Sojourner Mars rover in 1997 and decided to apply her engineering skill to space exploration. She pursued a Ph.D. in robotics at Carnegie Mellon University and did internships with NASA's Ames Research Center. She also got her first taste of robotic exploration here on Earth by field testing a rover that surveyed South America's Atacama Desert for signs of life.\n\nAfter graduating, in 2005, Verma joined the intelligent systems division at Ames Research Center as a research scientist. Later, she moved to NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL), the command center for the Mars rover missions. There, her robotics expertise and experience with field testing rovers won her a chance to drive the Opportunity rover. Verma drove Opportunity for 3 years before graduating to the nuclear-powered Curiosity rover, which is now prowling Mars, examining its rocks to see whether it is, or was ever, a suitable habitat for life.\n\nEach day, before the rover shuts down for the frigid martian night, it calls home, Verma says. Besides relaying scientific data and images it gathered during the day, it sends its precise coordinates. They are downloaded into simulation software Verma helped write. The software helps drivers plan the rover's route for the next day, simulating tricky maneuvers. Operators may even perform a dry run with a duplicate rover on a sandy replica of the planet's surface in JPL's Mars Yard. Then the full day's itinerary is beamed to the rover so that it can set off purposefully each dawn.\n\nFor the first 3 months after landing, from 5 August to 5 November 2012, the team was working on Mars time. \u201cI loved that we didn't have to wait long after we uplinked our commands to see the results from Curiosity, and every sol (a martian day), we were doing something we'd never done before,\u201d Verma says.\n\nCuriosity can scoop dirt, drill rock, and hand off samples to the onboard lab. While a sample is being analyzed, Curiosity is already on its way to the next site. Verma helped write the code that lets Curiosity juggle these tasks. \u201cWe have to drive on to find newer things for the slew of instruments to analyze without compromising the rover hardware or the sample,\u201d she says.\n\nShe loves her day-to-day responsibility for the machine. \u201cYou definitely don't want to be the one who drove the rover off a cliff! But I find it energizing rather than stressful. You're completely focused.\u201d\n\nBut she has not left research behind. One of Verma's key research goals has been to give rovers greater autonomy to decide on a course of action. She is now working on a software upgrade that will let Curiosity be true to its name. It will allow the rover to autonomously select interesting rocks, stopping in the middle of a long drive to take high-resolution images or analyze a rock with its laser, without any prompting from Earth.\n\nOriginally designed for a 2-year mission, Curiosity is still going strong and has already made many scientifically significant finds. \u201cWith every drive, we get to explore new terrain that no human has seen in this kind of detail,\u201d Verma says.\n\nAlthough human spacefaring has stalled, Verma says the spirit of exploration is alive and well in space robots. \u201cI am happy to be working in robotics, pushing the envelope on space exploration,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have reached Mars, our neighboring planet. We have only just begun.\u201d\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

        "abstract": "Global Warming\nGlobal warming apparently slowed, or even stopped, during the first decade of the 21st century. This pause is commonly called the \u201chiatus.\u201d We know, however, that Earth's climate system is accumulating excess solar energy owing to the build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Where, then, has this energy gone if not into the air? Nieves et al. find that over this period, the surface Pacific Ocean has cooled but the upper Indian and Southern Oceans have warmed. Thus, the decade-long hiatus that began in 2003 would appear to be the result of a redistribution of heat within the ocean, rather than a change in the whole-Earth warming rate.\n\nScience , this issue p.

A single dose of the recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus\u2013Ebola vaccine protects nonhuman primates, acting primarily through antibody responses. Marzi et al. found that this vaccine generates a robust immune response in macaques to a West African strain of Ebola virus within days of immunization (see the Perspective by Klenk and Becker). Innate immune responses developed in as little as 3 days and increased the chances of survival, with complete antibody protection acquired 7 days after immunization.\n\nScience , this issue p.
