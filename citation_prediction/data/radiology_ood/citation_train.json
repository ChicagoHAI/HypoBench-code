        "History A 46-year-old woman with known mixed connective tissue disease with clinical features of scleroderma and polymyositis and who was not on specific medications was referred to our institution to assess for interstitial lung disease due to her predisposing condition. She was a nonsmoker, had no respiratory symptoms, and enjoyed good exercise tolerance. She did not have any cutaneous lesions or renal disease. There was no family history of pulmonary or systemic disease. Her routine blood test results revealed a white blood cell count of 4.6 \u00d7 109/L (normal range, [4.4\u201310.1] \u00d7 109/L), a hemoglobin level of 7.76 mmol/L (normal range, 7.26\u20139.18 mmol/L), a platelet count of 189 \u00d7 109/L (normal range, [170\u2013380] \u00d7 109/L), a bilirubin level of 8 \u03bcmol/L (7\u201319 \u03bcmol/L), and a creatinine level of 63 \u03bcmol/L (45\u201382 \u03bcmol/L), all within normal limits. Lung function tests at presentation yielded normal results, with a diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide of 95% and a forced vital capacity of 2.29 (98% predicted value). However, this patient had an elevated serum globulin level of 47 g/L (normal range, 26\u201332 g/L) and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 36 mm/h (normal range, 0\u201320 mm/h), while C-reactive protein level was normal at less than 0.35 mg/dL. She was seropositive for antinuclear (titer >1/720), anti-Ro, anti-La, and anti-extractable nuclear antigen antibodies. Chest radiography and CT were performed at presentation (Figs 1, 2) and 14-year follow-up (Figs 3, 4). PET/CT was performed at 7- (Fig 5, A and B) and 13-year follow-up (Fig 5, C and D). Throughout this 14-year follow-up period, she remained completely free of respiratory symptoms and continued to go for a brisk walk every day. At 14-year follow-up, there was no substantial change in serum laboratory values, but a lung function test revealed her diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide had decreased to 52%, while her forced vital capacity remained good at 95%; these findings were suggestive of interval development of restrictive lung function.",
        "Purpose To determine the relationship between the presence or absence of mammographic calcifications in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancers and pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and to determine other tumor and clinical characteristics that may be predictive of such a response. Materials and Methods A database of all patients with HER2-positive breast cancer who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy between 2007 and 2015 was retrospectively reviewed. Patient demographic characteristics, mammographic appearance, molecular subtype of cancer (luminal or nonluminal), radiologic response (based on breast magnetic resonance images), surgery, and pathologic response to treatment were recorded. Inter- and subgroup comparison was performed for presence of mammographic microcalcification and cancer subtype by using Mann-Whitney and \u03c72 tests and logistic regression. Results A total of 111 patients with a median age of 49 years (interquartile range, 40\u201357 years) were evaluated. Of these, 64.9% (72 of 111) had mammographic microcalcifications, 63.1% (70 of 111) had luminal B cancer, and 36.9% (41 of 111) had nonluminal HER2-positive cancer. Radiologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was observed in 70.3% (78 of 111) of patients. Surgery was performed in 97.3% (108 of 111) of patients, and 30.6% (34 of 111) of patients underwent breast conservation. pCR was observed in 33.3% (37 of 111) of patients; 16.2% (18 of 111) showed residual ductal carcinoma in situ and 50.5% (56 of 111) had residual invasive disease. The pCR rate was the same (P = .21) in patients with mammographic microcalcification (29.2% [21 of 72]) as in those without calcification (41.0% [16 of 39]). The pCR rate in patients with nonluminal HER2-positive cancers (46.3% [19 of 41]) was higher (P = .01) than in those with luminal B cancers (25.7% [18 of 70]). pCR was associated with nonluminal HER2-positive subtype (odds ratio, 5.4; 95% confidence interval: 1.8, 16.0; P = .01) and complete radiologic response (odds ratio, 20.4; 95% confidence interval: 3.3, 126.6; P = .01). Conclusion Patients with HER2-positive cancer and mammographic microcalcification can achieve pCR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Nonluminal HER2-positive subtype and complete radiologic response are predictors of pCR. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To determine the risk of emergent dialysis and short-term mortality following intravenous iodinated contrast material exposure.This single-center retrospective study was HIPAA compliant and institutional review board approved. All contrast material-enhanced (contrast group) and unenhanced (noncontrast group) abdominal, pelvic, and thoracic computed tomography scans from 2000-2010 were identified. Patients in the contrast and noncontrast groups were compared following propensity score-based 1:1 matching to reduce intergroup selection bias. Patients with preexisting diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, or chronic or acute renal failure were identified as high-risk patient subgroups for nephrotoxicity. The effects of contrast material exposure on the rate of acute kidney injury ( AKI acute kidney injury ) (serum creatinine level \u2265 0.5 mg/dL [44.2 \u03bcmol/L] above baseline within 24-72 hours of exposure) and dialysis or death within 30 days of exposure were determined by using odds ratios ( OR odds ratio s) and covariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. Results were validated with a bootstrapped sensitivity analysis.The 1:1 matching on the basis of the propensity score yielded a cohort of 21 346 patients (10 673 in the contrast group, 10 673 in the noncontrast group). Within this cohort, the risks of AKI acute kidney injury ( OR odds ratio , 0.94; 95% confidence interval [ CI confidence interval ]: 0.83, 1.07; P = .38), emergent dialysis ( OR odds ratio , 0.96; 95% CI confidence interval : 0.54, 1.60; P = .89), and 30-day mortality (hazard ratio [ HR hazard ratio ], 0.97; 95% CI confidence interval : 0.87, 1.06; P = .45) were not significantly different between the contrast group and the noncontrast group. Although patients who developed AKI acute kidney injury had higher rates of dialysis and mortality, contrast material exposure was not an independent risk factor for either outcome for dialysis ( OR odds ratio , 0.89; 95% CI confidence interval : 0.40, 2.01; P = .78) or for mortality ( HR hazard ratio , 1.03; 95% CI confidence interval : 0.82, 1.32; P = .63), even among patients with compromised renal function or predisposing comorbidities.Intravenous contrast material administration was not associated with excess risk of AKI acute kidney injury , dialysis, or death, even among patients with comorbidities reported to predispose them to nephrotoxicity.",
        "History A 24-year-old right-handed woman presented to a neuro-ophthalmology clinic in Massachusetts in the summer with acute binocular diplopia when looking down and to the left, which started about 1 month earlier. Her medical history was notable for Raynaud syndrome, recurrent streptococcal pharyngitis, and an allergy to amoxicillin. Three days prior to developing diplopia, she presented to an outside emergency department due to fever, chills, and back pain. She received ciprofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection based on urinalysis, which demonstrated few bacteria and was negative for leukocyte esterase, nitrites, and white blood cells. She then presented again to an outside emergency department for diplopia evaluation. Initial MRI and MR angiography of the brain at that time did not demonstrate any relevant findings, and the patient was referred to our department for neuro-ophthalmic evaluation, where she was seen 4 weeks later. Neuro-ophthalmic examination revealed 20/20 visual acuity in both eyes, and a right hypertropia in left gaze, downgaze and right head tilt, with right eye excyclotorsion. There were no ocular signs of myasthenia gravis or thyroid eye disease, nor did the patient report ocular or systemic symptoms. She denied recent travel. High-spatial-resolution MRI of the brain and orbit were performed (Figs 1, 2).",
        "Although investigators in the imaging community have been active in developing and evaluating quantitative imaging biomarkers (QIBs), the development and implementation of QIBs have been hampered by the inconsistent or incorrect use of terminology or methods for technical performance and statistical concepts. Technical performance is an assessment of how a test performs in reference objects or subjects under controlled conditions. In this article, some of the relevant statistical concepts are reviewed, methods that can be used for evaluating and comparing QIBs are described, and some of the technical performance issues related to imaging biomarkers are discussed. More consistent and correct use of terminology and study design principles will improve clinical research, advance regulatory science, and foster better care for patients who undergo imaging studies.",
        "Background Chest CT is used to assess the severity of lung involvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Purpose To determine the changes in chest CT findings associated with COVID-19 from initial diagnosis until patient recovery. Materials and Methods This retrospective review included patients with real-time polymerase chain reaction\u2013confirmed COVID-19 who presented between January 12, 2020, and February 6, 2020. Patients with severe respiratory distress and/or oxygen requirement at any time during the disease course were excluded. Repeat chest CT was performed at approximately 4-day intervals. Each of the five lung lobes was visually scored on a scale of 0 to 5, with 0 indicating no involvement and 5 indicating more than 75% involvement. The total CT score was determined as the sum of lung involvement, ranging from 0 (no involvement) to 25 (maximum involvement). Results Twenty-one patients (six men and 15 women aged 25\u201363 years) with confirmed COVID-19 were evaluated. A total of 82 chest CT scans were obtained in these patients, with a mean interval (\u00b1standard deviation) of 4 days \u00b1 1 (range, 1\u20138 days). All patients were discharged after a mean hospitalization period of 17 days \u00b1 4 (range, 11\u201326 days). Maximum lung involved peaked at approximately 10 days (with a calculated total CT score of 6) from the onset of initial symptoms (R2 = 0.25, P < .001). Based on quartiles of chest CT scans from day 0 to day 26 involvement, four stages of lung CT findings were defined. CT scans obtained in stage 1 (0\u20134 days) showed ground-glass opacities (18 of 24 scans [75%]), with a mean total CT score of 2 \u00b1 2; scans obtained in stage 2 (5\u20138 days) showed an increase in both the crazy-paving pattern (nine of 17 scans [53%]) and total CT score (mean, 6 \u00b1 4; P = .002); scans obtained in stage 3 (9\u201313 days) showed consolidation (19 of 21 scans [91%]) and a peak in the total CT score (mean, 7 \u00b1 4); and scans obtained in stage 4 (\u226514 days) showed gradual resolution of consolidation (15 of 20 scans [75%]) and a decrease in the total CT score (mean, 6 \u00b1 4) without crazy-paving pattern. Conclusion In patients recovering from coronavirus disease 2019 (without severe respiratory distress during the disease course), lung abnormalities on chest CT scans showed greatest severity approximately 10 days after initial onset of symptoms. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020",
        "To characterize intracranial plaque inflammation in vivo by using three-dimensional (3D) high-spatial-resolution contrast material-enhanced black-blood (BB) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and to investigate the relationship between intracranial plaque inflammation and cerebrovascular ischemic events.The study was approved by the institutional review board and was HIPAA compliant. Twenty-seven patients (19 men; mean age, 56.8 years \u00b1 12.4 [standard deviation]) with cerebrovascular ischemic events (acute stroke, n = 20; subacute stroke, n = 2; chronic stroke, n = 3; transient ischemic attack, n = 2) underwent 3D time-of-flight MR angiography and contrast-enhanced BB 3-T MR imaging for intracranial atherosclerotic disease. Each identified plaque was classified as either culprit (the only or most stenotic lesion upstream from a stroke), probably culprit (not the most stenotic lesion upstream from a stroke), or nonculprit (not within the vascular territory of a stroke). Plaque contrast enhancement was categorized on BB MR images (grade 0, enhancement less than or equal to that of normal arterial walls seen elsewhere; grade 1, enhancement greater than grade 0 but less than that of the pituitary infundibulum; grade 2, enhancement greater than or equal to that of the pituitary infundibulum), and degree of contrast enhancement was calculated. Associations of the likelihood of being a culprit lesion with both plaque contrast enhancement and plaque thickness were estimated with ordinal logistic regression.Seventy-eight plaques were identified in 20 patients with acute stroke (21 [27%] culprit, 12 [15%] probably culprit, and 45 [58%] nonculprit plaques). In these patients, grade 2 contrast enhancement was associated with culprit plaques (odds ratio 34.6; 95% confidence interval: 4.5, 266.5 compared with grade 0) when adjusted for plaque thickness. Grade 0 was observed in only nonculprit plaques. Culprit plaques had a higher degree of contrast enhancement than did nonculprit plaques (25.9% \u00b1 13.4 vs 13.6% \u00b1 12.3, P = .003).Contrast enhancement of intracranial atherosclerotic plaque is associated with its likelihood to have caused a recent ischemic event and may serve as a marker of its stability, thereby providing important insight into stroke risk.",
        "Purpose To prospectively evaluate dose reduction and image quality characteristics of abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scans reconstructed with model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) compared with adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) in oncology patients with colorectal liver metastases. Materials and Methods The study complied with HIPAA guidelines and was approved by the ethics committee of the institutional review board. All patients gave written informed consent. Fifty-one patients with colorectal liver metastases underwent body CT (thorax and abdomen) with a 64-section multidetector unit. With a radiation dose reduction by 2.36 mGy compared to standard of care CT with ASIR 50% (radiation dose, 7.54 mGy), MBIR can provide diagnostically acceptable CT scans without compromising image quality. Two radiologists independently assessed randomized images in a blinded manner. Imaging sets were compared for lesion detection, lesion conspicuity, overall image quality, and signal-to-noise ratio with a paired sample t test. Inter- and intraobserver agreement was assessed with the Cohen \u03ba. Results The mean volume CT dose index was 5.18 mGy \u00b1 0.76, mean dose-length product 374 mGy \u00b7 cm \u00b1 63.47, mean effective diameter 29.38 cm \u00b1 3.46, and mean size-specific dose estimate 6.52 mGy \u00b1 0.73. In small liver lesions (<10 mm), detection and conspicuity were significantly higher with MBIR than with ASIR for both right (t = 3.245, P = .004 and t = 2.696, P = .013, respectively) and left (t = 2.390, P = .038 and t = 2.283, P = .046) liver lobes. Subjective image noise (t = 4.506, P < .001), artifacts (t = 3.479, P = .001), and diagnostic confidence (t = 2.643, P = .011) were significantly better with MBIR than with ASIR. Conclusion MBIR performed better than ASIR 50% at providing diagnostically acceptable CT scans without compromising image quality and in the detection of colorectal liver metastases. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "History A 70-year-old man was referred to our institution with chronic obstructive urinary symptoms and constipation for 2 years before admission. His medical history was unremarkable. Outside laboratory tests revealed an elevated serum prostate-specific antigen level (21.7 ng/mL [normal range, 0.00\u20134.00 ng/mL]), and urinalysis results were negative. He was admitted for evaluation of possible prostate cancer. The patient reported no specific symptoms of infection and denied fever, dysuria, hematuria, and abdominal pain. He had no family history of prostate cancer. On physical examination, he was afebrile, and the digital rectal examination was not painful. These findings were evidence of an enlarged prostate and a hard multilobulated mass, which was palpable bilaterally. The urologic team performed MRI of the prostate.",
        "Purpose To determine the accuracy of dual-energy computed tomographic (CT) quantitation in a phantom system comparing fast kilovolt peak-switching, dual-source, split-filter, sequential-scanning, and dual-layer detector systems. Materials and Methods A large elliptical phantom containing iodine (2, 5, and 15 mg/mL), simulated contrast material-enhanced blood, and soft-tissue inserts with known elemental compositions was scanned three to five times with seven dual-energy CT systems and a total of 10 kilovolt peak settings. Monochromatic images (50, 70, and 140 keV) and iodine concentration images were created. Mean iodine concentration and monochromatic attenuation for each insert and reconstruction energy level were recorded. Measurement bias was assessed by using the sum of the mean signed errors measured across relevant inserts for each monochromatic energy level and iodine concentration. Iodine and monochromatic errors were assessed by using the root sum of the squared error of all measurements. Results At least one acquisition paradigm per scanner had iodine biases (range, -2.6 to 1.5 mg/mL) with significant differences from zero. There were no significant differences in iodine error (range, 0.44-1.70 mg/mL) among the top five acquisition paradigms (one fast kilovolt peak switching, three dual source, and one sequential scanning). Monochromatic bias was smallest for 70 keV (-12.7 to 15.8 HU) and largest for 50 keV (-80.6 to 35.2 HU). There were no significant differences in monochromatic error (range, 11.4-52.0 HU) among the top three acquisition paradigms (one dual source and two fast kilovolt peak switching). The lowest accuracy for both measures was with a split-filter system. Conclusion Iodine and monochromatic accuracy varies among systems, but dual-source and fast kilovolt-switching generally provided the most accurate results in a large phantom. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To assess the reproducibility and the distribution of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) and diffusion-tensor (DT) imaging parameters in healthy renal cortex and medulla at baseline and after hydration or furosemide challenges.Using an institutional review board-approved HIPAA-compliant protocol with written informed consent, IVIM and DT imaging were performed at 3 T in 10 volunteers before and after water loading or furosemide administration. IVIM (apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC], tissue diffusivity [D(t)], perfusion fraction [f(p)], pseudodiffusivity [D(p)]) and DT (mean diffusivity [MD], fractional anisotropy [FA], eigenvalues [\u03bb(i)]) imaging parameters and urine output from serial bladder volumes were calculated. (a)Reproducibility was quantified with coefficient of variation, intraclass correlation coefficient, and Bland-Altman limits of agreement; (b) contrast and challenge response were quantified with analysis of variance; and (c) Pearson correlations were quantified with urine output.Good reproducibility was found for ADC, D(t), MD, FA, and \u03bb(i) (average coefficient of variation, 3.7% [cortex] and 5.0% [medulla]), and moderate reproducibility was found for D(p), f(p), and f(p) \u00b7 D(p) (average coefficient of variation, 18.7% [cortex] and 25.9% [medulla]). Baseline cortical diffusivities significantly exceeded medullary values except D(p), for which medullary values significantly exceeded cortical values, and \u03bb(1,) which showed no contrast. ADC, D(t), MD, and \u03bb(i) increased significantly for both challenges. Medullary diffusivity increases were dominated by transverse diffusion (1.72 \u00b1 0.09 [baseline] to 1.79 \u00b1 0.10 [hydration] \u03bcm(2)/msec, P = .0059; or 1.86 \u00b1 0.07 [furosemide] \u03bcm(2)/msec, P = .0094). Urine output correlated with cortical ADC with furosemide (r = 0.7, P = .034) and with medullary \u03bb(1) (r = 0.83, P = .0418), \u03bb(2) (r = 0.85, P = .0301), and MD (r = 0.82, P = .045) with hydration.Diffusion MR metrics are sensitive to flow changes in kidney induced by diuretic challenges. The results of this study suggest that vascular flow, tubular dilation, water reabsorption, and intratubular flow all play important roles in diffusion-weighted imaging contrast.",
        "Background Missed fractures are a common cause of diagnostic discrepancy between initial radiographic interpretation and the final read by board-certified radiologists. Purpose To assess the effect of assistance by artificial intelligence (AI) on diagnostic performances of physicians for fractures on radiographs. Materials and Methods This retrospective diagnostic study used the multi-reader, multi-case methodology based on an external multicenter data set of 480 examinations with at least 60 examinations per body region (foot and ankle, knee and leg, hip and pelvis, hand and wrist, elbow and arm, shoulder and clavicle, rib cage, and thoracolumbar spine) between July 2020 and January 2021. Fracture prevalence was set at 50%. The ground truth was determined by two musculoskeletal radiologists, with discrepancies solved by a third. Twenty-four readers (radiologists, orthopedists, emergency physicians, physician assistants, rheumatologists, family physicians) were presented the whole validation data set (n = 480), with and without AI assistance, with a 1-month minimum washout period. The primary analysis had to demonstrate superiority of sensitivity per patient and the noninferiority of specificity per patient at -3% margin with AI aid. Stand-alone AI performance was also assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves. Results A total of 480 patients were included (mean age, 59 years \u00b1 16 [standard deviation]; 327 women). The sensitivity per patient was 10.4% higher (95% CI: 6.9, 13.9; P < .001 for superiority) with AI aid (4331 of 5760 readings, 75.2%) than without AI (3732 of 5760 readings, 64.8%). The specificity per patient with AI aid (5504 of 5760 readings, 95.6%) was noninferior to that without AI aid (5217 of 5760 readings, 90.6%), with a difference of +5.0% (95% CI: +2.0, +8.0; P = .001 for noninferiority). AI shortened the average reading time by 6.3 seconds per examination (95% CI: -12.5, -0.1; P = .046). The sensitivity by patient gain was significant in all regions (+8.0% to +16.2%; P < .05) but shoulder and clavicle and spine (+4.2% and +2.6%; P = .12 and .52). Conclusion AI assistance improved the sensitivity and may even improve the specificity of fracture detection by radiologists and nonradiologists, without lengthening reading time.

        "Purpose To compare prostatic arterial embolization (PAE) and transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) in the care of patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Materials and Methods This prospective randomized clinical trial was approved by the institutional review board. A total of 114 patients provided written informed consent and were randomly assigned to undergo PAE (n = 57) or TURP (n = 57). The groups were compared regarding relevant adverse events and complications. Functional results\u2014including improvement of International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), quality of life (QOL), peak urinary flow, postvoiding residual urine volume, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, and prostate volume\u2014were assessed at 1-, 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-month follow-up between January 20, 2007, and January 31, 2012. Student t test, \u03c72 test, Fisher exact test, and repeated measures analysis of variance were used, as appropriate. Results Overall technical success rates for TURP and PAE were 100% and 94.7%, respectively; the clinical failure rates were 3.9% and 9.4%, respectively. The six functional results showed improvements after TURP and PAE at all follow-up time points when compared with preoperative values (P = .001). However, the TURP group showed greater degrees of improvement in the IPSS, QOL, peak urinary flow, and postvoiding residual urine volume at 1 and 3 months, as well as greater reductions in the PSA level and prostate volume at all follow-up time points, when compared with the PAE group (P < .05). The PAE group showed more overall adverse events and complications (P = .029), mostly related to acute urinary retention (25.9%), postembolization syndrome (11.1%), and treatment failures (5.3% technical; 9.4% clinical). Conclusion Both procedures resulted in significant clinical improvements in the treatment of BPH. However, the advantages of the PAE procedure must be weighed against the potential for technical and clinical failures in a minority of patients. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "Purpose To develop and evaluate the feasibility of deep learning approaches for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging\u2013based attenuation correction (AC) (termed deep MRAC) in brain positron emission tomography (PET)/MR imaging. Materials and Methods A PET/MR imaging AC pipeline was built by using a deep learning approach to generate pseudo computed tomographic (CT) scans from MR images. A deep convolutional auto-encoder network was trained to identify air, bone, and soft tissue in volumetric head MR images coregistered to CT data for training. A set of 30 retrospective three-dimensional T1-weighted head images was used to train the model, which was then evaluated in 10 patients by comparing the generated pseudo CT scan to an acquired CT scan. A prospective study was carried out for utilizing simultaneous PET/MR imaging for five subjects by using the proposed approach. Analysis of covariance and paired-sample t tests were used for statistical analysis to compare PET reconstruction error with deep MRAC and two existing MR imaging\u2013based AC approaches with CT-based AC. Results Deep MRAC provides an accurate pseudo CT scan with a mean Dice coefficient of 0.971 \u00b1 0.005 for air, 0.936 \u00b1 0.011 for soft tissue, and 0.803 \u00b1 0.021 for bone. Furthermore, deep MRAC provides good PET results, with average errors of less than 1% in most brain regions. Significantly lower PET reconstruction errors were realized with deep MRAC (\u22120.7% \u00b1 1.1) compared with Dixon-based soft-tissue and air segmentation (\u22125.8% \u00b1 3.1) and anatomic CT-based template registration (\u22124.8% \u00b1 2.2). Conclusion The authors developed an automated approach that allows generation of discrete-valued pseudo CT scans (soft tissue, bone, and air) from a single high-spatial-resolution diagnostic-quality three-dimensional MR image and evaluated it in brain PET/MR imaging. This deep learning approach for MR imaging\u2013based AC provided reduced PET reconstruction error relative to a CT-based standard within the brain compared with current MR imaging\u2013based AC approaches. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",

        "History A 70-year-old man had a posterior left thigh lesion confirmed to be biopsy-proven melanoma. The patient underwent wide excision and sentinel node biopsy, which showed absence of residual melanoma. Two years later, the patient noticed a subcentimeter subcutaneous lump in his thigh. Repeat excisional biopsy showed involvement of the surrounding soft tissue, consistent with a satellite lesion. Follow-up combined PET/CT revealed satellite nodules around the primary lesion, enabling confirmation of subcutaneous metastatic disease. The patient was subsequently started on nivolumab, an anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor that blocks PD-1 and is approved as a first-line treatment in patients with advanced metastatic melanoma. On the baseline scan prior to starting nivolumab, there were no CT findings that suggested metastatic disease, nor were there enlarged mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes. Five months after initiation of nivolumab treatment, the first follow-up chest CT scan was performed and showed new findings in the mediastinum (Fig 1) and bilateral lungs (Figs 2, 3). The patient remained asymptomatic during the treatment period. Furthermore, the subcutaneous metastatic disease remained stable during the treatment period, and no other site of metastatic disease was noted on follow-up CT scans obtained during the first 5 months of treatment. The patient had no prior history of infectious or occupational exposures. During the nivolumab treatment cycle, his pertinent laboratory values and physical examination findings were unremarkable.",
        "To determine the accuracy of texture analysis to differentiate fat-poor angiomyolipoma (fp-AML) from renal cell carcinoma (RCC) on unenhanced computed tomography (CT) images.In this institutional review board-approved retrospective case-control study, patients with AML and RCC were identified from the pathology database: there were 16 patients with fp-AML (no visible fat at unenhanced CT) and 84 patients with RCC. Axial unenhanced CT images were contoured manually by two independent analysts. Texture analysis was performed for each lesion, and reproducibility was assessed. Texture features related to the gray-level histogram, gray-level co-occurrence, and run-length matrix statistics were evaluated. The most discriminative features were used to generate support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Diagnostic accuracy of textural features was assessed and 10-fold cross validation was performed. Unenhanced CT images for each patient were independently reviewed by two blinded radiologists who subjectively graded lesion heterogeneity on a five-point scale. Differences in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) between subjective heterogeneity ratings and textural features were evaluated by using the DeLong method.There was lower lesion homogeneity and higher lesion entropy in RCCs (P \u2264 .01). A model incorporating several texture features resulted in an AUC of 0.89 \u00b1 0.04. The average SVM accuracy of textural features ranged from 83% to 91% (after 10-fold cross validation). An optimal subjective heterogeneity rating of 2 or higher was identified as a predictor of RCC for both readers, with no significant difference in AUC between readers (P = .06). Each of the three textural-based classifiers was more accurate than either radiologists' subjective heterogeneity ratings for the models incorporating a subset of the top three textural features (difference in AUC between textural features and subjective visual heterogeneity, 0.25; 95% confidence interval: 0.02, 0.47; P = .03).CT texture analysis can be used to accurately differentiate fp-AML from RCC on unenhanced CT images.",
        "Purpose To test whether computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) approaches can increase the positive predictive value (PPV) and reduce the false-positive rate in lung cancer screening for small nodules compared with human reading by thoracic radiologists. Materials and Methods A matched case-control sample of low-dose computed tomography (CT) studies in 186 participants with 4\u201320-mm noncalcified lung nodules who underwent biopsy in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) was selected. Variables used for matching were age, sex, smoking status, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease status, body mass index, study year of the positive screening test, and screening results. Studies before lung biopsy were randomly split into a training set (70 cancers plus 70 benign controls) and a validation set (20 cancers plus 26 benign controls). Image features from within and outside dominant nodules were extracted. A CAD algorithm developed from the training set and a random forest classifier were applied to the validation set to predict biopsy outcomes. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to compare the prediction accuracy of CAD with the NLST investigator's diagnosis and readings from three experienced and board-certified thoracic radiologists who used contemporary clinical practice guidelines. Results In the validation cohort, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for CAD was 0.9154. By default, the sensitivity, specificity, and PPV of the NLST investigators were 1.00, 0.00, and 0.43, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and negative predictive value of CAD and the three radiologists' combined reading were 0.95, 0.88, 0.86, and 0.96 and 0.70, 0.69, 0.64, and 0.75, respectively. Conclusion CAD could increase PPV and reduce the false-positive rate in the early diagnosis of lung cancer. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To determine whether fluoroscopic balloon dilation (FBD) is a safe and effective method of treating esophageal anastomotic stricture after surgical repair in an unselected patient population.With ethics committee approval, records for 103 consecutive patients who underwent FBD with our interventional radiology service (1999-2011) were reviewed retrospectively. Patients underwent diagnostic contrast material-enhanced study prior to the first dilation. Dilations were performed by using general anesthesia. Outcomes were number and/or frequency of dilations, clinical effectiveness and response to dilations, esophageal perforation, requirement for surgery, and mortality. Data were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (with range). Comparisons were conducted by using the Fisher exact test and log-rank test. The significance level was set at P < .05.One hundred three patients (61 male patients, 59%) underwent 378 FBD sessions (median, two dilations per patient; range, 1-40 dilations). The median age at first FBD was 2.2 years (range, 0.1-19.5 years). The balloon catheter diameters ranged from 4 to 20 mm. FBD was successful in 93 patients (90%): 44 (47%) after single dilation and 49 (53%) after multiple dilations. There was no difference in the proportion of patients who required one dilation and were younger than 1 year versus those who were 1 year of age and older (P > .99; odds ratio, 1.07 [range, 0.43-2.66]). Ten patients (10%) required further procedures: Three underwent stent placement, three underwent esophageal stricture resection, and four underwent esophageal reconstruction. Four esophageal perforations (1%) developed after FBD. Antireflux surgery was performed in 18 patients (17%). There were no deaths.FBD for anastomotic strictures after esophageal atresia repair is feasible and acceptably safe and provides relief of symptoms in most patients (90%); however, about half require more than one dilation, and surgery is best predicted if more than 10 dilations are required.",
        "Purpose To determine whether spinal cord atrophy differs among disease subtypes in multiple sclerosis (MS) and whether it offers diagnostic and clinical correlative information beyond that provided by other magnetic resonance (MR) imaging markers. Materials and Methods The institutional review board approved the study; all subjects gave written informed consent. Upper cervical cord cross-sectional area (UCCA), brain and spinal cord lesion loads, and brain atrophy were measured in 440 patients with MS (311 with relapsing-remitting [RR] MS, 92 with secondary-progressive [SP] MS, and 37 with primary-progressive [PP] MS) studied in two centers. Disability was scored with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), the timed 25-foot walk test (TWT), and the nine-hole peg test. UCCA was compared between groups with the Mann-Whitney U test. Correlations were assessed with the Spearman \u03c1 test. Multivariate associations between UCCA and clinical and other MR imaging parameters, including number of hypointense brain lesions on T1-weighted MR images, presence of diffuse abnormalities, and number of involved segments in the spinal cord, were assessed by using multiple linear regression, adjusted for study center site. Results The UCCA in patients with SP MS (median, 79 mm2; interquartile range, 72.4\u201384.9 mm2) and PP MS (median, 77.3 mm2; interquartile range, 69\u201382.5 mm2) was significantly smaller (P < .001) than that in patients with RR MS (median, 84 mm2; interquartile range, 78.7\u201389.3 mm2). UCCA was inversely correlated with EDSS score, TWT, and nine-hole peg test findings (\u03c1 \u2264 \u22120.29, P < .001 for all comparisons). UCCA, number of hypointense brain lesions on T1-weighted MR images, presence of diffuse abnormalities, and number of involved segments in the spinal cord were found to be significant explanatory factors for clinical disability (R2 = 0.564). The UCCA and the number of hypointense brain lesions on T1-weighted images were the strongest MR imaging parameters for explaining physical disability, as measured with the EDSS. Conclusion Spinal cord abnormalities have a strong effect on clinical disability in MS. MR imaging\u2013derived UCCA was found to be the most significant spinal cord parameter for explaining EDSS score. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "Objective: To analyze the prevalence of non-contiguous injury of spinal cord using MRI with a focus on cervical spinal injury patients.\r\n\r\nMethods: 60 cervical spinal injury patients were reviewed using the NIMIS (National Integrated Medical Imaging System) system. The MR imaging and imaging reports for cervical spinal injury were reviewed in a University Teaching Hospital in West Ireland (45 male and 15 female). The mean age of patients in this population group was 42. They were divided into three groups based on the mechanism of injury; hyperflexion, hyperextension and axial injury as per ASIA guidelines. The presence or absence of non-contiguous spinal injury was confirmed as to whether there was marrow contusion, herniation, or fracture at any area along the spine. During evaluation of spinal injury the cervical spine is often prioritized, however the importance of surveying the entire spine is essential. It has been emphasized that the whole cervical spine including the cervicothoracic junction (CTJ)\r\n\r\nResults: A total of 9 cases (15%) showed CTJ or upper thoracic spinal injuries defined as C7-L1 injury. 2 of 21 cases revealed obvious fractures in the CTJs or upper thoracic spines. Ligamentous injury in these regions was found in only one case, Traumatic disc herniation in four cases and spinal cord injury in five cases. Nerve impingement was observed in two cases. The incidence of non-contiguous spinal injuries was higher in the axial compression injury group (25%) than in the hyperflexion injury group (21%) or the hyperextension (20%) injury group, highlighting the importance of injury mechanism.\r\n\r\nConclusion: Cervical spinal MR showed non-contiguous CTJ or upper thoracic spinal injuries in 28% of the patients with cervical spinal injury. The mechanism of cervical spinal injury did not significantly affect the incidence of the noncontiguous CTJ or upper thoracic spinal injury. Physicians in Ireland should consider imaging other areas of the spine when a cervical spinal injury is suspected.",
        "Purpose To conduct a comprehensive analysis of radiologist-made assessments of glioblastoma (GBM) tumor size and composition by using a community-developed controlled terminology of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging visual features as they relate to genetic alterations, gene expression class, and patient survival. Materials and Methods Because all study patients had been previously deidentified by the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), a publicly available data set that contains no linkage to patient identifiers and that is HIPAA compliant, no institutional review board approval was required. Presurgical MR images of 75 patients with GBM with genetic data in the TCGA portal were rated by three neuroradiologists for size, location, and tumor morphology by using a standardized feature set. Interrater agreements were analyzed by using the Krippendorff \u03b1 statistic and intraclass correlation coefficient. Associations between survival, tumor size, and morphology were determined by using multivariate Cox regression models; associations between imaging features and genomics were studied by using the Fisher exact test. Results Interrater analysis showed significant agreement in terms of contrast material enhancement, nonenhancement, necrosis, edema, and size variables. Contrast-enhanced tumor volume and longest axis length of tumor were strongly associated with poor survival (respectively, hazard ratio: 8.84, P = .0253, and hazard ratio: 1.02, P = .00973), even after adjusting for Karnofsky performance score (P = .0208). Proneural class GBM had significantly lower levels of contrast enhancement (P = .02) than other subtypes, while mesenchymal GBM showed lower levels of nonenhanced tumor (P < .01). Conclusion This analysis demonstrates a method for consistent image feature annotation capable of reproducibly characterizing brain tumors; this study shows that radiologists' estimations of macroscopic imaging features can be combined with genetic alterations and gene expression subtypes to provide deeper insight to the underlying biologic properties of GBM subsets. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "To compare magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings and clinical assessment for prediction of pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in patients with stage II or III breast cancer.The HIPAA-compliant protocol and the informed consent process were approved by the American College of Radiology Institutional Review Board and local-site institutional review boards. Women with invasive breast cancer of 3 cm or greater undergoing NACT with an anthracycline-based regimen, with or without a taxane, were enrolled between May 2002 and March 2006. MR imaging was performed before NACT (first examination), after one cycle of anthracyline-based treatment (second examination), between the anthracycline-based regimen and taxane (third examination), and after all chemotherapy and prior to surgery (fourth examination). MR imaging assessment included measurements of tumor longest diameter and volume and peak signal enhancement ratio. Clinical size was also recorded at each time point. Change in clinical and MR imaging predictor variables were compared for the ability to predict pathologic complete response (pCR) and residual cancer burden (RCB). Univariate and multivariate random-effects logistic regression models were used to characterize the ability of tumor response measurements to predict pathologic outcome, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) used as a summary statistic.Data in 216 women (age range, 26-68 years) with two or more imaging time points were analyzed. For prediction of both pCR and RCB, MR imaging size measurements were superior to clinical examination at all time points, with tumor volume change showing the greatest relative benefit at the second MR imaging examination. AUC differences between MR imaging volume and clinical size predictors at the early, mid-, and posttreatment time points, respectively, were 0.14, 0.09, and 0.02 for prediction of pCR and 0.09, 0.07, and 0.05 for prediction of RCB. In multivariate analysis, the AUC for predicting pCR at the second imaging examination increased from 0.70 for volume alone to 0.73 when all four predictor variables were used. Additional predictive value was gained with adjustments for age and race.MR imaging findings are a stronger predictor of pathologic response to NACT than clinical assessment, with the greatest advantage observed with the use of volumetric measurement of tumor response early in treatment.",
        "To compare screening recall rates and cancer detection rates of tomosynthesis plus conventional digital mammography to those of conventional digital mammography alone.All patients presenting for screening mammography between October 1, 2011, and September 30, 2012, at four clinical sites were reviewed in this HIPAA-compliant retrospective study, for which the institutional review board granted approval and waived the requirement for informed consent. Patients at sites with digital tomosynthesis were offered screening with digital mammography plus tomosynthesis. Patients at sites without tomosynthesis underwent conventional digital mammography. Recall rates were calculated and stratified according to breast density and patient age. Cancer detection rates were calculated and stratified according to the presence of a risk factor for breast cancer. The Fisher exact test was used to compare the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the effect of screening method, breast density, patient age, and cancer risk on the odds of recall from screening.A total of 13 158 patients presented for screening mammography; 6100 received tomosynthesis. The overall recall rate was 8.4% for patients in the tomosynthesis group and 12.0% for those in the conventional mammography group (P < .01). The addition of tomosynthesis reduced recall rates for all breast density and patient age groups, with significant differences (P < .05) found for scattered fibroglandular, heterogeneously dense, and extremely dense breasts and for patients younger than 40 years, those aged 40-49 years, those aged 50-59 years, and those aged 60-69 years. These findings persisted when multivariate logistic regression was used to control for differences in age, breast density, and elevated risk of breast cancer. The cancer detection rate was 5.7 per 1000 in patients receiving tomosynthesis versus 5.2 per 1000 in patients receiving conventional mammography alone (P = .70).Patients undergoing tomosynthesis plus digital mammography had significantly lower screening recall rates. The greatest reductions were for those younger than 50 years and those with dense breasts. A nonsignificant 9.5% increase in cancer detection was observed in the tomosynthesis group.",

        "Background Early stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the ideal candidate for resection in patients with preserved liver function; however, cancer will recur in half of these patients and no reliable prognostic tool has been established. Purpose To investigate the effectiveness of radiomic features in predicting tumor recurrence after resection of early stage HCC. Materials and Methods In total, 295 patients (median age, 58 years; interquartile range, 50\u201365 years; 221 men) who underwent contrast material\u2013enhanced CT and curative resection for early stage HCC that met the Milan criteria between February 2009 and December 2016 were retrospectively recruited from three independent institutions. Follow-up consisted of serum \u03b1-fetoprotein level, liver function tests, and dynamic imaging examinations every 3 months during the first 2 years and then every 6 months thereafter. In the development cohort of 177 patients from institution 1, recurrence-related radiomic features were computationally extracted from the tumor and its periphery and a radiomics signature was built with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression. Two models, one integrating preoperative and one integrating pre- and postoperative variables, were created by using multivariable Cox regression analysis. An independent external cohort of 118 patients from institutions 2 and 3 was used to validate the proposed models. Results The preoperative model integrated radiomics signature with serum \u03b1-fetoprotein level and tumor number; the postoperative model incorporated microvascular invasion and satellite nodules into the above-mentioned predictors. In both study cohorts, two radiomics-based models provided better predictive performance (concordance index \u22650.77, P < .05 for all), lower prediction error (integrated Brier score \u22640.14), and larger net benefits, as determined by means of decision curve analysis, than rival models without radiomics and widely adopted staging systems. The radiomics-based models gave three risk strata with high, intermediate, or low risk of recurrence and distinct profiles of recurrent tumor number. Conclusion The proposed radiomics models with pre- and postresection features helped predict tumor recurrence for early stage hepatocellular carcinoma. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "History A 17-year-old white male adolescent was re-evaluated for a withheld cardiac condition initially detected during prenatal imaging at an outside institution. He had previously experienced intermittent episodes of shortness of breath, chest pain, and palpitations with exertion, but more recently he had been asymptomatic. He had no other comorbidities and no family history of congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, or sudden cardiac death. At physical examination, the patient had a grade II/IV rumbling systolic murmur best heard at the left upper sternal border. Otherwise, cardiovascular and other physical examination findings were normal. An electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia and nonspecific T wave changes. A graded exercise stress test was normal. Cardiac MRI was performed without and with gadolinium-based contrast material. Multiple echocardiograms obtained since birth, cardiac MR images obtained 2 and 4 years earlier, and nongated CT images obtained with iodinated contrast material to evaluate trauma 8 years prior showed findings similar to those of the current examination. Prior chest radiographs (not shown) were normal, and angiography performed when the patient was 4 years old revealed normal coronary arteries.",
        "Background Mounting evidence suggests that the choroid plexus (CP) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer disease (AD), but its imaging profile in cognitive impairment remains unclear. Purpose To evaluate CP volume, permeability, and susceptibility by using MRI in patients at various stages of cognitive impairment. Materials and Methods This retrospective study evaluated patients with cognitive symptoms who underwent 3.0-T MRI of the brain, including dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), between January 2013 and May 2020. CP volume was automatically segmented using three-dimensional T1-weighted sequences; the volume transfer constant (ie, Ktrans) and fractional plasma volume (ie, Vp) were determined using DCE MRI, and susceptibility was assessed using QSM. The effects of CP volume, expressed as the ratio to intracranial volume, on cognition were evaluated using multivariable linear regression adjusted for age, sex, education, apolipoprotein E \u03b54 allele status, and volumetric measures. Results A total of 532 patients with cognitive symptoms (mean age, 72 years \u00b1 9 [SD]; 388 women) were included: 78 with subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), 158 with early mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 149 with late MCI, and 147 with AD. Among these, 132 patients underwent DCE MRI and QSM. CP volume was greater in patients at more severe stages (ratio of intracranial volume \u00d7 103: 0.9 \u00b1 0.3 for SCI, 1.0 \u00b1 0.3 for early MCI, 1.1 \u00b1 0.3 for late MCI, and 1.3 \u00b1 0.4 for AD; P < .001). Lower Ktrans (r = -0.19; P = .03) and Vp (r = -0.20; P = .02) were negatively associated with CP volume; susceptibility was not (r = 0.15; P = .10). CP volume was negatively associated with memory (B = -0.67; standard error of the mean [SEM], 0.21; P = .01), executive function (B = -0.90; SEM, 0.31; P = .01), and global cognition (B = -0.82; SEM, 0.32; P = .01). Conclusion Among patients with cognitive symptoms, larger choroid plexus volume was associated with severity of cognitive impairment in the Alzheimer disease spectrum.

        "Purpose To evaluate whether patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)\u2014a multisystem neurodevelopmental disorder with myriad imaging manifestations, including focal transient myelin vacuolization within the deep gray nuclei, brainstem, and cerebellum\u2014exhibit differences in cortical and subcortical structures, particularly in subcortical regions where these abnormalities manifest. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, by using clinically obtained three-dimensional T1-weighted MR images and established image analysis methods, 10 intracranial volume\u2013corrected subcortical and 34 cortical regions of interest (ROIs) were quantitatively assessed in 32 patients with NF1 and 245 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. By using linear models, ROI cortical thicknesses and volumes were compared between patients with NF1 and control subjects, as a function of age. With hierarchic cluster analysis and partial correlations, differences in the pattern of association between cortical and subcortical ROI volumes in patients with NF1 and control subjects were also evaluated. Results Patients with NF1 exhibited larger subcortical volumes and thicker cortices of select regions, particularly the hippocampi, amygdalae, cerebellar white matter, ventral diencephalon, thalami, and occipital cortices. For the thalami and pallida and 22 cortical ROIs in patients with NF1, a significant inverse association between volume and age was found, suggesting that volumes decrease with increasing age. Moreover, compared with those in control subjects, ROIs in patients with NF1 exhibited a distinct pattern of clustering and partial correlations. Discussion Neurofibromatosis type 1 is characterized by larger subcortical volumes and thicker cortices of select structures. Most apparent within the hippocampi, amygdalae, cerebellar white matter, ventral diencephalon, thalami and occipital cortices, these neurofibromatosis type 1\u2013associated volumetric changes may, in part, be age dependent. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To validate an on-site algorithm for computation of fractional flow reserve (FFR) from coronary computed tomographic (CT) angiography data against invasively measured FFR and to test its diagnostic performance as compared with that of coronary CT angiography.The institutional review board provided a waiver for this retrospective study. From coronary CT angiography data in 106 patients, FFR was computed at a local workstation by using a computational fluid dynamics algorithm. Invasive FFR measurement was performed in 189 vessels (80 of which had an FFR \u2264 0.80); these measurements were regarded as the reference standard. The diagnostic characteristics of coronary CT angiography-derived computational FFR, coronary CT angiography, and quantitative coronary angiography were evaluated against those of invasively measured FFR by using C statistics. Sensitivity and specificity were compared by using a two-sided McNemar test.For computational FFR, sensitivity was 87.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 78.2%, 93.8%), specificity was 65.1% (95% CI: 55.4%, 74.0%), and accuracy was 74.6% (95% CI: 68.4%, 80.8%), as compared with the finding of lumen stenosis of 50% or greater at coronary CT angiography, for which sensitivity was 81.3% (95% CI: 71.0%, 89.1%), specificity was 37.6% (95% CI: 28.5%, 47.4%), and accuracy was 56.1% (95% CI: 49.0%, 63.2%). C statistics revealed a larger area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for computational FFR (AUC, 0.83) than for coronary CT angiography (AUC, 0.64). For vessels with intermediate (25%-69%) stenosis, the sensitivity of computational FFR was 87.3% (95% CI: 76.5%, 94.3%) and the specificity was 59.3% (95% CI: 47.8%, 70.1%).With use of a reduced-order algorithm, computation of the FFR from coronary CT angiography data can be performed locally, at a regular workstation. The diagnostic accuracy of coronary CT angiography-derived computational FFR for the detection of functionally important coronary artery disease (CAD) was good and was incremental to that of coronary CT angiography within a population with a high prevalence of CAD.",
        "Background Protective factors against the risk of bronchiectasis are unknown. A high level of cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with a lower risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. But whether fitness relates to bronchiectasis remains, to the knowledge of the authors, unknown. Purpose To examine the association between cardiorespiratory fitness and bronchiectasis. Materials and Methods This was a secondary analysis of a prospective observational study: the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults cohort (from 1985\u20131986 [year 0] to 2015\u20132016 [year 30]). During a 30-year period, healthy participants (age at enrollment 18\u201330 years) underwent treadmill exercise testing at year 0 and year 20 visits. Cardiorespiratory fitness was determined according to the treadmill exercise duration. The 20-year difference in cardiorespiratory fitness was used as the fitness measurement. At year 25, chest CT was performed to assess bronchiectasis and was used as the primary outcome. Multivariable logistic models were performed to determine the association between cardiorespiratory fitness changes and bronchiectasis. Results Of 2177 selected participants (at year 0: mean age, 25 years \u00b1 4 [standard deviation]; 1224 women), 209 (9.6%) had bronchiectasis at year 25. After adjusting for age, race-sex group, study site, body mass index, pack-years smoked, history of tuberculosis, pneumonia, asthma and myocardial infarction, peak lung function, and cardiorespiratory fitness at baseline, preservation of cardiorespiratory fitness was associated with lower odds of bronchiectasis at CT at year 25 (per 1-minute\u2013longer treadmill duration from year 0 to year 20: odds ratio [OR], 0.88; 95% CI: 0.80, 0.98; P = .02). A consistent strong association was found when cough and phlegm were included in bronchiectasis (OR, 0.72; 95% CI: 0.59, 0.87; P < .001). Conclusion In a long-term follow-up, the preservation of cardiorespiratory fitness was associated with lower odds of bronchiectasis at CT. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "A 61-year-old woman was admitted to our institution to characterize an incidentally found mass in the porta hepatis. An episode of pulmonary embolism (18 months ago) and a pulmonary abscess (15 months ago) were reported. The patient had no history of known liver disease, previous cancer diagnosis, or trauma. She underwent total thyroidectomy for goiter several years ago, with initial iatrogenic hypothyroidism treated with levo-thyroxine hormone replacement therapy. During follow-up, this therapy was adjusted (50 \u03bcg per day) to induce euthyroidism and to achieve a target serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration of 1-2 mIU/L. Physical examination findings were unremarkable. Admission laboratory data were entirely normal, including tumor markers, such as carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9. Unenhanced and multiphasic contrast-enhanced CT imaging was performed in arterial, portal venous, and delayed (3 minutes after injection) phases. Axial and coronal maximum intensity projection reconstructed CT images were obtained in the arterial and portal venous phases. Because of the imaging findings of the mass in the porta hepatis and concerns about malignancy, the patient underwent endoscopy. Therefore, endoscopic US-guided fine-needle biopsy was performed in the same session. The patient also underwent whole-body iodine 131 (131I) scintigraphy.",
        "Purpose To assess the reproducibility of aortic volume estimates and to serially test their use in patients with Marfan syndrome. Materials and Methods The study was approved by the medical ethics committee and all subjects gave written informed consent. In 81 patients with Marfan syndrome and seven healthy control subjects, aortic volumes and diameters at baseline were estimated by means of contrast material\u2013enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. At 3 years of follow-up, aortic expansion rate were calculated in a subgroup of 22 patients with Marfan syndrome. Total aortic volume was defined as volume measurement from the level of the aortic annulus to the aortic bifurcation. Intra- and interobserver agreement of aortic volume were calculated by using the intraclass correlation coefficient. Differences in variables were analyzed with the Student t test and logistic regression. Effect size was calculated. Results Intra- and interobserver agreement of aortic volume calculation was 0.996 and 0.980, respectively. Mean aortic volume was significantly greater in patients with Marfan syndrome than in control subjects (104 mL/m2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 95, 114 mL/m2 vs 74 mL/m2; 95% CI: 62, 87 mL/m2; P < .001). In 22 patients with Marfan syndrome, mean aortic volume was increased at 3 years of follow-up (17 mL; 95% CI: 8, 26 mL; P = .001; effect size, 0.29), while mean aortic diameter did not increase significantly (0.4 mm; 95% CI: 0.0, 0.9 mm; P = .171; effect size, 0.13). Conclusion Assessment of aortic volume is highly reproducible and may be suited for use in the detection of aortic expansion in patients with Marfan syndrome. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Supplemental material: S1",
        "To investigate the patterns of imaging appearance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) on gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) images and to assess their potential value as prognostic markers of HCC associated with tumor recurrence after surgery.The institutional review board approved this retrospective study and informed consent was waived. A total of 216 patients with 304 pathologically proved HCCs underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging prior to surgery and were included in the study. Two reviewers, blinded to the clinical data, evaluated in consensus the imaging patterns of HCC according to enhancement patterns on dynamic phase images and signal intensity on hepatobiliary phase (HBP) images. The association of imaging features with clinical-pathologic findings was evaluated by using the Student t test, \u03c7(2) test, Mann-Whitney U test, and linear-by-linear association. The dependence of time to tumor recurrence (TTR) after surgery was evaluated by using the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazard model.HCCs with atypical enhancement pattern (P = .0167, P = .0450, P < .0001, respectively) and iso- to hyperintensity on HBP images (P = .0001, P = .0002, P < .0001, respectively) had smaller tumor size, lower histologic grade, and worse Child-Pugh class. The log-rank test (P = .0064) and Cox proportional hazards model (hazard ratio, 5.676; P = .0158) revealed that HCCs with iso- to hyperintensity on HBP images had significantly longer TTR than HCCs with hypointensity on HBP images.HCCs can be classified into several imaging patterns on gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR images, which are associated with tumor aggressiveness and outcome. In addition, iso- to hyperintensity on HBP images may be a useful imaging biomarker to indicate longer TTR after surgery. .",

        "Purpose To determine whether texture features on pretreatment contrast material-enhanced computed tomographic (CT) images can help predict overall survival (OS) and time to progression (TTP) in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with sorafenib. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included 92 patients with advanced HCC treated with sorafenib between January 2009 and April 2015 at two independent university hospitals. Sixty-four of the 92 patients (70%) (six women, 58 men; median age, 66 years) were included from institution 1 and constituted a training cohort; 28 patients (30%) (five women, 23 men; median age, 64 years) were included from institution 2 and constituted a validation cohort. Pretreatment CT texture analysis was performed on late arterial and portal venous phase HCC images. Mean gray-level intensity, entropy, kurtosis, skewness, and standard deviation values were derived from the pixel distribution histogram before and after spatial filtration at different anatomic scales ranging from fine to coarse texture. Lesion heterogeneity was also visually graded on a 4-point scale. Correlations between visual analysis and texture parameters were assessed with the Spearman rank correlation. Univariate Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed in the training cohort to identify independent predictors of OS and TTP. Their predictive capacity was tested on the validation cohort by using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results Visual analysis of tumor heterogeneity correlated with entropy at both arterial (P = .012) and portal venous (P = .038) phases. Portal phase-derived entropy at fine (hazard ratio [HR], 5.08; P = .0033), medium (HR, 2.23; P = .019), and coarse (HR, 2.26; P = .0032) texture scales was identified as an independent predictor of OS and confirmed in the validation cohort (P < .05). The difference in median survival between patients in the validation cohort with entropy values below and above the identified threshold was 272 days (with fine texture) and 741 days (with medium and coarse textures). Arterial phase-derived texture parameters (P > .085) and visual analysis (P > .11) were not associated with changes in survival. Conclusion Pretreatment portal venous phase-derived tumor entropy may be a predictor of survival in patients with advanced HCC treated with sorafenib.",
        "To determine the effect of baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) on the causal association between intravenous iodinated contrast material exposure and subsequent development of acute kidney injury (AKI) in propensity score-matched groups of patients who underwent contrast material-enhanced or unenhanced computed tomography (CT).This retrospective study was HIPAA compliant and institutional review board approved. All patients who underwent contrast-enhanced (contrast material group) or unenhanced (non-contrast material group) CT between 2000 and 2010 were identified and stratified according to baseline eGFR by using Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative cutoffs for chronic kidney disease into subgroups with eGFR of 90 or greater, 60-89, 30-59, and less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Propensity score generation and 1:1 matching of patients were performed in each eGFR subgroup. Incidence of AKI (serum creatinine [SCr] increase of \u22650.5 mg/dL [\u226544.2 \u03bcmol/L] above baseline) was compared in the matched subgroups by using the Fisher exact test.A total of 12 508 propensity score-matched patients with contrast-enhanced and unenhanced scans met all inclusion criteria. In this predominantly inpatient cohort, the incidence of AKI significantly increased with decreasing baseline eGFR (P < .0001). However, this incidence was not significantly different between contrast material and non-contrast material groups in any eGFR subgroup; for the subgroup with eGFR of 90 or greater (n = 1642), odds ratio (OR) was 0.91 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.38, 2.15), P = .82; for the subgroup with eGFR of 60-89 (n = 3870), OR was 1.03 (95% CI: 0.66, 1.60), P = .99; for the subgroup with eGFR of 30-59 (n = 5510), OR was 0.94 (95% CI: 0.76, 1.18), P = .65; and for the subgroup with eGFR of less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (n = 1486), OR was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.72, 1.30), P = .89.Diminished eGFR is associated with an increased risk of SCr-defined AKI following CT examinations. However, the risk of AKI is independent of contrast material exposure, even in patients with eGFR of less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2).",
        "Purpose To investigate whether radiomic features at MRI improve survival prediction in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) when they are integrated with clinical and genetic profiles. Materials and Methods Data in patients with a diagnosis of GBM between December 2009 and January 2017 (217 patients) were retrospectively reviewed up to May 2017 and allocated to training and test sets (3:1 ratio). Radiomic features (n = 796) were extracted from multiparametric MRI. A random survival forest (RSF) model was trained with the radiomic features along with clinical and genetic profiles (O-6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase promoter methylation and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutation statuses) to predict overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). The RSF models were validated on the test set. The incremental values of radiomic features were evaluated by using the integrated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (iAUC). Results The 217 patients had a mean age of 57.9 years, and there were 87 female patients (age range, 22-81 years) and 130 male patients (age range, 17-85 years). The median OS and PFS of patients were 352 days (range, 20-1809 days) and 264 days (range, 21-1809 days), respectively. The RSF radiomics models were successfully validated on the test set (iAUC, 0.652 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.524, 0.769] and 0.590 [95% CI: 0.502, 0.689] for OS and PFS, respectively). The addition of a radiomics model to clinical and genetic profiles improved survival prediction when compared with models containing clinical and genetic profiles alone (P = .04 and .03 for OS and PFS, respectively).

        "Background Children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) are predisposed to developing leg ulcers in early adolescence; however, the underlying physiologic mechanisms are not well understood, which hinders the development of prophylactic antiulcer interventions. Purpose To determine if occlusive arterial disease or abnormal hemodynamics exist in the lower limb peripheral arteries of children with SCA. Materials and Methods This was a prospective cross-sectional study conducted between July 2020 and May 2021. Two groups of participants were enrolled: children with SCA and healthy controls. Each child had their anthropometric measurements taken, followed by B-mode, color Doppler, and spectral Doppler US evaluation of the distal anterior and posterior tibial arteries. Ankle-brachial index evaluation was also performed. Hemodynamic values were compared between children with SCA and healthy controls, with statistical significance set at the P < .05 level. Results Forty-five children with SCA (mean age, 9.5 years \u00b1 3.7 [SD]; 26 boys) and 45 healthy controls (mean age, 9.3 years \u00b1 3.8; 25 boys) were evaluated. Children with SCA had higher peak systolic velocities, end-diastolic velocities, and blood volume flow in their distal anterior and posterior tibial arteries compared with the healthy participants (P < .001 across all 12 measurements). Children with SCA also had lower resistive index and pulsatility index values compared with healthy controls in at least one of the anterior and posterior tibial arteries bilaterally. Monophasic spectral patterns were exclusively observed in participants with SCA. The ankle-brachial index values for the participants with SCA (mean, 1.09 \u00b1 0.08) and healthy participants (mean, 1.06 \u00b1 0.02) were within normal range. Conclusion Abnormal peripheral hemodynamic characteristics were found in the lower limbs of children with sickle cell anemia. No evidence of occlusive peripheral artery disease was present. \u00a9 RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article. See also the editorial by Paltiel in this issue.",
        "Purpose To evaluate the early implementation of synthesized two-dimensional (s2D) mammography in a population screened entirely with s2D and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) (referred to as s2D/DBT) and compare recall rates and cancer detection rates to historic outcomes of digital mammography combined with DBT (referred to as digital mammography/DBT) screening. Materials and Methods This was an institutional review board\u2013approved and HIPAA-compliant retrospective interpretation of prospectively acquired data with waiver of informed consent. Compared were recall rates, biopsy rates, cancer detection rates, and radiation dose for 15 571 women screened with digital mammography/DBT from October 1, 2011, to February 28, 2013, and 5366 women screened with s2D/DBT from January 7, 2015, to June 30, 2015. Two-sample z tests of equal proportions were used to determine statistical significance. Results Recall rate for s2D/DBT versus digital mammography/DBT was 7.1% versus 8.8%, respectively (P < .001). Biopsy rate for s2D/DBT versus digital mammography/DBT decreased (1.3% vs 2.0%, respectively; P = .001). There was no significant difference in cancer detection rate for s2D/DBT versus digital mammography/DBT (5.03 of 1000 vs 5.45 of 1000, respectively; P = .72). The average glandular dose was 39% lower in s2D/DBT versus digital mammography/DBT (4.88 mGy vs 7.97 mGy, respectively; P < .001). Conclusion Screening with s2D/DBT in a large urban practice resulted in similar outcomes compared with digital mammography/DBT imaging. Screening with s2D/DBT allowed for the benefits of DBT with a decrease in radiation dose compared with digital mammography/DBT. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016 An earlier incorrect version of this article appeared online.

        "Background The substantia nigra (SN) is suspected to be affected after remote infarction, in view of its large array of connections with the supratentorial brain. Whether secondary involvement of SN worsens overall clinical outcome after a supratentorial stroke has not previously been studied. Purpose To assess longitudinal changes in SN R2* by using MRI in the setting of ipsilesional supratentorial infarct and the relationship of SN signal change to clinical outcome. Materials and Methods Participants prospectively included from 2012 to 2015 were evaluated at 24-72 hours (baseline visit) and at 1 year with MRI to quantify R2*. The SN was segmented bilaterally to calculate an R2* asymmetry index (SN-AI); greater SN-AI indicated greater relative R2* in the ipsilateral compared with contralateral SN. The 95th percentile of R2* (hereafter, SN-AI95) was compared according to infarct location with mixed linear regression models. We also conducted voxel-based comparisons of R2* and identified individual infarcted voxels associated with high SN-AI95 through voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping. Multivariable regression models tested the association between SN-AI95 and clinical scores. Results A total of 181 participants were evaluated (127 men, 54 women; mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 64.2 years \u00b1 13.1; 75 striatum infarcts, 106 other locations). Visual inspection, SN-AI95, and average maps consistently showed higher SN R2* at 1 year if ipsilateral striatum was infarcted than if it was not (SN-AI95, 4.25 vs -0.88; P < .001), but this was not observed at baseline. The striatal location of the infarct was associated with higher SN-AI95 at 1 year independently from infarct volume, SN-AI95 at baseline, microbleeds, age, and sex (\u03b2 = 4.99; P < .001). Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping confirmed that striatum but also insula, internal capsule, and external capsule were associated with higher SN-AI95 at 1 year. SN-AI95 was an independent contributor of poor motor outcome (Box and Block Test, \u03b2 = -.62 points; P = .01). Conclusion In patients with stroke, greater substantia nigra R2*, likely reflective of greater iron content, can be observed at 1 year ipsilateral from remote infarcts of specific location, which is associated with worse motor function. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Background Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promising results for cancer detection with mammographic screening. However, evidence related to the use of AI in real screening settings remain sparse. Purpose To compare the performance of a commercially available AI system with routine, independent double reading with consensus as performed in a population-based screening program. Furthermore, the histopathologic characteristics of tumors with different AI scores were explored. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, 122 969 screening examinations from 47 877 women performed at four screening units in BreastScreen Norway from October 2009 to December 2018 were included. The data set included 752 screen-detected cancers (6.1 per 1000 examinations) and 205 interval cancers (1.7 per 1000 examinations). Each examination had an AI score between 1 and 10, where 1 indicated low risk of breast cancer and 10 indicated high risk. Threshold 1, threshold 2, and threshold 3 were used to assess the performance of the AI system as a binary decision tool (selected vs not selected). Threshold 1 was set at an AI score of 10, threshold 2 was set to yield a selection rate similar to the consensus rate (8.8%), and threshold 3 was set to yield a selection rate similar to an average individual radiologist (5.8%). Descriptive statistics were used to summarize screening outcomes. Results A total of 653 of 752 screen-detected cancers (86.8%) and 92 of 205 interval cancers (44.9%) were given a score of 10 by the AI system (threshold 1). Using threshold 3, 80.1% of the screen-detected cancers (602 of 752) and 30.7% of the interval cancers (63 of 205) were selected. Screen-detected cancer with AI scores not selected using the thresholds had favorable histopathologic characteristics compared to those selected; opposite results were observed for interval cancer. Conclusion The proportion of screen-detected cancers not selected by the artificial intelligence (AI) system at the three evaluated thresholds was less than 20%. The overall performance of the AI system was promising according to cancer detection. \u00a9 RSNA, 2022.",
        "Background: Renal volume at sonography theoretically reflects the functional capacity of\r\nthe kidney which could be equivalent to glomerular filtration rate. The increasing burden of chronic renal diseases is alarming and has assumed epidemic proportions in resource poor settings, especially Africa, Nigeria included; consequently, efforts to reduce the cost of detecting, monitoring and managing chronic renal disease are imperative. Hence, ultrasonography provides a reliable, reproducible, cost-effective and readily accessible method of evaluating renal status. This was the thrust of this study, which sought to investigate the relationship between sonographically determined renal volume and functional capacity of the kidney represented by the estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR).\r\nAims and objectives: To determine the relationship between sonographic renal volume and renal function as assessed by the estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) as well as the relationship between sonographic renal volume and anthropometric measurements in normal adult population in Calabar.\r\nMethodology: A cross sectional prospective study design was employed, with recruitment of healthy subjects visiting or working in the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital using the simple random sampling method. Following researcher-administration of structured questionnaire with the inclusion and exclusion criteria adhered to; anthropometric data was obtained. Point of care serum creatinine values were obtained and utilized for estimation of GFR using Cockcroft Gault (CG) equation. Renal ultrasonography was then done for each of the consenting subjects.\r\nResults: Data was obtained from hundred (400) subjects with a female: male ratio of 1: 0.65, and mean age of 35.2 \u00b1 10.5 years, ranging from 18-80 years. Mean renal length was 9.81 \u00b10.87 and 10.34 \u00b10.87 cm; mean AP diameter was 3.95 \u00b10.40 cm and 4.28 \u00b10.42 cm; mean renal width was 4.99\u00b10.51 and 5.31 \u00b10.47 cm and mean renal volume was 102.11 \u00b1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n22.41cm3 and 124.07 \u00b125.22 cm3; Serum creatinine was 0.96 \u00b1 0.17 and 1.10 \u00b1 0.20mg/dl; Mean eGFR using CG equation was 91.43 \u00b123.09 and 96.13 \u00b120.3mL/min/1.73m2, for right and left respectively. The renal dimensions were generally larger in males than females.\r\nConclusion: This study shows a positive relationship between renal volume and eGFR ,body weight and BMI with implication for diagnostic and prognostic renal evaluation in our environment, especially for Nigerian adults living in the south south region.Keywords: Chronic renal disease, renal volume, Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate, Ultrasonography",

Typical CT findings included bilateral pulmonary parenchymal ground-glass and consolidative pulmonary opacities, sometimes with a rounded morphology and a peripheral lung distribution. Notably, lung cavitation, discrete pulmonary nodules, pleural effusions, and lymphadenopathy were absent. Follow-up imaging in a subset of patients during the study time window often demonstrated mild or moderate progression of disease, as manifested by increasing extent and density of lung opacities. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020",
        "History A 3-month-old previously healthy girl presented to an outside institution with a 4-day history of low-grade fever, irritability, and a tender \"knot\" in the upper abdomen. Ultrasonography (US) was performed at an outside hospital. US images were not available for review; however, they showed a mass in the left hepatic lobe, per the outside report, and the patient was referred to our institution for further evaluation. Her parents reported a normal full-term pregnancy, with regular prenatal care and normal prenatal US findings. The baby was born after an uncomplicated gestation. She was delivered at term via an uncomplicated cesarean section due to a maternal history of cesarean section. The perinatal course was uncomplicated, and there was no history of umbilical catheterization, per the parents. On arrival at our institution, the patient had a temperature of 38.2\u00b0C. All other vital signs were normal. Palpation revealed a tender and firm mass in the periumbilical region; otherwise, physical examination findings were normal. Results of laboratory work-up were normal, except for elevated white blood cell count (26 600/mm3 [26.6 \u00d7 109/L]; normal, 6000-17 500/mm3 [6-17.5 \u00d7 109/L]).

        "Purpose To determine the accuracy of imaging features, such as tumor dimension, multinodularity, nonsmooth tumor margins, peritumoral enhancement, and radiogenomic algorithm based on the association between imaging features (internal arteries and hypoattenuating halos) and gene expression that the authors called two-trait predictor of venous invasion (TTPVI), in the prediction of microvascular invasion (MVI) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Materials and Methods This single-center retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and the requirement for informed consent was waived. One hundred twenty-five patients (median age, 63 years; interquartile range, 53\u201371 years) with a diagnosis of HCC and indications for hepatic resection were included. Two observers independently reviewed radiologic images to evaluate the following features for MVI: maximum diameter, number of lesions, tumor margins, TTPVI, and peritumoral enhancement. Interobserver agreement was checked, and diagnostic accuracy of radiologic features was investigated. Results The total number of HCC nodules was 140. Large tumor size, nonsmooth tumor margins, TTPVI, and peritumoral enhancement were significantly related to the presence of MVI (P < .05 in all cases and for both observers). Multinodularity was not significantly related (P = .158). Moreover, the diagnostic accuracy of the three \"worrisome\" radiologic features (nonsmooth tumor margins, peritumoral enhancement, and TTPVI) was associated with tumor size: The negative predictive value of the absence of worrisome features decreased from 0.84 for observer 1 and 0.91 for observer 2 for tumors smaller than 2 cm to 0.56 and 0.71, respectively, for tumors larger than 5 cm, whereas the presence of all three worrisome features returned to a positive predictive value of 0.95 for observer 1 and 0.96 for observer 2 independent of tumor size, with no significant interobserver differences (P > .10). Conclusion \"Worrisome\" imaging features, such as tumor dimension, nonsmooth tumor margins, peritumoral enhancement, and TTPVI, have high accuracy in the prediction of MVI in HCC. \u00a9 RSNA, 2015 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "8SUMMARYINTRODUCTION / BACKGROUNDUltrasonography is an important tool in assessing gallbladder function and disorder in diabetics, bearing in mind neuropathy which is one of the long time complications, especially in type II diabetes mellitus (DM), which may affect gall bladder tone and emptying. This study evaluated gallbladder (GB) changes (fasting and postprandial) in type II DM using ultrasonography.AIMS AND OBJECTIVESEvaluating gallbladder volume and contractility index in this patients, as well as determining if there is any correlation with duration of DM and associated gall bladder stone.METHODSA prospective sonographic evaluation of the gall bladder in fasted and 45min postprandial 100 type II DM subjects ( 50 subjects with neuropathy and 50 without neuropathy ), as well as control normal healthy individuals was carried out in the Radiology department of Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital Complex (OAUTHC), Ile-Ife.DATA ANALYSISData obtained from this study was analyzed using the SPSS (version 16.0) The continuous variables were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation and student t-test was used for comparison between the subject groups to determine if there was statistical significance (p<0.05).9RESULTSDiabetic patients with neuropathy had the highest mean gallbladder volume compare to those without neuropathy and control group. The mean postprandial gall bladder volume was also highest in diabetics with neuropathy. The gallbladder ejection fraction was lowest in diabetics with neuropathy compare to those without neuropathy and control group. Longer duration of illness and doubled prevalence of gall stone is noted in diabetics with neuropathy compare to those without neuropathy and control group.CONCLUSIONThis study revealed that significant number of patients with type II DM has gall bladder abnormalities ranging from increase gall bladder volume to reduced ejection fraction (GBCI) with associated increase prevalence of gall stone disease. This is seen to be worse off in diabetics with neuropathy. Association also was established between duration of diabetes and gall bladder abnormalities.RECOMMENDATIONUltrasonography of the gall bladder therefore is highly recommended in type II DM patient management especially in those with long duration of illness as this will aid proactive management of gall bladder complication which they are prone to, and reduce morbidity and mortality.",
        "History A 1-year-old boy was referred for cochlear implant assessment after he received a diagnosis of bilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss at neonatal hearing screening shortly after birth. The child was born at term via uneventful delivery, and there was no history of familial hearing loss or maternal illness. Tympanic membranes were normal, and hearing loss was confirmed with auditory brainstem testing, which showed no response from either ear. Hearing aids were provided from 3 months of age, but no behavioral responses were noted when these were worn. He was also noted to have some mild developmental delay throughout his 1st year of life and was slow to crawl, roll over, and stand up. Physical examination showed no syndromic features or physical abnormalities. Ophthalmology confirmed normal vision and visual movements but bilateral anesthetic corneas. He had corneal abrasions due to minor repeated corneal trauma, and left-sided tarsorraphy was performed at 6 months. Facial nerve function, swallow, and voice quality were normal. To assess suitability for a cochlear implant, the patient underwent MRI of the temporal lobe and brain ( Figs 1 - 4 ) and thin-section CT of the temporal bones ( Figs 5 , 6 ). The patient subsequently underwent left cochlear implantation. Figure 1: Sagittal midline T1-weighted 1.5-T MR image (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 541/15).

        "Background The chest CT manifestations of COVID-19 from hospitalization to convalescence after 1 year are unknown. Purpose To assess chest CT manifestations of COVID-19 up to 1 year after symptom onset. Materials and Methods Patients were enrolled if they were admitted to the hospital because of COVID-19 and underwent CT during hospitalization at two isolation centers between January 27, 2020, and March 31, 2020. In a prospective study, three serial chest CT scans were obtained at approximately 3, 7, and 12 months after symptom onset and were longitudinally analyzed. The total CT score of pulmonary lobe involvement, ranging from 0 to 25, was assessed (score of 1\u20135 for each lobe). Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to explore independent risk factors for residual CT abnormalities after 1 year. Results A total of 209 study participants (mean age, 49 years \u00b1 13 [standard deviation]; 116 women) were evaluated. CT abnormalities had resolved in 61% of participants (128 of 209) at 3 months and in 75% of participants (156 of 209) at 12 months. Among participants with chest CT abnormalities that had not resolved, there were residual linear opacities in 25 of the 209 participants (12%) and multifocal reticular or cystic lesions in 28 of the 209 participants (13%). Age 50 years or older, lymphopenia, and severe or aggravation of acute respiratory distress syndrome were independent risk factors for residual CT abnormalities at 1 year (odds ratios = 15.9, 18.9, and 43.9, respectively; P < .001 for each comparison). In 53 participants with residual CT abnormalities at 12 months, reticular lesions (41 of 53 participants [77%]) and bronchial dilation (39 of 53 participants [74%]) were observed at discharge and were persistent in 28 (53%) and 24 (45%) of the 53 participants, respectively. Conclusion One year after COVID-19 diagnosis, chest CT scans showed abnormal findings in 53 of the 209 study participants (25%), with 28 of the 209 participants (13%) showing subpleural reticular or cystic lesions. Older participants with severe COVID-19 or acute respiratory distress syndrome were more likely to develop lung sequelae that persisted at 1 year. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Purpose To determine whether repeated exposure of the pediatric brain to a linear gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) is associated with an increase in signal intensity (SI) relative to that in GBCA-naive control subjects at unenhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Materials and Methods This single-center, retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board and compliant with HIPAA. The authors evaluated 46 pediatric patients who had undergone at least three GBCA-enhanced MR examinations (30 patients for two-group analysis and 16 for pre- and post-GBCA exposure comparisons) and 57 age-matched GBCA-naive control subjects. The SI in the globus pallidus, thalamus, dentate nucleus, and pons was measured at unenhanced T1-weighted MR imaging. Globus pallidus-thalamus and dentate nucleus-pons SI ratios were calculated and compared between groups and relative to total cumulative gadolinium dose, age, sex, and number of and mean time between GBCA-enhanced examinations. Analysis included the Wilcoxon signed rank test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, and Spearman correlation coefficient. Results Patients who underwent multiple GBCA-enhanced examinations had increased SI ratios within the dentate nucleus (mean SI ratio \u00b1 standard error of the mean for two-group comparison: 1.007 \u00b1 0.0058 for GBCA-naive group and 1.046 \u00b1 0.0060 for GBCA-exposed group [P < .001]; mean SI ratio for pre- and post-GBCA comparison: 0.995 \u00b1 0.0062 for pre-GBCA group and 1.035 \u00b1 0.0063 for post-GBCA group [P < .001]) but not the globus pallidus (mean SI ratio for two-group comparison: 1.131 \u00b1 0.0070 for GBCA-naive group and 1.014 \u00b1 0.0091 for GBCA-exposed group [P = .21]; mean SI ratio for pre- and post-GBCA comparison: 1.068 \u00b1 0.0094 for pre-GBCA group and 1.093 \u00b1 0.0134 for post-GBCA group [P = .12]). There was a significant correlation between dentate nucleus SI and total cumulative gadolinium dose (r = 0.4; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.03, 0.67; P = .03), but not between dentate nucleus SI and patient age (r = 0.23; 95% CI: -0.15, 0.56; P = .22), sex (mean SI ratio: 1.046 \u00b1 0.0072 for boys and 1.045 \u00b1 0.0110 for girls; P = .88), number of contrast-enhanced examinations (r = 0.13; 95% CI: -0.25, 0.48; P = .49), or time between contrast-enhanced examinations (r = -0.06; 95% CI: -0.42, 0.32; P = .75).

        "To document utility of shear-wave (SW) elastography for assessing liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis B and to compare its performance with that of transient elastography.Ethics committee approved the study, and informed consent was obtained. Patients with liver biopsy correlation (n = 226) and healthy patients (n = 171) were analyzed. Results of SW elastography of liver, SW elastography of spleen, and transient elastography of liver were compared and correlated according to METAVIR scores. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs), binary logistic regression, and Delong test were used.AUC for SW elastography of liver, transient elastography of liver, and SW elastography of spleen was, respectively, 0.86, 0.80, and 0.81 for fibrosis (\u2265 F1 stage); 0.88, 0.78, and 0.82 for moderate fibrosis (\u2265 F2 stage); 0.93, 0.83, and 0.83 for severe fibrosis (\u2265 F3 stage); and 0.98, 0.92, and 0.84 for cirrhosis (F4 stage). SW elastography of liver showed significantly higher accuracy than transient elastography of liver and SW elastography of spleen in all fibrosis stages (P = .01-.04). SW elastography of spleen showed similar accuracy with transient elastography of liver (P = .21-.99). Combination SW elastography of liver and SW elastography of spleen to predict fibrosis staging showed diagnostic accuracy not further improved compared with SW elastography of liver alone (similar AUC; \u2265 F1, P = .87; \u2265 F2, P = .81; \u2265 F3, P = .84; \u2265 F4, P = .88). SW elastography of liver had higher successful rate than transient elastography of liver (98.9% vs 89.6%). Prevalence of discordance in at least two stages with liver histologic staging was 10.2% (23 of 226) for SW elastography of liver and 28.2% (58 of 206) for SW elastography of spleen.SW elastography provides more accurate correlation of liver elasticity with liver fibrosis stage compared with transient elastography, especially in identification of stage F2 or greater.",
        "To compare the performance of multiphase computed tomographic (CT) enterography with that of capsule endoscopy in a group of patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB).This prospective HIPAA-compliant study was approved by the institutional review board and the institutional conflict of interest committee. All patients provided written informed consent. Two radiologists, blinded to clinical data and results of capsule endoscopy, interpreted images from CT enterography independently, with discordant interpretations resolved by consensus. Results were compared with those from a reference standard (surgery or endoscopy) and clinical follow-up. Sensitivity and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each modality.Fifty-eight adult patients, referred for the evaluation of OGIB (occult, 25 patients [43%]; overt, 33 patients [57%]), underwent both tests. A small bowel bleeding source was identified in 16 of the 58 patients (28%). The sensitivity of CT enterography was significantly greater than that of capsule endoscopy (88% [14 of 16 patients] vs 38% [six of 16 patients], respectively; P = .008), largely because it depicted more small bowel masses (100% [nine of nine patients] vs 33% [three of nine patients], respectively; P = .03). No additional small bowel tumors were discovered during the follow-up period (range, 5.6-45.9 months; mean, 16.6 months).In this referral population, the sensitivity of CT enterography for detecting small bowel bleeding sources and small bowel masses was significantly greater than that of capsule endoscopy. On the basis of these findings, the addition of multiphase CT enterography to the routine diagnostic work-up of patients with OGIB should be considered, particularly in patients with negative findings at capsule endoscopy.",
        "Purpose To evaluate ability of radiomic (computer-extracted imaging) features to distinguish non-small cell lung cancer adenocarcinomas from granulomas at noncontrast CT. Materials and Methods For this retrospective study, screening or standard diagnostic noncontrast CT images were collected for 290 patients (mean age, 68 years; range, 18\u201392 years; 125 men [mean age, 67 years; range, 18\u201390 years] and 165 women [mean age, 68 years; range, 33\u201392 years]) from two institutions between 2007 and 2013. Histopathologic analysis was available for one nodule per patient. Corresponding nodule of interest was identified on axial CT images by a radiologist with manual annotation. Nodule shape, wavelet (Gabor), and texture-based (Haralick and Laws energy) features were extracted from intra- and perinodular regions. Features were pruned to train machine learning classifiers with 145 patients. In a test set of 145 patients, classifier results were compared against a convolutional neural network (CNN) and diagnostic readings of two radiologists. Results Support vector machine classifier with intranodular radiomic features achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.75 on the test set. Combining radiomics of intranodular with perinodular regions improved the AUC to 0.80. On the same test set, CNN resulted in an AUC of 0.76. Radiologist readers achieved AUCs of 0.61 and 0.60, respectively. Conclusion Radiomic features from intranodular and perinodular regions of nodules can distinguish non-small cell lung cancer adenocarcinomas from benign granulomas at noncontrast CT. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Purpose To study the effects of the surrounding electrical microenvironment and local tissue parameters on the electrical parameters and outcome of irreversible electroporation (IRE) ablation in porcine muscle, kidney, and liver tissue. Materials and Methods Animal Care and Use Committee approval was obtained, and National Institutes of Health guidelines were followed. IRE ablation (n = 90) was applied in muscle (n = 44), kidney (n = 28), and liver (n = 18) tissue in 18 pigs. Two electrodes with tip exposure of 1.5\u20132 cm were used at varying voltages (1500\u20133000 V), pulse repetitions (n = 70\u2013100), pulse length (70\u2013100 \u00b5sec), and electrode spacing (1.5\u20132 cm). In muscle tissue, electrodes were placed exactly parallel, in plane, or perpendicular to paraspinal muscle fibers; in kidney tissue, in the cortex or adjacent to the renal medulla; and in liver tissue, with and without metallic or plastic plates placed 1\u20132 cm from electrodes. Ablation zones were determined at gross pathologic (90\u2013120 minutes after IRE) and immunohistopathologic examination (6 hours after) for apoptosis and heat-shock protein markers. Multivariate analysis of variance with multiple comparisons and/or paired t tests and regression analysis were used for analysis. Results Mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) ablation zones in muscle were 6.2 cm \u00b1 0.3 \u00d7 4.2 cm \u00b1 0.3 for parallel electrodes and 4.2 cm \u00b1 0.8 \u00d7 3.0 cm \u00b1 0.5 for in-plane application. Perpendicular orientation resulted in a cross-shaped zone. Orientation significantly affected IRE current applied (28.5\u201331.7A for parallel, 29.5\u201339.7A for perpendicular; P = .003). For kidney cortex, ovoid zones of 1.5 cm \u00b1 0.1 \u00d7 0.5 cm \u00b1 0.0 to 2.5 cm \u00b1 0.1 \u00d7 1.3 cm \u00b1 0.1 were seen. Placement of electrodes less than 5 mm from the medullary pyramids resulted in treatment effect arcing into the collecting system. For liver tissue, symmetric 2.7 cm \u00b1 0.2 \u00d7 1.4 cm \u00b1 0.3 coagulation areas were seen without the metallic plate but asymmetric coagulation was seen with the metallic plate. Conclusion IRE treatment zones are sensitive to varying electrical conductivity in tissues. Electrode location, orientation, and heterogeneities in local environment must be considered in planning ablation treatment. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To retrospectively compare image quality and radiation dose between a reduced-dose computed tomographic (CT) protocol that uses model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) and a standard-dose CT protocol that uses 30% adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) with filtered back projection. Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval was obtained. Clinical CT images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis obtained with a reduced-dose protocol were identified. Images were reconstructed with two algorithms: MBIR and 100% ASIR. All subjects had undergone standard-dose CT within the prior year, and the images were reconstructed with 30% ASIR. Reduced- and standard-dose images were evaluated objectively and subjectively. Reduced-dose images were evaluated for lesion detectability. Spatial resolution was assessed in a phantom. Radiation dose was estimated by using volumetric CT dose index (CTDIvol) and calculated size-specific dose estimates (SSDE). A combination of descriptive statistics, analysis of variance, and t tests was used for statistical analysis. Results In the 25 patients who underwent the reduced-dose protocol, mean decrease in CTDIvol was 46% (range, 19%\u201365%) and mean decrease in SSDE was 44% (range, 19%\u201364%). Reduced-dose MBIR images had less noise (P > .004). Spatial resolution was superior for reduced-dose MBIR images. Reduced-dose MBIR images were equivalent to standard-dose images for lungs and soft tissues (P > .05) but were inferior for bones (P = .004). Reduced-dose 100% ASIR images were inferior for soft tissues (P < .002), lungs (P < .001), and bones (P < .001). By using the same reduced-dose acquisition, lesion detectability was better (38% [32 of 84 rated lesions]) or the same (62% [52 of 84 rated lesions]) with MBIR as compared with 100% ASIR. Conclusion CT performed with a reduced-dose protocol and MBIR is feasible in the pediatric population, and it maintains diagnostic quality. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To evaluate the diagnostic potential of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM)-derived parameters for differentiation of common pancreatic tumors, chronic pancreatitis, and normal pancreas and for characterization of the malignancy potential of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs).The institutional review board approved this retrospective study, and informed consent was waived. Ninety-three consecutive patients with surgically resected and pathologically confirmed pancreatic tumors (39 pancreatic adenocarcinomas [PACs], 17 neuroendocrine tumors [NETs], and 37 IPMNs), seven patients with chronic pancreatitis, and 26 patients with a normal pancreas were included in this study. All patients underwent pancreatic 3.0-T magnetic resonance imaging, including IVIM diffusion-weighted imaging with 10 b values used (from 0 to 1000 sec/mm(2)). The ADC, slow component of diffusion (D(slow)), incoherent microcirculation (D(fast)), and perfusion fraction (f) were calculated. Steel-Dwass and Mann-Whitney U tests were used for comparison. The diagnostic performance of the parameters was evaluated by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis with Bonferroni correction.Among ADC- and IVIM-derived parameters, D(fast) and f values of PACs were significantly lower than those of normal pancreas, chronic pancreatitis, and NETs (all P < .05 in post hoc analyses). For differentiation of PACs from NETs, f and D(fast) showed a significant difference (P < .0001 for both) and were more useful parameters than ADC and D(slow) in ROC analysis (all P < .05). Malignant IPMNs had significantly lower ADC and D(slow) values and higher D(fast) and f values when compared with benign IPMNs (all P < .05). In ROC analysis, f showed the highest area under the ROC curve value for distinguishing malignant from benign IPMNs.IVIM-derived perfusion-related parameters could be helpful for the differentiation of common malignant tumors in the pancreas and for distinguishing malignant from benign IPMNs. D(fast) and f were more valuable parameters in the differentiation of PACs from NETs than were ADC and D(slow).",
        "Purpose To determine the association between tumor heterogeneity, morphologic tumor response, and overall survival in primary esophageal cancer treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy (CRT). Materials and Methods After an institutional review board waiver was obtained, contrast material\u2013enhanced computed tomographic (CT) studies in 36 patients with stage T2 or greater esophageal tumors who underwent contrast-enhanced CT before and after CRT between 2005 and 2008 were analyzed in terms of whole-tumor texture, with quantification of entropy, uniformity, mean gray-level intensity, kurtosis, standard deviation of the histogram, and skewness for fine to coarse textures (filters 1.0\u20132.5, respectively). The association between texture parameters and survival time was assessed by using Kaplan-Meier analysis and a Cox proportional hazards model. Survival models involving texture parameters and combinations of texture and morphologic response assessment were compared with morphologic assessment alone by means of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results Posttreatment medium entropy of less than 7.356 (median overall survival, 33.2 vs 11.7 months; P = .0002), coarse entropy of less than 7.116 (median overall survival, 33.2 vs 11.7 months; P = .0002), and medium uniformity of 0.007 or greater (median overall survival, 33.2 vs 11.7 months; P = .0002) were associated with improved survival time. These remained significant prognostic factors after adjustment for stage and age: entropy (filter 2.0: hazard ratio [HR] = 5.038, P = .0004; filter 2.5: HR = 5.038, P = .0004) and uniformity (HR = 0.199, P = .0004). Survival models that included a combination of pretreatment entropy and uniformity with maximal wall thickness assessment, respectively, performed better than morphologic assessment alone (area under the ROC curve, 0.767 vs 0.487 [P = .00005] and 0.802 vs 0.487 [P = .0003]). Conclusion Posttreatment texture parameters are associated with survival time, and the combination of pretreatment texture parameters and maximal wall thickness performed better in survival models than morphologic tumor response alone. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Background: Accurate clinical staging is crucial to managing gastrointestinal cancer, but fluorine 18 ( 18 F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT has limitations.Targeting fibroblast-activation protein is a newer diagnostic approach for the visualization of tumor stroma, and gallium 68 ( 68 Ga)-labeled fibroblast-activation protein inhibitors (FAPIs), hereafter 68 Ga-FAPIs, present a promising alternative to 18 F-FDG.Purpose: To compare the diagnostic efficacy of 68 Ga-FAPI PET/CT in primary and metastatic lesions of gastrointestinal malignancies with that of 18 F-FDG PET/CT. Materials and Methods:Images from patients with gastric, duodenal, and colorectal cancers who underwent contemporaneous 18 F-FDG and 68 Ga-FAPI PET/CT between October 2019 through June 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. 18F-FDG and 68 Ga-FAPI uptakes were compared by using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.The McNemar test was used to compare the diagnostic performance between the two techniques.Results: Thirty-five patients (median age, 64 years [interquartile range, 53-68 years]; 18 men) were evaluated.In treatment-naive patients (n = 19), 68 Ga-FAPI PET/CT led to upstaging of the clinical TNM stage in four (21%) patients compared with 18 F-FDG PET/CT.Tracer uptake was higher with 68 Ga-FAPI PET/CT than with 18 F-FDG PET/CT in primary lesions (gastric cancer: 12.7 vs 3.7, respectively, P = .003;colorectal cancer: 15.9 vs 7.9, P = .03),involved lymph nodes (6.7 vs 2.4, P , .001), and bone and visceral metastases (liver metastases: 9.7 vs 5.2, P , .001;peritoneal metastases: 8.4 vs 3.6, P , .001;bone metastases: 4.3 vs 2.2, P , .001;lung metastases: 4.4 vs 1.9, P = .01).In addition, the sensitivity of 68 Ga-FAPI PET/CT was higher than that of 18 F-FDG PET/CT in the detection of primary tumors (100% [19 of 19] vs 53% [10 of 19], respectively; P = .004),lymph nodes (79% [22 of 28] vs 54% [15 of 28], P , .001), and bone and visceral metastases (89% [31 of 35] vs 57% [20 of 35], P , .001). Conclusion:Gallium 68 fibroblast-activation protein inhibitor PET/CT was superior to fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT in the detection of primary and metastatic lesions in gastric, duodenal, and colorectal cancers, with higher tracer uptake in most primary and metastatic lesions.",
        "Purpose To evaluate the diagnostic performance and interrater reliability of the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) version 2014 in differentiating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from non-HCC malignancy in a population of patients at risk for HCC. Materials and Methods This retrospective HIPAA-compliant institutional review board-approved study was exempt from informed consent. A total of 178 pathology-proven malignant liver masses were identified in 178 patients at risk for HCC but without established extrahepatic malignancy from August 2012 through August 2015. Two readers blinded to pathology findings and clinical follow-up data independently evaluated a liver protocol magnetic resonance or computed tomography study for each lesion and assigned LI-RADS categories, scoring all major and most ancillary features. Statistical analyses included the independent samples t test, x2 test, Fisher exact test, and Cohen k. Results This study included 136 HCCs and 42 non-HCC malignancies. Specificity and positive predictive value of an HCC imaging diagnosis (LR-5 or LR-5V) were 69.0% and 90.5%, respectively, for reader 1 (R1) and 88.3% and 95.5%, respectively, for reader 2 (R2). Tumor in vein was a common finding in patients with non-HCC malignancies (R1, 10 of 42 [23.8%]; R2, five of 42 [11.9%]). Exclusion of the LR-5V pathway improved specificity and positive predictive value for HCC to 83.3% and 92.9%, respectively, for R1 (six fewer false-positive findings) and 92.3% and 96.4%, respectively, for R2 (one fewer false-positive finding). Among masses with arterial phase hyperenhancement, the rim pattern was more common among non-HCC malignancies than among HCCs for both readers (R1: 24 of 36 [66.7%] vs 13 of 124, [10.5%], P < .001; R2: 27 of 35 [77.1%] vs 21 of 123 [17.1%], P < .001) (k = 0.76). Exclusion of rim arterial phase hyperenhancement as a means of satisfying LR-5 criteria also improved specificity and positive predictive value for HCC (R1, two fewer false-positive findings). Conclusion Modification of the algorithmic role of tumor in vein and rim arterial phase hyperenhancement improves the diagnostic performance of LI-RADS version 2014 in differentiating HCC from non-HCC malignancy. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To evaluate the incremental value of using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in addition to T2-weighted imaging for the detection of prostate cancer in the transition zone and the assessment of tumor aggressiveness. Materials and Methods This retrospective HIPAA-compliant institutional review board\u2013approved study included 156 consecutive patients (median age, 59.2 years) who underwent MR imaging before radical prostatectomy. Two readers who were blinded to patient data independently recorded their levels of suspicion on a five-point scale of the presence of transition zone tumors on the basis of T2-weighted imaging alone and then, 4 weeks later, diffusion-weighted imaging and T2-weighted imaging together. Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) were measured in transition zone cancers and glandular and stromal benign prostatic hyperplasia. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were used to evaluate detection accuracy, and generalized linear models were used to test ADC differences between benign and malignant prostate regions. Whole-mount step-section histopathologic examination was the reference standard. Results In overall tumor detection, addition of diffusion-weighted imaging to T2-weighted imaging improved the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for readers 1 and 2 from 0.60 and 0.60 to 0.75 and 0.71, respectively, at the patient level (P = .004 for reader 1 and P = .027 for reader 2) and from 0.64 and 0.63 to 0.73 and 0.68, respectively, at the sextant level (P = .001 for reader 1 and P = .100 for reader 2). Least squares mean ADCs (\u00d7 10\u22123 mm2/sec) in glandular and stromal benign prostatic hyperplasia were 1.44 and 1.09, respectively. Mean ADCs were inversely associated with tumor Gleason scores (1.10, 0.98, 0.87, and 0.75 for Gleason scores of 3 + 3, 3 + 4, 4 + 3, and \u2265 4 + 4, respectively). Conclusion Use of diffusion-weighted imaging in addition to T2-weighted imaging improved detection of prostate cancer in the transition zone, and tumor ADCs were inversely associated with tumor Gleason scores in the transition zone. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "Purpose To characterize the relationship between aneurysm size and epidemiologic risk factors with growth and rupture by using computed tomographic (CT) angiography. Materials and Methods In this HIPAA-compliant, institutional review board approved study, patients with known asymptomatic unruptured intracerebral aneurysms were followed up longitudinally with CT angiographic examinations. Growth was defined as an increase in one or more dimensions above the measurement error, and at least 5% volume by using the ABC/2 method. Associations of epidemiologic factors with aneurysm growth and rupture were analyzed by using logistic regression analysis. Intra- and interobserver agreement coefficients for dimension, volume, and growth were evaluated by using the Pearson correlation coefficient and difference of means with 95% confidence intervals, the agreement statistic, and the McNemar \u03c72. Results Patients (n = 165) with aneurysms (n = 258) had a mean follow-up time of 2.24 years from time of diagnosis. Forty-six of 258 (18%) aneurysms in 38 patients grew larger. Spontaneous rupture occurred in four of 228 (1.8%) intradural aneurysms of average size (6.2 mm). Risk of aneurysm rupture per patient-year was 2.4% (95% CI: 0.5%, 7.12%) with growth and 0.2% (95% CI: 0.006%, 1.22%) without growth (P = .034). There was a 12-fold higher risk of rupture for growing aneurysms (P < .002), with high intra- and interobserver correlation coefficients for size, volume, and growth. Tobacco smoking (3.806, one degree of freedom; P < .015,) and initial size (5.895, two degrees of freedom; P < .051) were independent covariates, predicting 78.4% of growing aneurysms. Conclusion These results support imaging follow-up of all patients with aneurysms, including those whose aneurysms are smaller than the current 7-mm treatment threshold. Aneurysm growth, size, and smoking were associated with increased rupture risk. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "Purpose To determine computed tomographic (CT) features of primary graft nonfunction (PNF) after liver transplantation in comparison with those of early graft failure or death by identifiable causes. Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval was obtained and informed consent was waived. Among 3947 adult liver transplantations performed in one institution between May 2002 and May 2015, 72 patients died or had graft failure within 10 days, and 38 of them were evaluated with CT. PNF was diagnosed in 21 patients. The other 17 patients who died or had early graft failure were considered the non-PNF control group. On unenhanced CT images, graft attenuation was compared qualitatively. Graft attenuation was measured quantitatively and, if available, the difference between preoperative and postoperative CT (interval change) attenuation was evaluated. Unenhanced CT was evaluated for relative parenchymal enhancement. Statistical analyses included the Fisher exact and \u03c72 tests with Yates correction and the Student t test. Results On unenhanced CT images, grafts with PNF more commonly showed low (eight of 26 [31%]) or extremely low (18 of 26 [69%]) qualitative attenuation compared with grafts in the non-PNF group (three of 21 [14%], one of 21 [5%]; P < .001). The mean attenuation value (30.5 HU \u00b1 10.8) was significantly lower and the mean interval change (24.7 HU \u00b1 12.5) was significantly higher in the PNF group than in the non-PNF group (49.7 HU \u00b1 8.0 and 9.7 HU \u00b1 10.1, respectively; P < .001 and P = .001). There was no significant difference in the proportion of grafts that showed poor enhancement on postcontrast CT images between the PNF group and the non-PNF group (nine of 24 [38%] vs two of 20 [10%], respectively; P = .08). Conclusion Recipients with PNF after liver transplantation tended to show low or extremely low attenuation on unenhanced CT images, and this finding was seen more frequently in patients with PNF than in those who died of identifiable causes and in those with early graft failure. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Background Fluorine 18 (18F)-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT is a routine tool for staging patients with lymphoma and lung cancer. Purpose To evaluate configurations of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to localize and classify uptake patterns of whole-body 18F-FDG PET/CT images in patients with lung cancer and lymphoma. Materials and Methods This was a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients with lung cancer or lymphoma referred to a single center from August 2011 to August 2013. Two nuclear medicine experts manually delineated foci with increased 18F-FDG uptake, specified the anatomic location, and classified these findings as suspicious for tumor or metastasis or nonsuspicious. By using these expert readings as the reference standard, a CNN was developed to detect foci positive for 18F-FDG uptake, predict the anatomic location, and determine the expert classification. Examinations were divided into independent training (60%), validation (20%), and test (20%) subsets. Results This study included 629 patients (mean age, 52.2 years \u00b1 20.4 [standard deviation]; 394 men). There were 302 patients with lung cancer and 327 patients with lymphoma. For the test set (123 patients; 10 782 foci), the CNN areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) for determining hypermetabolic 18F-FDG PET/CT foci that were suspicious for cancer versus nonsuspicious by using the five input features were as follows: CT alone, 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.72, 0.83); 18F-FDG PET alone, 0.97 (95% CI: 0.97, 0.98); 18F-FDG PET/CT, 0.98 (95% CI: 0.97, 0.99); 18F-FDG PET/CT maximum intensity projection (MIP), 0.98 (95% CI: 0.98, 0.99); and 18F-FDG PET/CT MIP atlas, 0.99 (95% CI: 0.98, 1.00). The combination of 18F-FDG PET and CT information improved overall classification accuracy (AUC, 0.975 vs 0.981, respectively; P < .001). Anatomic localization accuracy of the CNN was 2543 of 2639 (96.4%; 95% CI: 95.5%, 97.1%) for body part, 2292 of 2639 (86.9%; 95% CI: 85.3%, 88.5%) for region (ie, organ), and 2149 of 2639 (81.4%; 95% CI: 79.3%-83.5%) for subregion. Conclusion The fully automated anatomic localization and classification of fluorine 18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET uptake patterns in foci suspicious and nonsuspicious for cancer in patients with lung cancer and lymphoma by using a convolutional neural network is feasible and achieves high diagnostic performance when both CT and PET images are used. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "HistoryA 34-year-old man presented to the emergency department of our hospital for progressive shortness of breath and worsening productive cough of 2 weeks duration. He reported a 10-kg weight loss over 4 months but denied experiencing fever, chills, night sweats, or gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, or neurologic symptoms. His medical history was unremarkable. Although he was a native of Morocco, he had lived in Europe for many years and worked as a truck driver. The patient had a smoking history but had quit smoking 5 years prior to presentation. He denied alcohol abuse or recreational drug use. He did not have any allergies. Besides bilateral clubbing, the physical examination findings were normal. At the time of admission, he had an oxygen (O2) saturation of 87% at ambient air, which increased to 100% with 1 L of O2 administered via a nasal cannula. The blood sample revealed a slight increase in his hemoglobin concentration (18.7 g/dL; normal range, 13.6-17.2 g/dL) and hematocrit level (50.8%; normal range, 39%-49%). His inflammatory parameters were normal, as were his hepatic and renal function. The arterial blood gas test showed partially compensated pulmonary alkalosis (pH, 7.43; normal range, 7.35-7.42; PCO2, 26 mmHg; normal range, 38-42 mmHg; PO2, 89 mmHg; normal range, 75-100 mmHg; bicarbonate level, 17 mEq/L [17 mmol/L]; normal range 22-26 mEq/L [22-26 mmol/L]). The results of the pulmonary function tests were expressed as the percentage of predicted values and were 92% for forced vital capacity, 93% for forced expiratory volume in 1 second, 116% for total lung capacity, and 60% for diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide. Anteroposterior chest radiography and enhanced chest CT were also performed at admission.",
        "Purpose To investigate whether nonhemodynamic resonant saturation effects can be detected in patients with focal epilepsy by using a phase-cycled stimulus-induced rotary saturation (PC-SIRS) approach with spin-lock (SL) preparation and whether they colocalize with the seizure onset zone and surface interictal epileptiform discharges (IED). Materials and Methods The study was approved by the local ethics committee, and all subjects gave written informed consent. Eight patients with focal epilepsy undergoing presurgical surface and intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging at 3 T with a whole-brain PC-SIRS imaging sequence with alternating SL-on and SL-off and two-dimensional echo-planar readout. The power of the SL radiofrequency pulse was set to 120 Hz to sensitize the sequence to high gamma oscillations present in epileptogenic tissue. Phase cycling was applied to capture distributed current orientations. Voxel-wise subtraction of SL-off from SL-on images enabled the separation of T2* effects from rotary saturation effects. The topography of PC-SIRS effects was compared with the seizure onset zone at intracranial EEG and with surface IED-related potentials. Bayesian statistics were used to test whether prior PC-SIRS information could improve IED source reconstruction. Results Nonhemodynamic resonant saturation effects ipsilateral to the seizure onset zone were detected in six of eight patients (concordance rate, 0.75; 95% confidence interval: 0.40, 0.94) by means of the PC-SIRS technique. They were concordant with IED surface negativity in seven of eight patients (0.88; 95% confidence interval: 0.51, 1.00). Including PC-SIRS as prior information improved the evidence of the standard EEG source models compared with the use of uninformed reconstructions (exceedance probability, 0.77 vs 0.12; Wilcoxon test of model evidence, P < .05). Nonhemodynamic resonant saturation effects resolved in patients with favorable postsurgical outcomes, but persisted in patients with postsurgical seizure recurrence. Conclusion Nonhemodynamic resonant saturation effects are detectable during interictal periods with the PC-SIRS approach in patients with epilepsy. The method may be useful for MR imaging-based detection of neuronal currents in a clinical environment. (\u00a9) RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To test the hypothesis-given the increasing emphasis on quantitative computed tomographic (CT) phenotypes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-that a relationship exists between COPD exacerbation frequency and quantitative CT measures of emphysema and airway disease.This research protocol was approved by the institutional review board of each participating institution, and all participants provided written informed consent. One thousand two subjects who were enrolled in the COPDGene Study and met the GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) criteria for COPD with quantitative CT analysis were included. Total lung emphysema percentage was measured by using the attenuation mask technique with a -950-HU threshold. An automated program measured the mean wall thickness and mean wall area percentage in six segmental bronchi. The frequency of COPD exacerbation in the prior year was determined by using a questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed to examine the relationship of exacerbation frequency with lung function and quantitative CT measurements.In a multivariate analysis adjusted for lung function, bronchial wall thickness and total lung emphysema percentage were associated with COPD exacerbation frequency. Each 1-mm increase in bronchial wall thickness was associated with a 1.84-fold increase in annual exacerbation rate (P = .004). For patients with 35% or greater total emphysema, each 5% increase in emphysema was associated with a 1.18-fold increase in this rate (P = .047).Greater lung emphysema and airway wall thickness were associated with COPD exacerbations, independent of the severity of airflow obstruction. Quantitative CT can help identify subgroups of patients with COPD who experience exacerbations for targeted research and therapy development for individual phenotypes.",
        "Purpose To investigate relationships between computer-extracted breast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging phenotypes with multigene assays of MammaPrint, Oncotype DX, and PAM50 to assess the role of radiomics in evaluating the risk of breast cancer recurrence. Materials and Methods Analysis was conducted on an institutional review board-approved retrospective data set of 84 deidentified, multi-institutional breast MR examinations from the National Cancer Institute Cancer Imaging Archive, along with clinical, histopathologic, and genomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The data set of biopsy-proven invasive breast cancers included 74 (88%) ductal, eight (10%) lobular, and two (2%) mixed cancers. Of these, 73 (87%) were estrogen receptor positive, 67 (80%) were progesterone receptor positive, and 19 (23%) were human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive. For each case, computerized radiomics of the MR images yielded computer-extracted tumor phenotypes of size, shape, margin morphology, enhancement texture, and kinetic assessment. Regression and receiver operating characteristic analysis were conducted to assess the predictive ability of the MR radiomics features relative to the multigene assay classifications. Results Multiple linear regression analyses demonstrated significant associations (R2 = 0.25-0.32, r = 0.5-0.56, P < .0001) between radiomics signatures and multigene assay recurrence scores. Important radiomics features included tumor size and enhancement texture, which indicated tumor heterogeneity. Use of radiomics in the task of distinguishing between good and poor prognosis yielded area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 0.88 (standard error, 0.05), 0.76 (standard error, 0.06), 0.68 (standard error, 0.08), and 0.55 (standard error, 0.09) for MammaPrint, Oncotype DX, PAM50 risk of relapse based on subtype, and PAM50 risk of relapse based on subtype and proliferation, respectively, with all but the latter showing statistical difference from chance. Conclusion Quantitative breast MR imaging radiomics shows promise for image-based phenotyping in assessing the risk of breast cancer recurrence. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To establish the reference range for hepatic attenuation minus splenic attenuation difference (CT(L-S)) values on nonenhanced computed tomographic (CT) images obtained in adults with a biopsy-proved nonsteatotic liver and determine the CT(L-S) criterion for diagnosing hepatic steatosis.This retrospective study was institutional review board approved, and all subjects had provided written informed consent. The CT(L-S) was measured in 315 liver donor candidates (207 men, 108 women; mean age, 31.5 years \u00b1 10.1 [standard deviation]) who underwent nonenhanced CT of the liver and subsequent ultrasonographically guided liver biopsy on the same day. Nonenhanced liver CT was performed with a 16-section multidetector scanner in 154 individuals and with a 64-section multidetector scanner in 161 individuals. Biopsy specimens were analyzed for degree of hepatic steatosis and iron deposition. The CT(L-S) reference range was determined according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guideline C28-A3 in individuals with a histologically proved nonsteatotic liver. The sensitivity of nonenhanced CT for the diagnosis of 5% or greater and 30% or greater hepatic steatosis with use of the lower limit of the reference range as the diagnostic cutoff was determined. The effects of subject age and sex, CT scanner type, and hepatic iron on the CT(L-S) were evaluated by using multiple linear regression analysis.Ninety-six subjects (48 men, 48 women) were found to have a histologically proved nonsteatotic liver, with an estimated reference range for CT(L-S) values of 1-18 HU. With a CT(L-S) of less than 1 HU as the criterion for hepatic steatosis, the sensitivities of nonenhanced CT for 5% or greater and 30% or greater hepatic steatosis were 18.6% (29 of 156 subjects) and 67% (26 of 39 subjects), respectively. Subject age had a significant but negligible effect on CT(L-S) (0.076-HU increase per year of age, P = .009), subject sex and scanner type had no effects on CT(L-S), and hepatic iron deposition significantly increased the CT(L-S) (1.434-HU increase per increase in iron deposition grade, P = .011).The histologically proved reference range of CT(L-S) values for nonsteatotic livers was 1-18 HU. A CT(L-S) of less than 1 HU could be used as a conservative criterion for diagnosing hepatic steatosis with nonenhanced CT more consistently.",
        "Background Radiomics-based biomarkers enable the prognostication of resected non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but their effectiveness in clinical stage and pathologic stage IA pure-solid tumors requires further determination. Purpose To construct an efficient radiomics signature for survival risk stratification personalized for patients with clinical stage and pathologic stage IA pure-solid NSCLC. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, six radiomics signatures were constructed for patients with stage IA pure-solid NSCLC who underwent resection between January 2011 and December 2013 at authors' institution and were tested in the radiogenomics data set. The radiomics features were extracted from the intratumoral two-dimensional region, three-dimensional volume, and peritumoral area using PyRadiomics. The discriminative abilities of the signatures were quantified using the area under the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and the optimal signature was selected for patient stratification. Results The study included 592 patients with stage IA pure-solid NSCLC (median age, 61 years; interquartile range, 55\u201366 years; 269 women) for radiomics analysis: 381 patients for training, 163 for internal validation, and 48 for external validation. The radiomics signature combining three-region features yielded the highest 3- and 5-year AUCs of 0.77 and 0.78, respectively, in the internal validation set and 0.76 and 0.75, respectively, in the external validation set. Multivariable analysis suggested that the radiomics signature remained an independent prognostic factor (hazard ratio, 6.2; 95% CI: 3.5, 11.0; P < .001) and improved the discriminative ability and clinical usefulness of conventional clinical predictors. Conclusion The radiomics signature with multiregional features helped stratify the survival risk of patients with clinical stage and pathologic stage IA pure-solid non\u2013small cell lung cancer.

        "Purpose To test the hypothesis that whole-body metabolic tumor burden (MTBWB) on postsurgical fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomographic (PET)/computed tomographic (CT) images in patients with non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is associated with their overall survival (OS). Materials and Methods The institutional review board approved this study and waived the requirement for obtaining informed consent. One hundred forty-two patients with NSCLC (69 men, 73 women; median age, 67.7 years) who underwent postsurgical FDG PET/CT were retrospectively reviewed. The whole-body metabolic tumor volume (MTVWB), whole-body total lesion glycolysis (TLGWB), and whole-body maximum standardized uptake value (SUVWBmax) were measured. OS served as the primary end point of the study. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression were used to assess the association between PET/CT markers and OS. Results The interobserver variability was low, as demonstrated with intraclass correlation coefficients higher than 0.94 for SUVWBmax, MTVWB, and TLGWB. When compared with those with negative postsurgical FDG PET/CT findings, a significant decrease of OS was found in patients with the presence of FDG-avid tumor on the basis of both a log-rank test (P = .001) and a univariate Cox model (hazard ratio = 2.805, P = .001). In patients with FDG-avid tumor, there was a significant association between OS and ln MTVWB (P < .001), ln TLGWB (P < .001), and ln SUVWBmax (P < .010) in either univariate or multivariate analysis, after adjusting for patient age, sex, TNM restage, and therapy after postsurgical PET/CT studies. The OS differences between the groups dichotomized by the median value of MTVWB (11.54 mL, P = .004), TLGWB (32.38 mL, P < .001), or SUVWBmax (4.93, P = .023) were significant. Conclusion MTBWB and tumor maximum standardized uptake at postsurgical FDG PET/CT are related to the patient's OS in NSCLC, independent of age, sex, TNM restaging, and therapy after postsurgical PET/CT studies. \u00a9 RSNA, 2015",
        "To prospectively evaluate the diagnostic contribution of mammography with synchrotron radiation in patients with questionable or suspicious breast abnormalities identified at combined digital mammography (DM) and ultrasonography (US).The ethics committee approved this prospective study, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Mammography with synchrotron radiation was performed with a phase-detection technique at a synchrotron radiation laboratory. Forty-nine women who met at least one of the inclusion criteria (palpable mass, focal asymmetry, architectural distortion, or equivocal or suspicious mass at DM; none clarified at US) were enrolled. Forty-seven women (mean age, 57.8 years \u00b1 8.8 [standard deviation]; age range, 43-78 years) completed the study protocol, which involved biopsy or follow-up for 1 year as the reference standard. Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) scores of 1-3 were considered to indicate a negative result, while scores 4-5 were considered to indicate a positive result. The visibility of breast abnormalities and the glandular parenchymal structure at DM and at mammography with synchrotron radiation was compared by using the Wilcoxon signed rank test.In 29 of the 31 patients with a final diagnosis of benign entity, mammography with synchrotron radiation yielded BI-RADS scores of 1-3. In 13 of the remaining 16 patients with a final diagnosis of malignancy, mammography with synchrotron radiation yielded BI-RADS scores of 4-5. Therefore, a sensitivity of 81% (13 of 16 patients) and a specificity of 94% (29 of 31 patients) were achieved with use of the described BI-RADS dichotomization system.These study results suggest that mammography with synchrotron radiation can be used to clarify cases of questionable or suspicious breast abnormalities identified at DM.http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.11100745/-/DC1.",
        "Purpose To compare breast cancer detection performance of radiologists reading mammographic examinations unaided versus supported by an artificial intelligence (AI) system. Materials and Methods An enriched retrospective, fully crossed, multireader, multicase, HIPAA-compliant study was performed. Screening digital mammographic examinations from 240 women (median age, 62 years; range, 39-89 years) performed between 2013 and 2017 were included. The 240 examinations (100 showing cancers, 40 leading to false-positive recalls, 100 normal) were interpreted by 14 Mammography Quality Standards Act-qualified radiologists, once with and once without AI support. The readers provided a Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System score and probability of malignancy. AI support provided radiologists with interactive decision support (clicking on a breast region yields a local cancer likelihood score), traditional lesion markers for computer-detected abnormalities, and an examination-based cancer likelihood score. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), specificity and sensitivity, and reading time were compared between conditions by using mixed-models analysis dof variance and generalized linear models for multiple repeated measurements. Results On average, the AUC was higher with AI support than with unaided reading (0.89 vs 0.87, respectively; P = .002). Sensitivity increased with AI support (86% [86 of 100] vs 83% [83 of 100]; P = .046), whereas specificity trended toward improvement (79% [111 of 140]) vs 77% [108 of 140]; P = .06). Reading time per case was similar (unaided, 146 seconds; supported by AI, 149 seconds; P = .15). The AUC with the AI system alone was similar to the average AUC of the radiologists (0.89 vs 0.87). Conclusion Radiologists improved their cancer detection at mammography when using an artificial intelligence system for support, without requiring additional reading time.

        "To identify the most appropriate magnetic resonance (MR) sequence for breast biopsy with regard to lesion visibility and artifact size and to assess feasibility and safety of this approach in a clinical setting.MR-guided interventions were performed in an open 1.0-T MR imager between November 2009 and January 2011. The prospective clinical study was approved by the institutional review board. Written informed consent was obtained. Four different fast dynamic sequences (balanced steady-state free precession, T1-weighted turbo gradient-echo, T1-weighted turbo spin-echo [SE], and T2-weighted single-shot SE sequences) were evaluated for artifact size of biopsy needle and in vivo for lesion visibility. In vivo breast biopsies were performed with the freehand technique and without immobilization or a positioning device by using an interactive MR mode that allowed continuous imaging in two orthogonal planes for guidance.On the basis of good lesion detection in combination with small artifact size, T1-weighted SE imaging was used for biopsy. A total of 75 biopsies were performed successfully in 69 patients (mean age, 53 years; age range, 35-78 years) (mean lesion size, 7.1 mm; range, 4-15 mm). The interactive MR platform enabled immediate localization and correction of intended needle trajectory. Average time for freehand biopsy was 12 minutes (range, 8-23 minutes). No major complications were recorded.MR-guided freehand biopsy of breast lesions with the near-real-time interactive MR platform in an open 1.0-T MR imager is safe and feasible in a clinical setting. The method simplifies work flow and intervention performance.",
        "Purpose To determine the postoperative incidence of adenomatous neoplasia in the colon proximal to an occlusive colorectal cancer where preoperative computed tomographic (CT) colonography findings were normal. Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval, with a waiver of informed consent, was obtained. This observational study included patients with occlusive colorectal cancer who underwent preoperative CT colonography between April 2007 and March 2010 that revealed normal findings (ie, no lesions \u2265 6 mm) in the proximal colon and who underwent postoperative colonoscopy. The primary outcome was postoperative colonoscopic discovery of clinically relevant lesions (ie, nondiminutive [\u22656 mm] adenomas, advanced adenomas, or cancers) in the proximal colon. The cumulative incidence of clinically relevant lesions in preoperatively normal proximal colon over the postsurgical follow-up time was analyzed by using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results The final cohort included 204 patients (102 men and 102 women; mean age, 57.3 years \u00b1 11.3 [standard deviation]). At a total of 435 postoperative colonoscopies performed over a median follow-up of 29 months (range, 1\u201374 months), clinically relevant lesions were detected in the proximal colon in 30 patients: Nonadvanced adenomas were detected in 23 patients, and advanced adenomas were detected in seven patients. The cumulative incidence of clinically relevant adenomatous lesions in the preoperatively normal proximal colon 12 and 18 months after preoperative CT colonography was 8.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.9%, 12.2%) and 9.6% (95% CI: 5%, 14%), respectively. Clinically relevant adenomatous lesions found in the proximal colon within 18 months of preoperative CT colonography were nonadvanced adenomas in 10 of 15 patients. Conclusion When the portion of the colon proximal to an occlusive cancer is devoid of nondiminutive lesions at preoperative CT colonography, colonoscopy of the proximal colon following cancer resection rarely finds clinically relevant lesions and is unlikely to reveal any lesions requiring immediate removal until routine 1-year postsurgical follow-up. \u00a9 RSNA, 2014 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To propose a new magnetic resonance (MR) classification system based on axial images for cervical compressive myelopathy (CCM) (Ax-CCM system), to assess the interobserver agreement with the Ax-CCM system, and to evaluate the relationship between Ax-CCM patterns and the baseline severity of CCM and the subsequent surgical outcome. Materials and Methods The institutional review board approved this retrospective study. A total of 202 patients (male-to-female ratio, 128:84; mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 56.3 years \u00b1 11.9; age range, 24\u201383 years) with CCM who underwent preoperative MR imaging and decompression surgery were retrospectively evaluated. The Ax-CCM pattern was based on the margin and extent of intramedullary hyperintensity on axial T2-weighted images, as follows; type 0 = normal, type 1 = diffuse, type 2 = fuzzy focal, and type 3 = discrete focal. Interobserver variability was analyzed by using the intraclass correlation coefficient across three readers. The modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score and the postoperative improvement (good vs little improvement) were evaluated according to the Ax-CCM pattern by using one-way analysis of variance, the \u03c72 test, and the Fisher exact test. Results The intraclass correlation coefficient for the Ax-CCM system was 0.83. The preoperative JOA score was significantly different according to Ax-CCM pattern across all readers (P < .05), with the type 2 pattern showing the worst preoperative JOA score (mean, 11.6 \u00b1 3.1 for readers A and C and 11.7 \u00b1 2.9 for reader B). The proportion of good improvement was significantly lower with the type 2 pattern (27 of 72 patients, 37%) than with the other patterns (64 of 123 patients, 52%) (P = .034). Conclusion The Ax-CCM system showed good interobserver agreement, and the type 2 pattern was correlated with poor preoperative neurologic status and less postoperative improvement. \u00a9 RSNA, 2015",
        "To evaluate the performance of N-[2-(diethylamino)ethyl]-(18)F-5-fluoropicolinamide ((18)F-P3BZA) for visualizing porcine retinal pigment epithelium (pRPE) cells transplanted in the striatum for the treatment of Parkinson disease and to monitor the long-term activity of implanted pRPE cells by means of (18)F-P3BZA positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in vivo.Animal work was conducted in accordance with the administrative panel on laboratory animal care. In vitro cell uptake of (18)F-P3BZA was determined with incubation of melanotic pRPE or amelanotic ARPE-19 cells with (18)F-P3BZA. To visualize the implanted pRPE cells in vivo, normal rats (four per group) were injected with pRPE or ARPE-19 cells attached to gelatin microcarriers in the left striatum and with control gelatin microcarriers in the right striatum and followed up with small animal PET/CT. Longitudinal PET/CT scans were acquired in 12 rats up to 16 days after surgery.

        "History In November 2012, a previously healthy 31-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with a 2-month history of right-sided numbness, diplopia, and intermittent nausea and dizziness. She did not have a history of fever, weight loss, headache, photophobia, seizure, or extremity weakness. Physical examination revealed left abduction limitation and right-sided hypoesthesia. Kernig and Brudzinski signs were absent, and pathergy test results were negative. Laboratory evaluation revealed normal complete and differential blood counts, normal serum chemistry, and normal immune function. Analysis of her serum was negative for antiaquaporin 4 antibody, rheumatism antibody profile, and paraneoplastic profile. Serum analysis was also negative for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and 2 RNA, hepatitis B and C antigen or antibody profile, and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed clear fluid, a normal glucose level, an elevated protein level (45 mg/dL; normal range, 20-40 mg/dL), and an elevated white blood cell count (10/mm3 [0.01 \u00d7109/L]; normal range, 0-8/mm3 [{0-0.008} \u00d7109/L]; 81% lymphocytes, 19% monocytes). No CSF-specific oligoclonal bands were detected. Gram staining, acid-fast staining, and lactic acid and cryptococcal antigen test results were negative. CSF did not grow any bacteria, fungus, or acid-fast bacillus at culture. Spinal cord MRI, brain MR angiography, and CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed normal findings (images not shown). Brain MRI and gadolinium-enhanced (20 mL gadopentetate dimeglumine, BeiLu Pharmaceutical, Beijing, China) MRI were performed ( Fig 1 ). The patient's clinical symptoms and imaging findings responded to treatment with a high dose of steroids. However, the patient's symptoms exhibited clinical and radiologic progression as she attempted to taper the steroid dose. She arbitrarily stopped taking the steroids and started traditional Chinese treatment instead. However, her condition was not controlled. [Figure: see text][Figure: see text][Figure: see text] In November 2013, she was readmitted with worsening dizziness and diplopia accompanied by hearing loss, tinnitus, slurred speech, drinking-induced cough, walking instability, and involuntary outbursts of laughter and crying. Dysmetria, ataxia, brisk tendon reflexes, pathologic reflexes, and pseudobulbar signs were observed bilaterally. Repeated biochemical and immune tests did not yield positive findings. CSF analysis revealed mild lymphocytic pleocytosis (white blood cell count, 8/mm3 [0.008 \u00d7109/L]; 83% lymphocytes, 17% monocytes) and a slightly elevated total protein level (46 mg/dL). Brain PET revealed diffuse high metabolism in the midbrain and pons (images not shown). Whole-body PET was negative for malignancy (images not shown). Brain MRI and gadolinium-enhanced MRI were performed ( Fig 2 ). The patient's clinical symptoms and imaging findings improved after treatment with a high dose of steroids. Thereafter, intravenous cyclophosphamide therapy was added after her condition deteriorated again when the prednisone dose was tapered to 20 mg per day in March 2014 ( Fig 3a ). Her pontocerebral symptoms were relatively stable in the following year, with apparent diminishment of lesions in the brainstem and cerebellum observed at brain PET (images not shown).

        "Purpose To investigate the effect of change in portal vein flow rates on the size and shape of ablations created by a bipolar radiofrequency (RF) ablation device. Materials and Methods This study was exempt from institutional animal care and use committee review. An in vitro bovine liver model perfused with autologous blood via the portal vein at three flow rates (60, 80, 100 mL/min per 100 g of liver) was used. Four ablations, two bipolar and two monopolar (control probe), were made in each of five livers perfused at each flow rate. Short- and long-axis diameters were measured from gross specimens, and volume and sphericity index were calculated for each ablation. A general linear mixed model accounting for correlation within the liver was used to evaluate the effects of flow on ablations. Analyses were performed by using software. Results There was no significant difference in the size or shape of ablations created by the bipolar device at the different flow rates (P > .05 for all outcomes). The monopolar device demonstrated the expected inverse association between ablation size and change in flow (P < .01 for all outcomes). The mean \u00b1 standard deviation of short-axis diameter, long-axis diameter, volume, and sphericity index of the bipolar ablations was 4.3 cm \u00b1 0.1, 4.2 cm \u00b1 0.1, 41.0 cm3 \u00b1 1.8, and 1.1 \u00b1 0.1, respectively.

        "Purpose To assess the diagnostic performance of gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the evaluation of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Materials and Methods This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board. The requirement to obtain informed consent was waived. A total of 366 patients with HCC who underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging between January 2007 and May 2013, including 134 with malignant PVT, 49 with benign PVT, and 183 without PVT matched for age and sex, comprised our study population. PVTs were complete in 125 patients and partial in 58 and were located in a major portal vein (n = 159) or segmental portal vein (n = 24). Two radiologists independently reviewed the MR images and assessed the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in the detection and characterization of PVT according to location (major vs segmental) and type (complete vs partial). The Fisher exact or \u03c7(2) test was used to evaluate sensitivity difference between the subsets. Results Gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging showed good sensitivity (reviewer 1, 84% [154 of 183 patients]; reviewer 2, 70% [129 of 183 patients]) and high specificity (reviewer 1, 89% [163 of 183 patients]; reviewer 2, 96% [176 of 183 patients]) in the detection of PVT. Diagnostic accuracy for differentiating malignant PVT from benign PVT was high (reviewer 1, 92% [141 of 154 patients]; reviewer 2, 95% [122 of 129 patients]). However, there was slightly lower sensitivity for detecting segmental PVT compared with that of major PVT in the malignant PVT group (reviewer 1, 95% [104 of 110 patients] vs 88% [21 of 24 patients]; reviewer 2, 82% [90 of 110 patients] vs 79% [19 of 24 patients]; P = .203 and .775 for reviewers 1 and 2, respectively). Conclusion Gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging provided good diagnostic performance in the detection of PVT and the differentiation of malignant from benign PVT in patients with HCC. However, caution is needed when evaluating potential candidates for curative treatment because of the low sensitivity for segmental PVT in the malignant PVT group.

        "Purpose To evaluate the influence of bridging local-regional therapy (LRT) on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence and overall survival after orthotopic liver transplantation and to identify factors that predict HCC recurrence after orthotopic liver transplantation. Materials and Methods The United Network for Organ Sharing database was used to identify patients with HCC who underwent liver transplantation between 2002 and 2013. Patients with complete explant data within the Milan criteria for whom a Model for End-Stage Liver Disease exception was approved were retrospectively analyzed. Kaplan-Meier estimation was used for survival analysis with log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard models to assess independent prognostic factors for overall survival. Propensity-matched analysis for treatment groups was performed to minimize selection bias. Results The rate of tumor recurrence after liver transplantation was 11.5% (321 of 2794), which significantly decreased overall survival (P < .001). The bridging LRT group exhibited lower recurrence (59 of 686 [8.6%]; P = .02) and longer median overall survival (75.9 months; P < .001). Recurrence was higher in patients older than 60 years, serum \u03b11-fetoprotein greater than 400 mg/L, bilobar distribution, multiple lesions, absent necrosis, microvascular invasion, and tumors beyond the Milan criteria (P < .05). Age, LRT status, serum \u03b11-fetoprotein, and microvascular invasion were independent risk factors (P < .05). In the matched cohort, similar factors that predicted recurrence were observed (P < .05), whereas bridging LRT (P = .03) and serum \u03b11-fetoprotein (P = .02) were independent risk factors for recurrence. Conclusion LRT significantly decreased tumor recurrence and lengthened overall survival. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016.",
        "Purpose To determine the effect of more than 20 serial injections of macrocyclic gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) on the signal intensity (SI) of the dentate nucleus (DN) on unenhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images. Materials and Methods In this retrospective, institutional review board-approved study, 33 patients who underwent at least 20 consecutive MR imaging examinations (plus an additional MR imaging for reference) with the exclusive use of macrocyclic GBCAs gadoterate meglumine and gadobutrol were analyzed. SI ratio differences were calculated for DN-to-pons and DN-to-middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP) ratios by subtracting the SI ratio at the first MR imaging examination from the SI ratio at the last MR imaging examination. One-sample t tests were used to examine if the SI ratio differences differed from 0, and Bayes factors were calculated to quantify the strength of evidence for each test. Results Patients underwent a mean of 23.03 \u00b1 (standard deviation) 4.20 GBCA administrations (mean accumulated dose, 491.21 mL \u00b1 87.04 of a 0.5 M GBCA solution) with an average of 12.09 weeks \u00b1 2.16 between every administration. Both ratio differences did not differ significantly from 0 (DN-to-pons ratio: -0.0032 \u00b1 0.0154, P = .248; DN-to-MCP ratio: -0.0011 \u00b1 0.0093, P = .521), and one-sided Bayes factors provided substantial to strong evidence against an SI ratio increase (Bayes factor for DN-to-pons ratio = 0.09 and that for DN-to-MCP ratio = 0.12). Conclusion The study indicates that 20 or more serial injections of macrocyclic GBCAs administered with on average 3 months between each injection are not associated with an SI increase in the DN. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016.",
        "Purpose To develop and validate a deep learning system (DLS) for staging liver fibrosis by using CT images in the liver. Materials and Methods DLS for CT-based staging of liver fibrosis was created by using a development data set that included portal venous phase CT images in 7461 patients with pathologically confirmed liver fibrosis. The diagnostic performance of the DLS was evaluated in separate test data sets for 891 patients. The influence of patient characteristics and CT techniques on the staging accuracy of the DLS was evaluated by logistic regression analysis. In a subset of 421 patients, the diagnostic performance of the DLS was compared with that of the radiologist's assessment, aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI), and fibrosis-4 index by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and Obuchowski index. Results In the test data sets, the DLS had a staging accuracy of 79.4% (707 of 891) and an AUROC of 0.96, 0.97, and 0.95 for diagnosing significant fibrosis (F2\u20134), advanced fibrosis (F3\u20134), and cirrhosis (F4), respectively. At multivariable analysis, only pathologic fibrosis stage significantly affected the staging accuracy of the DLS (P = .016 and .013 for F1 and F2, respectively, compared with F4), whereas etiology of liver disease and CT technique did not. The DLS (Obuchowski index, 0.94) outperformed the radiologist's interpretation, APRI, and fibrosis-4 index (Obuchowski index range, 0.71\u20130.81; P \u02c2 .001) for staging liver fibrosis. Conclusion The deep learning system allows for accurate staging of liver fibrosis by using CT images. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Owing to recent advances in computing power, iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms have become a clinically viable option in computed tomographic (CT) imaging. Substantial evidence is accumulating about the advantages of IR algorithms over established analytical methods, such as filtered back projection. IR improves image quality through cyclic image processing. Although all available solutions share the common mechanism of artifact reduction and/or potential for radiation dose savings, chiefly due to image noise suppression, the magnitude of these effects depends on the specific IR algorithm. In the first section of this contribution, the technical bases of IR are briefly reviewed and the currently available algorithms released by the major CT manufacturers are described. In the second part, the current status of their clinical implementation is surveyed. Regardless of the applied IR algorithm, the available evidence attests to the substantial potential of IR algorithms for overcoming traditional limitations in CT imaging.",
        "Purpose To evaluate quantitative perfusion measurements of dynamic indocyanine green (ICG)\u2013enhanced optical imaging for monitoring synovitis in the hands of patients with inflammatory arthritis compared with dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and clinical outcome. Materials and Methods This study was approved by the ethics committee at the institution. Individual joints (n = 840) in the hands and wrists of 28 patients (14 women; mean age, 53.3 years) with inflammatory arthritis were examined at three different time points: before start of therapy and 12 and 24 weeks after start of therapy or therapy escalation. Treatment response was assessed by using clinical measures (simple disease activity index [SDAI]), ICG-enhanced optical imaging, and DCE MR imaging. Dynamic images were obtained for optical imaging and DCE MR imaging. The rate of early enhancement (REE) of the perfusion curves of each joint was calculated by using in-house developed software. Correlation coefficients were estimated to evaluate the associations of changes of imaging parameters and SDAI change. Results Quantitative perfusion measurements with optical imaging and MR imaging correctly identified patients who responded (n = 18) and did not respond to therapy (n = 10), as determined by SDAI. The difference of REE after 24 weeks of treatment compared with baseline in responders was significantly reduced in optical imaging and MR imaging (optical imaging: mean, \u221221.5%; MR imaging: mean, \u221241.0%; P < .001 for both), while in nonresponders it was increased (optical imaging: mean, 10.8%; P = .075; MR imaging: mean, 8.7%; P = .03). The REE of optical imaging significantly correlated with MR imaging (\u03c1 = 0.80; P < .001) and SDAI (\u03c1 = 0.61; P < .001). Conclusion Quantitative analysis of contrast-enhanced optical imaging allows for potential therapeutic monitoring of synovitis in patients with inflammatory arthritis. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Background Spatial resolution, soft-tissue contrast, and dose-efficient capabilities of photon-counting CT (PCCT) potentially allow a better quality and diagnostic confidence of coronary CT angiography (CCTA) in comparison to conventional CT. Purpose To compare the quality of CCTA scans obtained with a clinical prototype PCCT system and an energy-integrating detector (EID) dual-layer CT (DLCT) system. Materials and Methods In this prospective board-approved study with informed consent, participants with coronary artery disease underwent retrospective electrocardiographically gated CCTA with both systems after injection of 65-75 mL of 400 mg/mL iodinated contrast agent at 5 mL/sec. A prior phantom task-based quality assessment of the detectability index of coronary lesions was performed. Ultra-high-resolution parameters were used for PCCT (1024 matrix, 0.25-mm section thickness) and EID DLCT (512 matrix, 0.67-mm section thickness). Three cardiac radiologists independently performed a blinded analysis using a five-point quality score (1 = insufficient, 5 = excellent) for overall image quality, diagnostic confidence, and diagnostic quality of calcifications, stents, and noncalcified plaques. A logistic regression model, adjusted for radiologists, was used to evaluate the proportion of improvement in scores with the best method. Results Fourteen consecutive participants (12 men; mean age, 61 years \u00b1 17) were enrolled. Scores of overall quality and diagnostic confidence were higher with PCCT images with a median of 5 (interquartile range [IQR], 2) and 5 (IQR, 1) versus 4 (IQR, 1) and 4 (IQR, 3) with EID DLCT images, using a mean tube current of 255 mAs \u00b1 0 versus 349 mAs \u00b1 111 for EID DLCT images (P < .01). Proportions of improvement with PCCT images for quality of calcification, stent, and noncalcified plaque were 100%, 92% (95% CI: 71, 98), and 45% (95% CI: 28, 63), respectively. In the phantom study, detectability indexes were 2.3-fold higher for lumen and 2.9-fold higher for noncalcified plaques with PCCT images. Conclusion Coronary CT angiography with a photon-counting CT system demonstrated in humans an improved image quality and diagnostic confidence compared with an energy-integrating dual-layer CT. \u00a9 RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "History A 56-year-old woman presented to the emergency department after a cross-country flight. While in flight, she experienced sudden onset of epigastric and midsternal chest pain with shortness of breath. Her symptoms improved markedly after she received oxygen on board, and she finished the flight without further incident. Once home later that night, the pain recurred, and she was taken to the hospital. Her history included chronic pain syndrome, hypertension, and refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, for which she had undergone radiofrequency ablation on two occasions. Her most recent ablation was 1 month prior. Upon arrival in the emergency department, her vital signs were within normal limits, and an electrocardiogram was unchanged from baseline. A chest radiograph obtained at the time of physical examination was unchanged from baseline. Given her recent travel history, there was suspicion for a pulmonary embolism. Ventilation-perfusion imaging and lower extremity Doppler ultrasonography were performed (images not shown) and revealed no evidence of pulmonary embolism or lower extremity thrombus. Because of the patient's clinical stability and because her symptoms had improved, she declined admission for observation and returned home against medical advice. The patient returned to the emergency department 2 days later in severe distress, with unstable vital signs, a jaundiced appearance, and substantial pain in her chest and abdomen. Her creatinine level was 4.4 mg/dL (388.9 \u03bcmol/L) (increased from 0.9 mg/dL [79.6 \u03bcmol/L] 2 days prior). Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were obtained and indicated increasing pericardial effusion. Bedside echocardiography enabled confirmation of these radiographic findings, and pericardiocentesis was performed. The patient's condition immediately improved, and she was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit. Her symptoms recurred 3 days later, and a pericardial drain was placed. Fluid cultures were preliminarily positive for enterococcus and gram-negative rods. After drain placement, she was scheduled for definitive treatment of recurrent symptomatic effusion. The preoperative work-up included a water-soluble contrast material-enhanced (iodixanol, 320 mg of iodine per milliliter) esophagram with computed tomography (CT) of the chest performed immediately thereafter.",
        "Purpose To determine the energy levels that provide optimal imaging of thoracic circulation at dual-energy computed tomographic (CT) angiography with reduced iodine load in comparison with a standard technique. Materials and Methods The institutional review board approved the study with waiver of patient consent. Eighty patients underwent a dual-source, dual-energy CT examination after administration of low-concentration contrast material (170 mg of iodine per milliliter), and eight series of images were reconstructed, including the original polychromatic images at 80 and 140 kV and six series of virtual monochromatic spectral images at 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 keV. For each vascular compartment, the energy level that provided optimal evaluation on virtual monochromatic spectral images was determined, and these series were compared with the polychromatic dual-energy images and with standard chest CT images that were used as controls. Comparisons between groups were performed by using the paired Student t test for continuous variables and the McNemar test for categorical variables. Comparisons between dual-energy and standard CT images were performed by using the unpaired Student t test for continuous variables and the \u03c72 test for categorical variables. Results For the aorta, pulmonary arteries, and veins, the reconstruction at 60 keV provided adequate attenuation without marked beam-hardening artifacts in 90% of patients, with the highest contrast-to-noise and signal-to-noise ratios, the lowest level of subjective noise, and no significant differences with images at 80 kV (mean energy, 54 keV). For the superior vena cava and brachiocephalic veins, the reconstructions at 100 keV enabled artifact-free analysis of the perivascular anatomic zone without a significant difference with images at 140 kV (mean energy, 92 keV). Compared with standard CT images acquired after administration of a 35% iodinated contrast agent, there was a statistically significant reduction in the frequency of artifacts around systemic veins at 100 keV (P < .001) and similar overall image quality for central vessels at 60 keV (P > .05). Conclusion An optimal analysis of thoracic circulation can be achieved on virtual monochromatic spectral images at 60 keV and 100 keV and on the original polychromatic images at 80 kV and 140 kV. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.12120195/-/DC1",
        "Purpose To prospectively compare an investigational version of a complex-based chemical shift\u2013based fat fraction magnetic resonance (MR) imaging method with MR spectroscopy for the quantification of hepatic steatosis. Materials and Methods This study was approved by the institutional review board and was HIPAA compliant. Written informed consent was obtained before all studies. Fifty-five patients (31 women, 24 men; age range, 24\u201371 years) were prospectively imaged at 1.5 T with quantitative MR imaging and single-voxel MR spectroscopy, each within a single breath hold. The effects of T2* correction, spectral modeling of fat, and magnitude fitting for eddy current correction on fat quantification with MR imaging were investigated by reconstructing fat fraction images from the same source data with different combinations of error correction. Single-voxel T2-corrected MR spectroscopy was used to measure fat fraction and served as the reference standard. All MR spectroscopy data were postprocessed at a separate institution by an MR physicist who was blinded to MR imaging results. Fat fractions measured with MR imaging and MR spectroscopy were compared statistically to determine the correlation (r2), and the slope and intercept as measures of agreement between MR imaging and MR spectroscopy fat fraction measurements, to determine whether MR imaging can help quantify fat, and examine the importance of T2* correction, spectral modeling of fat, and eddy current correction. Two-sided t tests (significance level, P = .05) were used to determine whether estimated slopes and intercepts were significantly different from 1.0 and 0.0, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity for the classification of clinically significant steatosis were evaluated. Results Overall, there was excellent correlation between MR imaging and MR spectroscopy for all reconstruction combinations. However, agreement was only achieved when T2* correction, spectral modeling of fat, and magnitude fitting for eddy current correction were used (r2 = 0.99; slope \u00b1 standard deviation = 1.00 \u00b1 0.01, P = .77; intercept \u00b1 standard deviation = 0.2% \u00b1 0.1, P = .19). Conclusion T1-independent chemical shift\u2013based water-fat separation MR imaging methods can accurately quantify fat over the entire liver, by using MR spectroscopy as the reference standard, when T2* correction, spectral modeling of fat, and eddy current correction methods are used. \u00a9 RSNA, 2011",
        "Purpose To retrospectively identify the relationship between epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status, predominant histologic subtype, and computed tomographic (CT) characteristics in surgically resected lung adenocarcinomas in a cohort of Asian patients. materials and Methods This study was approved by the institutional review board, with waiver of informed consent. Preoperative chest CT findings were retrospectively evaluated in 385 surgically resected lung adenocarcinomas. A total of 30 CT descriptors were assessed. EGFR mutations at exons 18\u201321 were determined by using the amplification refractory mutation system. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent factors of harboring EGFR mutation status. The final model was selected by using the backward elimination method, and two areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) were compared with the nonparametric approach of DeLong, DeLong, and Clarke-Pearson. Results EGFR mutations were found in 168 (43.6%) of 385 patients. Mutations were found more frequently in (a) female patients (P < .001); (b)those who had never smoked (P < .001); (c)those with lepidic predominant adenocarcinomas (P = .001) or intermediate pathologic grade (P < .001); (e) smaller tumors (P < .001); (f)tumors with spiculation (P = .019), ground-glass opacity (GGO) or mixed GGO (P < .001), air bronchogram (P = .006), bubblelike lucency (P < .001), vascular convergence (P = .024), thickened adjacent bronchovascular bundles (P = .027), or pleural retraction (P < .001); and (g) tumors without pleural attachment (P = .004), a well-defined margin (P = .010), marked heterogeneous enhancement (P = .001), severe peripheral emphysema (P = .002), severe peripheral fibrosis (P = .013), or lymphadenopathy (P = .028). The most important and significantly independent prognostic factors of harboring EGFR-activating mutation for the model with both clinical variables and CT features were those who had never smoked and those with smaller tumors, bubblelike lucency, homogeneous enhancement, or pleural retraction when adjusting for histologic subtype, pathologic grade, or thickened adjacent bronchovascular bundles. ROC curve analysis showed that use of clinical variables combined with CT features (area under the ROC curve = 0.778) was superior to use of clinical variables alone (area under the ROC curve = 0.690). Conclusion CT imaging features of lung adenocarcinomas in combination with clinical variables can be used to prognosticate EGFR mutation status better than use of clinical variables alone. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Background The relationship between method of breast cancer screening (mammography or US) and survival outcome in patients with screening-detected ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) has not been determined. Purpose To investigate whether different methods of breast cancer screening are associated with different survival outcomes in patients with screening-detected DCIS and to evaluate clinical-pathologic and imaging factors associated with second breast cancer. Materials and Methods We retrospectively identified women who underwent surgery to treat DCIS initially detected with screening mammography or US between July 2004 and December 2011 in a single institution. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were assessed. Factors associated with second breast cancer (invasive carcinoma or DCIS) were found with multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Subgroups were analyzed according to screening method. Results A total of 814 women (median age, 47 years; age range, 25-81 years) were included; 627 underwent treatment for screening mammography-detected DCIS (mammography-detected group), and 187 underwent treatment for screening US-detected DCIS (US-detected group). During follow-up (median, 7 years; interquartile range, 5-8 years), 26 ipsilateral and 26 contralateral second breast cancers (6.4%, 52 of 814) were found, with 44 in the mammography-detected group and eight in the US-detected group. The overall 5-year OS and DFS rates were 100% and 95.3%, respectively. DFS rates did not differ according to screening method (P = .21, 5-year DFS rates were 94.9% in the mammography-detected group and 96.5% in the US-detected group). In the mammography-detected group, higher nuclear grade (intermediate grade: hazard ratio [HR], 5.7; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3, 24.3; P = 0.02) (high grade: HR, 8.0; 95% CI: 1.9, 34.2; P = .01) and dense breast (HR, 3.5; 95% CI: 1.1, 11.4; P = 0.04) were associated with second breast cancer. In the US-detected group, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positivity was associated with second breast cancer (HR, 9.2; 95% CI: 2.2, 38.5; P = .002). Conclusion Disease-free survival of patients who underwent treatment for screening-detected ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) did not differ according to screening detection method. In patients with screening mammography-detected DCIS, higher nuclear grade and dense breast were associated with second breast cancer, and in patients with screening US-detected DCIS, human epidermal growth factor 2 positivity was associated with second breast cancer. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "To examine the associations between intracranial artery calcifications (IACs) and coronary artery calcifications (CACs) in patients with ischemic stroke and to assess the predictive value of IAC for asymptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD).This retrospective study, approved by an institutional review board that waived the need for informed consent, included 314 consecutive patients who had acute ischemic stroke and who underwent both brain and coronary computed tomography (CT) within 1 month of stroke. IAC was quantified semiautomatically by calculating both Agatston scores (area of calcification multiplied by a weighted value assigned to its highest Hounsfield unit) and volumes on thin-section unenhanced images and was correlated with coronary calcium scores and volumes. Quartiles were created for IAC scores and were used for logistic regression analysis. An optimal IAC score cutoff value was determined and used to predict the presence of asymptomatic CAD. Independent factors for asymptomatic CAD were assessed by using multiple logistic regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to evaluate the added value of IAC scores for prediction of asymptomatic CAD.IAC and CAC were significantly correlated for both Agatston scores and volumes (R = 0.665 and 0.663, respectively; P < .001). A graded association was found between IAC scores and presence of asymptomatic CAD. Both IAC scores of 120.11 or greater (odds ratio [OR], 2.57; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.45, 4.55) and diabetes mellitus (OR, 4.23; 95% CI: 2.42, 7.4) were independent predictors for asymptomatic CAD. Adding the IAC score to analytic models significantly improved the ability to predict asymptomatic CAD.The IAC scores quantified by using unenhanced CT correlate significantly with coronary calcium scores and may serve as an independent predictor of asymptomatic CAD in patients with ischemic stroke.",
        "Background The long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on pulmonary structure and function remain incompletely characterized. Purpose To test whether SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to small airways disease in patients with persistent symptoms. Materials and Methods In this single-center study at a university teaching hospital, adults with confirmed COVID-19 who remained symptomatic more than 30 days following diagnosis were prospectively enrolled from June to December 2020 and compared with healthy participants (controls) prospectively enrolled from March to August 2018. Participants with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) were classified as ambulatory, hospitalized, or having required the intensive care unit (ICU) based on the highest level of care received during acute infection. Symptoms, pulmonary function tests, and chest CT images were collected. Quantitative CT analysis was performed using supervised machine learning to measure regional ground-glass opacity (GGO) and using inspiratory and expiratory image-matching to measure regional air trapping. Univariable analyses and multivariable linear regression were used to compare groups. Results Overall, 100 participants with PASC (median age, 48 years; 66 women) were evaluated and compared with 106 matched healthy controls; 67% (67 of 100) of the participants with PASC were classified as ambulatory, 17% (17 of 100) were hospitalized, and 16% (16 of 100) required the ICU. In the hospitalized and ICU groups, the mean percentage of total lung classified as GGO was 13.2% and 28.7%, respectively, and was higher than that in the ambulatory group (3.7%, P < .001 for both comparisons). The mean percentage of total lung affected by air trapping was 25.4%, 34.6%, and 27.3% in the ambulatory, hospitalized, and ICU groups, respectively, and 7.2% in healthy controls (P < .001). Air trapping correlated with the residual volume\u2013to\u2013total lung capacity ratio (\u03c1 = 0.6, P < .001). Conclusion In survivors of COVID-19, small airways disease occurred independently of initial infection severity.

        "Background Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a global social and public health problem, but published literature regarding the exacerbation of physical IPV during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is lacking. Purpose To assess the incidence, patterns, and severity of injuries in IPV victims during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 compared with the prior 3 years. Materials and Methods The demographics, clinical presentation, injuries, and radiologic findings of patients reporting physical abuse arising from IPV during the statewide COVID-19 pandemic between March 11 and May 3, 2020, were compared with data from the same period for the past 3 years. Pearson \u03c72 and Fisher exact tests were used for analysis. Results A total of 26 victims of physical IPV from 2020 (mean age, 37 years \u00b1 13 [standard deviation]; 25 women) were evaluated and compared with 42 victims of physical IPV (mean age, 41 years \u00b1 15; 40 women) from 2017 to 2019. Although the overall number of patients who reported IPV decreased during the pandemic, the incidence of physical IPV was 1.8 times greater (95% CI: 1.1, 3.0; P = .01). The total number of deep injuries was 28 during 2020 versus 16 from 2017 to 2019; the number of deep injuries per victim was 1.1 during 2020 compared with 0.4 from 2017 to 2019 (P < .001). The incidence of high-risk abuse defined by mechanism was two times greater in 2020 (95% CI: 1.2, 4.7; P = .01). Patients who experienced IPV during the COVID-19 pandemic were more likely to be White; 17 (65%) victims in 2020 were White compared with 11 (26%) in the prior years (P = .007). Conclusion There was a higher incidence and severity of physical intimate partner violence (IPV) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic compared with the prior 3 years. These results suggest that victims of IPV delayed reaching out to health care services until the late stages of the abuse cycle during the COVID-19 pandemic. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020",
        "Purpose To determine the accuracy of computed tomography (CT) in identifying the histopathologic usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern in rheumatoid arthritis\u2013associated interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD). Materials and Methods All patients were enrolled into institutional review board-approved longitudinal cohorts at their respective institution, and informed consent was obtained at the time of enrollment. Images of patients with surgical lung biopsy-proved RA-ILD (n = 69) were collected from three tertiary care centers. Two experienced thoracic radiologists independently reviewed the CT scans. The CT pattern was categorized as definite UIP, possible UIP, or inconsistent with UIP in accordance with published criteria. Findings of biopsies were reviewed by an experienced lung pathologist. The sensitivity and specificity of definite CT UIP pattern to histopathologic UIP pattern were determined. The agreement between radiologists was assessed by calculating a \u03ba score. Results The histopathologic UIP pattern was present in 42 of 69 (61%) patients. Men were more likely than women to have a histopathologic UIP pattern (P = .02). Twenty patients (29%, 20 of 69) had a definite UIP pattern on CT scans. The specificity of CT UIP pattern was 96% (26 of 27; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 81%, 100%), with a negative predictive value of 53% (26 of 49). The sensitivity of CT UIP pattern was 45% (19 of 42; 95% CI: 30%, 61%), with a positive predictive value of 95% (19 of 20). The agreement between radiologists for definite UIP pattern versus not was 87% (\u03ba = 0.67, P < .0001). Conclusion Definite UIP pattern on a CT scan in RA-ILD is highly specific and moderately sensitive for histopathologic UIP pattern. CT can therefore help accurately identify the UIP pattern in RA-ILD. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Background Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is replacing digital mammography (DM) in the clinical workflow. Currently, there are limited prospective studies comparing the diagnostic accuracy of both examinations and the role of synthetic mammography (SM) and computer-aided detection (CAD). Purpose To compare the accuracy of DM versus DM + DBT in population-based breast cancer screening. Materials and Methods This prospective study, performed from November 2010 to December 2012, included 24 301 women (mean age, 59.1 years \u00b1 5.7 [standard deviation]) with 281 cancers, of which 51 were interval cancers. Each examination was independently interpreted with four reading modes: DM, DM + CAD, DM + DBT, and SM + DBT. Sensitivity and specificity were compared for DM versus DM + DBT, DM versus DM + CAD, DM + DBT versus SM + DBT, and DM versus DM + DBT at double reading. Reader-adjusted performance characteristics of reading modes were evaluated on the basis of pre-arbitration (initial interpretation) scores. Statistical analysis was based on cluster bootstrap analysis using 10 000 random resamples. Results Sensitivity was 54.1% (152 of 281) for DM and 70.5% (198 of 281) for DM + DBT. Reader-adjusted difference was 12.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.2%, 19.7%; P = .001). Specificity was 94.2% (false-positive fraction [FPF], 5.8%; 1388 of 24 020) for DM and 95.0% (FPF, 5.0%; 1209/24 020) for DM + DBT, with a reader-adjusted difference in FPF of -1.2% (95% CI: -1.7%, -0.7%; P < .001). Sensitivity was 69.0% (194 of 281) for SM + DBT and 70.5% (198 of 281) for DM + DBT, with a reader-adjusted difference of 1.0% (95% CI: -6.2%, 8.5%; P = .77). Specificity was 95.4% (FPF, 4.6%; 1111 of 24 020) for SM + DBT and 95.0% (FPF, 5.0%;1209 of 24 020) for DM + DBT, with reader-adjusted 95% CIs for FPF of 4.7%, 5.4% and 5.0%, 5.7%, respectively, and a difference of -0.3% (95% CI: -0.8%, 0.2%; P = .23). Differences in sensitivity and specificity with the addition of CAD were small and not significant (P > .2). Conclusion Addition of digital breast tomosynthesis to digital mammography resulted in significant gains in sensitivity and specificity. Synthetic mammography in combination with digital breast tomosynthesis had similar sensitivity and specificity to digital mammography in combination with digital breast tomosynthesis. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 See also the editorial by L\u00e5ng in this issue.",
        "The Fleischner Society Guidelines for management of solid nodules were published in 2005, and separate guidelines for subsolid nodules were issued in 2013. Since then, new information has become available; therefore, the guidelines have been revised to reflect current thinking on nodule management. The revised guidelines incorporate several substantive changes that reflect current thinking on the management of small nodules. The minimum threshold size for routine follow-up has been increased, and recommended follow-up intervals are now given as a range rather than as a precise time period to give radiologists, clinicians, and patients greater discretion to accommodate individual risk factors and preferences. The guidelines for solid and subsolid nodules have been combined in one simplified table, and specific recommendations have been included for multiple nodules. These guidelines represent the consensus of the Fleischner Society, and as such, they incorporate the opinions of a multidisciplinary international group of thoracic radiologists, pulmonologists, surgeons, pathologists, and other specialists.

        "Purpose To (a) perform a pilot study comparing radiologists' reading of breast density at computed tomography (CT) of the chest with breast density readings from mammography performed in the same patient and (b) compare a subset of these with computer-derived measurements of breast density at CT. Materials and Methods The institutional review board waived informed consent for this HIPAA-compliant retrospective review of mammograms and chest CT scans from 206 women obtained within 1 year of each other. Two radiologists with expertise in interpreting mammographic and CT findings independently reviewed the mammograms and CT scans and classified each case into one of the four breast density types defined by the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System of the American College of Radiology. Interreader agreements for the mammographic density types and CT density grades were determined by using the Cohen weighted \u03ba statistic. The intrareader correlation coefficient was determined in a subset of CT images. In another subset of 40 cases, the agreement of the semiautomated computer-derived measurements of breast density with the consensus of the two radiologists was assessed. Results Interreader agreement was higher for the CT density grades than for the mammographic density types, with 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.73, 0.85) versus 0.62 (95% CI: 0.54, 0.70). The intrareader reliability of breast density grades on CT images was 0.88. The computer-derived breast density measurements agreed with those of the radiologists in 36 (90%) cases. When four cases were manually adjusted for the complex anatomy, there was agreement for all cases. Conclusion Preliminary results suggest that on further validation, breast density readings at CT may provide important additional risk information on CT of the chest and that computer-derived measurements may be helpful in such assessment. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "To assess whether native T1 mapping provides noninvasive estimation of diffuse myocardial fibrosis and whether it correlates with subclinical myocardial dysfunction in asymptomatic patients with aortic stenosis (AS).The local institutional review board approved the study, and all patients gave informed consent. Eighty asymptomatic patients with moderate or severe AS and normal left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (mean age, 67 years; range, 31-81 years) and 15 sex-matched control subjects (mean age, 33 years; range, 23-41 years) were prospectively enrolled. Patients underwent two-dimensional echocardiography, speckle tracking imaging, and cardiac 3.0-T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, including mapping of T1 relaxation time by using the modified Look-Locker inversion-recovery sequence. Correlations between native T1 values and the degree of diffuse fibrosis in myocardial specimens obtained during aortic valve replacement surgery were analyzed in a subset of 20 patients. Correlations between parameters of myocardial function and structure and native T1 values were assessed with Pearson correlation coefficients.Native T1 values correlated well with the degree of diffuse myocardial fibrosis in intraoperative myocardial biopsy specimens (r = 0.777, P < .001) and differed significantly between patients with AS and control subjects (1208 msec \u00b1 45 vs 1169 msec \u00b1 21, P < .001). LV volumes and mass differed significantly according to AS groups, categorized by T1 tertiles (all P < .001), as well as degree of AS severity (0.55 cm(2)/m(2) \u00b1 0.14 for lowest native T1 tertile, 0.46 cm(2)/m(2) \u00b1 0.12 for middle native T1 tertile, and 0.45 cm(2)/m(2) \u00b1 0.13 for highest native T1 tertile [P = .008] for indexed aortic valve area at echocardiography). Native T1 correlated significantly with global longitudinal strain measured with two-dimensional speckle tracking imaging (r = 0.598, P < .001), e' velocity (r = -0.437, P < .001), and indexed left atrial volume (r = 0.475, P < .001).Native T1 mapping provides a noninvasive estimation of diffuse myocardial fibrosis and correlates with subclinical myocardial dysfunction in asymptomatic patients with AS.",
        "Purpose To evaluate the performance of a deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) model compared with a traditional natural language processing (NLP) model in extracting pulmonary embolism (PE) findings from thoracic computed tomography (CT) reports from two institutions. Materials and Methods Contrast material\u2013enhanced CT examinations of the chest performed between January 1, 1998, and January 1, 2016, were selected. Annotations by two human radiologists were made for three categories: the presence, chronicity, and location of PE. Classification of performance of a CNN model with an unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining vector representations of words was compared with the open-source application PeFinder. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and F1 scores for both the CNN model and PeFinder in the internal and external validation sets were determined. Results The CNN model demonstrated an accuracy of 99% and an area under the curve value of 0.97. For internal validation report data, the CNN model had a statistically significant larger F1 score (0.938) than did PeFinder (0.867) when classifying findings as either PE positive or PE negative, but no significant difference in sensitivity, specificity, or accuracy was found. For external validation report data, no statistical difference between the performance of the CNN model and PeFinder was found. Conclusion A deep learning CNN model can classify radiology free-text reports with accuracy equivalent to or beyond that of an existing traditional NLP model. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To determine whether the relationship between pulmonary function and computed tomographic (CT) lung attenuation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is traditionally described with single univariate and multivariate statistical models, could be more accurately described with a multiple model estimation approach.The study was approved by the local ethics committee. All participants provided written informed consent. The prediction of the percentage area with CT attenuation values less than -950 HU at inspiration (%LAA-950insp) and less than -910 HU at expiration (%LAA-910exp) obtained with single univariate and multivariate models was compared with that obtained with a multiple model estimation approach in 132 patients with COPD.At univariate analysis, %LAA-950insp and %LAA-910exp values higher than the mean value of this cohort (19.1% and 22.0%) showed better correlation with percentage of predicted diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide (Dlco%) than with airflow obstruction (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1]/vital capacity [VC]). Conversely, %LAA-950insp and %LAA-910exp values lower than the mean value were correlated with FEV1/VC but not with Dlco%. Multiple model estimation performed with two multivariate regressions, each selecting the most appropriate functional variables (FEV1/VC for mild parenchymal destruction, Dlco% and functional residual capacity for severe parenchymal destruction), predicted better than single multivariate regression both %LAA-950insp (R(2) = 0.75 vs 0.46) and %LAA-910exp (R(2) = 0.83 vs 0.63).The relationship between pulmonary function data and CT densitometric changes in COPD varies with the level of lung attenuation impairment. The nonlinear profile of this relationship is accurately predicted with a multiple model estimation approach.",
        "Purpose To determine whether flow velocity can be measured by using projection data from computed tomographic (CT) scans obtained during contrast material injection in a phantom model. Materials and Methods The authors constructed a 12.7-mm-diameter single-channel flow phantom with constant water flow velocity settings of 25.3, 43.9, and 70.5 cm/sec. For each flow velocity, serial axial scans were obtained with 16-section multidetector CT while a 10-mL bolus of contrast material was injected upstream of the imaging plane. For each bolus injection, the CT projection data from the scan with the sharpest increase in magnitude of detected contrast material was used for flow velocity measurements. Flow velocity was calculated as the ratio of distance between CT detector rows and the corresponding time lag in the contrast enhancement curves and was correlated with the reference velocities. Five separate contrast material injections and CT measurements were made for each flow velocity setting. Results The correlation coefficient between the CT measurements of flow velocity and the reference measurements was 0.98 (P < .05). The mean CT measurements of flow velocity were 34.2, 53.9, and 80.8 cm/sec for slow, moderate, and fast velocity settings, respectively, overestimating the corresponding actual flow velocities by 26%, 18%, and 13% and showing precision values (coefficients of variation) of 5.2%, 3.7%, and 6.6%. Conclusion Flow velocity can be measured from row-to-row multidetector CT projectional data obtained during a single gantry revolution as a bolus of contrast material flows through a vascular phantom. With further development, this novel technique could potentially provide physiologic information to complement the anatomic CT angiographic findings of vascular disease. \u00a9 RSNA, 2011",
        "There is currently no consensus regarding preferred clinical outcome measures following image-guided tumor ablation or clear definitions of oncologic end points. This consensus document proposes standardized definitions for a broad range of oncologic outcome measures with recommendations on how to uniformly document, analyze, and report outcomes. The initiative was coordinated by the Society of Interventional Oncology in collaboration with the Definition for the Assessment of Time-to-Event End Points in Cancer Trials, or DATECAN, group. According to predefined criteria, based on experience with clinical trials, an international panel of 62 experts convened. Recommendations were developed using the validated three-step modified Delphi consensus method. Consensus was reached on when to assess outcomes per patient, per session, or per tumor; on starting and ending time and survival time definitions; and on time-to-event end points. Although no consensus was reached on the preferred classification system to report complications, quality of life, and health economics issues, the panel did agree on using the most recent version of a validated patient-reported outcome questionnaire. This article provides a framework of key opinion leader recommendations with the intent to facilitate a clear interpretation of results and standardize worldwide communication. Widespread adoption will improve reproducibility, allow for accurate comparisons, and avoid misinterpretations in the field of interventional oncology research. Published under a CC BY 4.0 license.

        "To evaluate the midterm clinical and angiographic outcomes after pipeline embolization device (PED) placement for treatment of intracranial aneurysms.This prospective nonrandomized multicenter study was approved by the review boards of all involved centers; informed consent was obtained. Patients (143 patients, 178 aneurysms) with unruptured saccular or fusiform aneurysms or recurrent aneurysms after previous treatment were included and observed angiographically for up to 18 months and clinically for up to 3 years. Study endpoints included complete aneurysm occlusion; neurologic complications within 30 days and up to 3 years; clinical outcome of cranial nerve palsy after PED placement; angiographic evidence of occlusion or stenosis of parent artery and that of occlusion of covered side branches at 6, 12, and 18 months; and clinical and computed tomographic evidence of perforator infarction.There were five (3.5%) cases of periprocedural death or major stroke (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] > 3) (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3%, 8.4%), including two posttreatment delayed ruptures, two intracerebral hemorrhages, and one thromboembolism. Five (3.5%) patients had minor neurologic complications within 30 days (mRS = 1) (95% CI: 1.3%, 8.4%), including transient ischemic attack (n = 2), small cerebral infarction (n = 2), and cranial nerve palsy (n = 1). Beyond 30 days, there was one fatal intracerebral hemorrhage and one transient ischemic attack. Ten of 13 patients (95% CI: 46%, 93.8%) completely recovered from symptoms of cranial nerve palsy within a median of 3.5 months. Angiographic results at 18 months revealed a complete aneurysm occlusion rate of 84% (49 of 58; 95% CI: 72.1%, 92.2%), with no cases of parent artery occlusion, parent artery stenosis (<50%) in three patients, and occlusion of a covered side branch in two cases (posterior communicating arteries). Perforator infarction did not occur.PED placement is a reasonably safe and effective treatment for intracranial aneurysms. The treatment is promising for aneurysms of unfavorable morphologic features, such as wide neck, large size, fusiform morphology, incorporation of side branches, and posttreatment recanalization, and should be considered a first choice for treating unruptured aneurysms and recurrent aneurysms after previous treatments.http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.12120422/-/DC1.",

        "Purpose To develop a practical thyroid imaging reporting and data system (TIRADS) with which to categorize thyroid nodules and stratify their malignant risk. Materials and Methods The institutional review board approved this retrospective study, and the requirement to obtain informed consent for the review of images and records was waived. From May to December 2008, ultrasonographically (US)-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) was performed in 3674 focal thyroid nodules in 3414 consecutive patients. The study included the 1658 thyroid nodules (\u22651 cm in maximum diameter at US) in 1638 patients (1373 women, 265 men) for which pathologic diagnosis or follow-up findings were available. Univariate and multivariate analyses with generalized estimating equations were performed to investigate the relationship between suspicious US features and thyroid cancer. A score for each significant factor was assigned and multiplied by the \u03b2 coefficient obtained for each significant factor from multivariate logistic regression analysis. Scores for each significant factor were then added, resulting in an equation that fitted the probability of malignancy in thyroid nodules. The authors evaluated the fitted probability by using a regression equation; the risk of malignancy was determined according to the number of suspicious US features. Results The following US features showed a significant association with malignancy: solid component, hypoechogenicity, marked hypoechogenicity, microlobulated or irregular margins, microcalcifications, and taller-than-wide shape. As the number of suspicious US features increased, the fitted probability and risk of malignancy also increased. Positive predictive values according to the number of suspicious US features were significantly different (P < .001). Conclusion Risk stratification of thyroid malignancy by using the number of suspicious US features allows for a practical and convenient TIRADS. \u00a9 RSNA, 2011",
        "To investigate the diagnostic value of a half dose compared with a full dose of gadobenate dimeglumine in the assessment of synovitis or tenosynovitis in the wrist and finger joints in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and a disease activity score greater than 3.2.With institutional review board approval and informed consent, 57 patients with early RA underwent 3-T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with two different doses of contrast media. The contrast enhancement was measured in inflamed synovial tissue at half dose (0.05 mmol per kilogram of body weight) and at full dose (0.1 mmol/kg) by using T1-weighted sequences with fat saturation. The differences and the correlation of signal intensities (SIs) at half- and full-dose sequences were compared by using the paired t test and Pearson correlations. Image quality, Rheumatoid Arthritis MRI Score (RAMRIS), and tenosynovitis score on half- and full-dose images were compared by two observers using the Wilcoxon test. Interrater agreement was assessed by using \u03ba statistics.A significant difference in SI was found between half-dose and full-dose gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced synovial tissue (mean: 914.35 \u00b1 251.1 vs 1022 \u00b1 244.5, P < .001). Because the SI showed high correlation between the ratio at half dose and full dose (r = 0.875), the formula, ratio of synovial enhancement to saline syringe at full dose = 0.337 + 1.070 \u00d7 ratio of synovial enhancement to saline syringe at half dose, can be used to convert the normalized value of half dose to full dose. However, no difference in RAMRIS (score 0 in 490 of 1026 joints; score 1 in 344; score 2 in 158; and score 3 in 34) or tenosynovitis scores in grading synovitis or tenosynovitis in image quality and in assessment of synovial enhancement was detected between half-dose and full-dose images (P = 1).Postcontrast synovial SIs showed high correlation between half dose and full dose, and image quality was rated identically. Therefore, half-dose gadobenate dimeglumine at 3-T MR imaging may be sufficient for assessing synovitis or tenosynovitis in early RA.",
        "Background Preoperative assessment of pathologic complete response (pCR) in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) is increasingly needed for organ preservation, but large-scale validation of an MRI radiomics model remains lacking. Purpose To evaluate radiomics models based on T2-weighted imaging and diffusion-weighted MRI for predicting pCR after nCRT in LARC and compare their performance with visual assessment by radiologists. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included patients with LARC (clinical stage T3 or higher, positive nodal status, or both) who underwent post-nCRT MRI and elective resection between January 2009 and December 2018. Surgical histopathologic analysis was the reference standard for pCR. Radiomic features were extracted from the volume of interest on T2-weighted images and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps from post-nCRT MRI to generate three models: T2 weighted, ADC, and both T2 weighted and ADC (merged). Radiomics signatures were generated using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator with tenfold cross-validation. Three experienced radiologists independently rated tumor regression grades at MRI and compared these with the radiomics models' diagnostic outcomes. Areas under the curve (AUCs) of the radiomics models and pooled readers were compared by using the DeLong method. Results Among 898 patients, 189 (21%) achieved pCR. The patients were chronologically divided into training (n = 592; mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 59 years \u00b1 12; 388 men) and test (n = 306; mean age, 59 years \u00b1 12; 190 men) sets. The radiomics signatures of the T2-weighted, ADC, and merged models demonstrated AUCs of 0.82, 0.79, and 0.82, respectively, with no evidence of a difference found between the T2-weighted and merged models (P = .49), while the ADC model performed worse than the merged model (P = .02). The T2-weighted model had higher classification performance (AUC, 0.82 vs 0.74 [P = .009]) and sensitivity (80.0% vs 15.6% [P < .001]), but lower specificity (68.4% vs 98.6% [P < .001]) than the pooled performance of the three radiologists. Conclusion An MRI-based radiomics model showed better classification performance than experienced radiologists for diagnosing pathologic complete response in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. \u00a9 RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Purpose To evaluate the impact of accountable care organizations (ACOs) on use of screening mammography in the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP), the largest value-based reimbursement program in U.S.Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval was waived, as the study used publicly available unidentifiable data. Medicare data were retrospectively obtained for participating ACOs from 2012 to 2014. Baseline information and the ACO-20 measure (percentage of women aged 40-69 years who underwent screening mammography within 24 months) were obtained. Negative binomial regression models were used to evaluate baseline and longitudinal mammography use, with stratified analyses performed for year of entry into the ACO, number of beneficiaries, and geographic region. Results A total of 333 ACOs with 5 329 831 Medicare beneficiaries (mean size, 16 006 beneficiaries) participated in the MSSP. Screening use varied across ACOs (median, 63.0%; range, 8.8%-90.3%), with differences found across regions (use was highest in the Midwest [66.6%] and lowest in the South [58.2%], P = .038). A total of 208 ACOs reported longitudinal outcomes, with mean change in screening mammography use of +2.6% (range, -33.2% to +42.2%), with 128 (61.6%) ACOs reporting improvements (incidence rate ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval: 1.02, 1.07) (P = .002). No longitudinal differences in use were seen across regions (P = .078), year of entry (P = .902), number of beneficiaries (P = .814), or total composite quality score (P = .324), nor was there a difference between ACOs that saved money and those that did not (P = .391).

        "To verify the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 in stent-induced hyperplastic tissue from patients with colorectal cancer who received colorectal stents as a bridge to surgery.This prospective study was institutional review board-approved, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Eleven patients (nine men, two women; mean age, 67 years; age range, 53-82 years) with malignant colorectal obstructions who received a colorectal stent between May and December 2010 were included. Tissue specimens were analyzed for MMP-9 and MMP-2 expression. After resection, the tissue was segmented into three parts: tumor tissue, stent-induced tissue hyperplasia, and normal colon tissue. MMP-9 and MMP-2 expression were determined by using zymography, Western blot analysis, and real-time reverse-transcription (qRT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Significance of differences between groups was evaluated with Friedman analysis of variance test. Signed-rank test was used to determine differences between malignant tumor tissue and stent-induced hyperplastic tissue groups.Stent placement was technically successful in all 11 patients. Stent-induced hyperplastic tissues were found in all patients. Zymography (P = .003) and Western blot analysis (P = .008) showed that expression of MMP-9 was higher in malignant tumor tissue and stent-induced hyperplastic tissue groups compared with normal colorectal tissue group, demonstrating significant differences between groups but no significant differences between malignant tumor and stent-induced hyperplastic tissues. As for results of qRT PCR analysis, the stent-induced hyperplastic tissue group showed increases in messenger RNA expression level of MMP-9 compared with the malignant tumor tissue group (50.42-fold \u00b1 66.30 higher).High expression of MMP-9 is closely associated with stent-induced colorectal tissue hyperplasia in patients with colorectal cancer.",
        "Background Chest CT is used in the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and is an important complement to reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. Purpose To investigate the diagnostic value and consistency of chest CT as compared with RT-PCR assay in COVID-19. Materials and Methods This study included 1014 patients in Wuhan, China, who underwent both chest CT and RT-PCR tests between January 6 and February 6, 2020. With use of RT-PCR as the reference standard, the performance of chest CT in the diagnosis of COVID-19 was assessed. In addition, for patients with multiple RT-PCR assays, the dynamic conversion of RT-PCR results (negative to positive, positive to negative) was analyzed as compared with serial chest CT scans for those with a time interval between RT-PCR tests of 4 days or more. Results Of the 1014 patients, 601 of 1014 (59%) had positive RT-PCR results and 888 of 1014 (88%) had positive chest CT scans. The sensitivity of chest CT in suggesting COVID-19 was 97% (95% confidence interval: 95%, 98%; 580 of 601 patients) based on positive RT-PCR results. In the 413 patients with negative RT-PCR results, 308 of 413 (75%) had positive chest CT findings. Of those 308 patients, 48% (103 of 308) were considered as highly likely cases and 33% (103 of 308) as probable cases. At analysis of serial RT-PCR assays and CT scans, the mean interval between the initial negative to positive RT-PCR results was 5.1 days \u00b1 1.5; the mean interval between initial positive to subsequent negative RT-PCR results was 6.9 days \u00b1 2.3. Of the 1014 patients, 60% (34 of 57) to 93% (14 of 15) had initial positive CT scans consistent with COVID-19 before (or parallel to) the initial positive RT-PCR results. Twenty-four of 57 patients (42%) showed improvement on follow-up chest CT scans before the RT-PCR results turned negative. Conclusion Chest CT has a high sensitivity for diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Chest CT may be considered as a primary tool for the current COVID-19 detection in epidemic areas. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020",
        "To evaluate image quality of low-voltage chest computed tomographic (CT) angiography with raw data-based iterative reconstruction (sonogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction) in comparison with image quality of standard-dose standard-voltage filtered back projection (FBP) CT.This prospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and the informed consent requirement was waived. Eighty consecutive patients who were referred for follow-up chest CT angiography underwent reduced-dose CT (hereafter, T2 examination) under technical conditions similar to those of the initial examination (hereafter, T1 examination), except the voltage selection was reduced by 20 kV with adaptation of the tube current to ensure a 50% reduction in CT dose index, and regular FBP was replaced by iterative reconstruction with sonogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction. The two techniques were compared by using paired tests (Student t test, Wilcoxon test, or McNemar test, according to the nature of variables).When compared with standard-dose T1 studies, reduced-dose T2 images showed: (a) significantly less objective noise at the level of the trachea on mediastinal and lung parenchymal images (P < .001) and no significant difference in objective noise at the level of the aorta on mediastinal images (P = .507); (b) significantly higher signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise (P < .001) ratios; (c) similar visual perception of noise on mediastinal (P = .132) and lung (P = .366) images, mainly rated as moderate; and (d) similar overall subjective image quality (P = .405).Raw data-based iterative reconstruction yielded equivalent subjective and improved objective image quality of low-voltage half-dose CT angiograms compared with standard-dose FBP CT images for an average dose-length product of less than 80 mGy \u00b7 cm in this population.http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.12120414/-/DC1.",
        "Purpose To measure the diagnostic yield and false-referral rate (FRR) of staging contrast material\u2013enhanced chest CT based on the clinical stage from contrast-enhanced abdominal CT in patients with colon cancer. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included 1743 patients (mean age, 63.4 years; range, 18\u201396 years) with a diagnosis of colon cancer. The primary outcomes were diagnostic yield and FRR of contrast-enhanced chest CT in the detection of thoracic metastasis. The proportions of patients with occult thoracic metastasis and those undergoing pulmonary metastasectomy for true-positive metastases were key secondary outcomes. The outcomes were stratified according to clinical stage at contrast-enhanced abdominal CT. Results The diagnostic yields in clinical stage 0/I, cII, cIII, and cIV were 0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0%, 0.8%), 1.3% (95% CI: 0.4%, 3.3%), 4.4% (95% CI: 3.0%, 6.1%), and 43.3% (95% CI: 36.8%, 49.9%), respectively. The corresponding FRRs were 5.7% (95% CI: 3.8%, 8.2%), 2.9% (95% CI: 1.3%, 5.5%), 6.7% (95% CI: 5.0%, 8.8%), and 6.1% (95% CI: 3.4%, 10.0%), respectively. The proportions of patients with occult metastasis were 0% (95% CI: 0%, 0.8%), 3.3% (95% CI: 1.6%, 5.9%), 1.5% (95% CI: 0.8%, 2.7%), and 6.1% (95% CI: 3.4%, 10.0%), respectively. The proportion of patients who underwent pulmonary metastasectomy was 0% (none of 474; 95% CI: 0%, 0.8%) for clinical stage 0/I tumors. Conclusion In clinical stages 0 and I, the diagnostic yield of staging contrast-enhanced chest CT in detecting thoracic metastasis was zero. For clinical stages II, III, and IV, contrast-enhanced chest CT as a baseline examination was helpful for the detection of thoracic metastasis and allowed for the possibility of a curative metastasectomy.

        "A 40-year-old woman presented to the outpatient department of our hospital with a 2-year history of abdominal pain, which had worsened in the past few days. There were no other constitutional symptoms; in particular, there was no weight loss or loss of appetite. The serum amylase and serum lipase levels were always within normal limits, even during the current episode. There was no history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, drug use, or trauma. The patient was evaluated at an outside clinic 2 years ago and underwent imaging, including US and dedicated pancreatic CT, which revealed a complex multiseptated noncalcified pancreatic cystic lesion. After CT, the patient underwent endoscopic US, which showed the lesion was suspected to be an infected parasitic cyst; fine-needle aspiration and cytology were not attempted due to the risk of iatrogenic rupture. The patient was advised to undergo surgical resection but declined the procedure and was lost to follow-up for 2 years before her current visit to our facility. On clinical examination, there were no clinically important findings, aside from mild to moderate pain on deep palpation and some shifting dullness that was suggestive of ascites. The patient always remained hemodynamically stable. US-guided ascitic fluid analysis was performed, which revealed amylase levels of 869 IU/L (normal range, 4-234 IU/L).

        "To determine utility of proton density fat fraction (PDFF) measurements for quantifying the liver fat content in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and compare these results with liver biopsy findings.This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board with waivers of informed consent. Between June 2010 and April 2011, 86 patients received a diagnosis of NAFLD. Ten patients did not accept liver biopsy and six patients had contraindications for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Seventy patients were included in this study. Seventy patients with NAFLD (40 men, 30 women; mean age, 44.7 years; range, 16-69 years) underwent T1-independent volumetric multiecho gradient-echo imaging with T2* correction and spectral fat modeling. Median time interval between MR imaging and liver biopsy was 14.5 days (range, 0-259 days). MR examinations were performed with a 1.5-T MR imaging system. Complex-based PDFF measurements were performed by placing regions of interest in Couinaud system segments V-VI and all liver segments from I to VIII. All liver biopsy specimens were retrieved from archives and evaluated by one pathologist for hepatic steatosis according to criteria from a previous study. Pearson correlation coefficient, receiver operating characteristics, and linear regression analyses were used for statistical analyses.Mean PDFF calculated with MR imaging was 18.1% \u00b1 9.5 (standard deviation). Close correlation for quantification of hepatic steatosis was observed between PDFF and liver biopsy (r = 0.82). PDFF was effective in discriminating moderate or severe hepatic steatosis from mild or no hepatic steatosis, with area under the curve of 0.95. The correlation between biopsy and PDFF-determined steatosis was less pronounced when fibrosis was present (r = 0.60) than when fibrosis was absent (r = 0.86; P = .02).PDFF measurement by MR imaging provided a noninvasive, accurate estimation of the presence and grading of hepatic steatosis in patients with NAFLD. Hepatic fibrosis reduced the correlation between biopsy results and PDFF.",
        "Background Previous studies analyzed contrast agent spread during cervical interlaminar epidural steroid injections (CILESIs) by using planar fluoroscopy and reported wide variance of the rate of spread to the ventral epidural space (VES). Cross-sectional CT allows for direct viewing of contrast agent in the VES, providing improved spread assessment and thereby informing needle placement decisions when targeting pain generators. Purpose To determine the extent of injectate spread at CT fluoroscopy-guided CILESI, with particular attention to the VES and bilateral neuroforamina, by using cross-sectional CT. Materials and Methods This study reviewed 83 consecutive CT fluoroscopy-guided CILESIs at which a postprocedural cervical spine CT was performed (June 2016 to December 2017). All procedures used the same injectate (2 mL corticosteroid, 3 mL contrast agent). Postprocedural CT scans were reviewed for the presence of contrast within the VES, dorsal epidural space, ipsilateral neuroforamen, and contralateral neuroforamen in every cervical interlaminar level. Descriptive data are presented as frequencies or means. McNemar tests or hierarchical logistic models were used to assess associations between covariates and contrast agent spread to particular locations. Results The study cohort included 73 individual patients (59% women; 43 of 73) (mean patient age, 57.6 years \u00b1 11.5 [standard deviation]). Mean number of levels of cranial spread were 0.6 level for VES, 1.9 levels for contralateral neuroforamen, 2.1 levels for ipsilateral neuroforamen, and 3 levels for dorsal epidural space. No VES spread in any level was found with 35% (29 of 83) of injections. VES spread was more likely to occur in the level of needle placement (43%; 36 of 83) than in other interlaminar levels (19.5%; 97 of 498;",
        "Purpose To validate ferumoxytol-based quantitative blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) MRI for mapping oxygenation of human infiltrative astrocytomas by using intraoperative measurement of tissue oxygen tension and histologic staining. Materials and Methods Fifteen patients with infiltrative astrocytomas were recruited into this prospective multicenter study between July 2014 and December 2016. Prior to treatment, participants underwent preoperative quantitative BOLD MRI with ferumoxytol to generate tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) maps. Two intratumoral sites were identified, one with low StO2 and one with high StO2. Neuronavigation was used to locate sites intraoperatively for insertion of oxygen-sensing probes to measure local tissue oxygen tension (PtO2). Biopsies from both sites were taken and stained for markers of hypoxia (hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1, carbonic anhydrase IX) and neoangiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor, endoglin [CD105]). Spearman correlation and nonparametric sign-rank tests were used to analyze data. Results Ten patients with median age of 58.5 years (interquartile range, 25 years; four men and six women) completed the study. Because there is no linear relationship between StO2 and PtO2, the ratios of low to high StO2 versus low to high PtO2 in each patient were compared and a significant correlation was found (r = 0.73; P = .01). Pathologic analyses revealed differences between carbonic anhydrase IX (P = .03) for sites of low StO2 versus high StO2. CD105 displayed a similar trend but was not significant (P = .09). Conclusion Ferumoxytol-based quantitative blood oxygenation level-dependent MRI can potentially be used as a noninvasive surrogate for oxygenation mapping in infiltrative astrocytomas. This technique can potentially be integrated in treatment planning for aggressive targeting of hypoxic areas in tumors.",

        "Purpose To determine the relative frequencies of persistence patterns in treated pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) and to assess whether there is a difference in retreatment outcomes between PAVMs persisting via recanalization and those persisting via reperfusion. Materials and Methods Between May 2003 and May 2011, 23 patients (10 male, 13 female; mean age, 44 years \u00b1 18 [standard deviation]; age range, 12\u201372 years) who had PAVM embolization, persistence by computed tomography (CT), and a follow-up pulmonary arteriogram were included. This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board and was fully HIPAA compliant. PAVMs were categorized as having recanalization, defined as persistence maintained by flow through a previously placed coil nest; reperfusion, defined as persistence through small feeders from adjacent normal pulmonary arteries; or incomplete treatment. Fifty-three persistent PAVMs were characterized; 38 of which had postretreatment CT data (median follow-up, 1 year). The retreatment success rate, defined by sac shrinkage on CT images, was assessed. Results Recanalization was the most common pattern, occurring in 91% (n = 48) of 53 PAVMs. Pulmonary-to-pulmonary reperfusion occurred in 24% (n = 13) of 53 PAVMs. Angioarchitecture, coil-sac distance, coil number, and feeder diameter did not significantly differ between recanalized and reperfused PAVMs. There was a significant (P = .014) difference in retreatment success; retreatment was successful in 84% (n = 27) of 32 recanalized PAVMs but only 44% (n = 4) of nine reperfused PAVMs. Conclusion Recanalization through previously placed coils is the most common pattern of PAVM persistence and responds best to retreatment. Pulmonary-to-pulmonary reperfusion is less common and more difficult to re-treat successfully. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Background Macrotrabecular-massive (MTM) subtype of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive variant associated with angiogenesis and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which is expected to be noninvasively identified using radiomics approaches. Purpose To construct a CT radiomics model to predict the MTM subtype and to investigate the underlying immune infiltration patterns. Materials and Methods This study included five retrospective data sets and one prospective data set from three academic medical centers between January 2015 and December 2021. The preoperative liver contrast-enhanced CT studies of 365 adult patients with resected HCC were evaluated. The Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University provided the training set and internal test set, while Yueyang Central Hospital and Hunan Cancer Hospital provided the external test sets. Radiomic features were extracted and used to develop a radiomics model with machine learning in the training set, and the performance was verified in the two test sets. The outcomes cohort, including 58 adult patients with advanced HCC undergoing transarterial chemoembolization and antiangiogenic therapy, was used to evaluate the predictive value of the radiomics model for progression-free survival (PFS). Bulk RNA sequencing of tumors from 41 patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and single-cell RNA sequencing from seven prospectively enrolled participants were used to investigate the radiomics-related immune infiltration patterns. Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of the radiomics model was calculated, and Cox proportional regression was performed to identify predictors of PFS. Results Among 365 patients (mean age, 55 years \u00b1 10 [SD]; 319 men) used for radiomics modeling, 122 (33%) were confirmed to have the MTM subtype. The radiomics model included 11 radiomic features and showed good performance for predicting the MTM subtype, with AUCs of 0.84, 0.80, and 0.74 in the training set, internal test set, and external test set, respectively. A low radiomics model score relative to the median value in the outcomes cohort was independently associated with PFS (hazard ratio, 0.4; 95% CI: 0.2, 0.8; P = .01). The radiomics model was associated with dysregulated humoral immunity involving B-cell infiltration and immunoglobulin synthesis. Conclusion Accurate prediction of the macrotrabecular-massive subtype in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma was achieved using a CT radiomics model, which was also associated with defective humoral immunity.

        "Purpose To determine the feasibility of computed tomography (CT)-based dynamic myocardial perfusion imaging for the detection of hemodynamically significant coronary artery stenosis, as defined with fractional flow reserve (FFR). Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval and informed patient consent were obtained before patient enrollment in the study. The study was HIPAA compliant. Subjects who were suspected of having or were known to have coronary artery disease underwent electrocardiographically triggered dynamic stress myocardial perfusion imaging. FFR measurement was performed within all main coronary arteries with a luminal narrowing of 50%\u201385%. Estimated myocardial blood flow (MBF) was derived from CT images by using a model-based parametric deconvolution method for 16 myocardial segments and was related to hemodynamically significant coronary artery stenosis with an FFR of 0.75 or less in a blinded fashion. Conventional measures of diagnostic accuracy were derived, and discriminatory power analysis was performed by using logistic regression analysis. Results Of 36 enrolled subjects, 33 (mean age, 68.1 years \u00b1 10 [standard deviation]; 25 [76%] men, eight [24%] women) completed the study protocol. An MBF cut point of 75 mL/100 mL/min provided the highest discriminatory power (C statistic, 0.707; P <.001). While the diagnostic accuracy of CT for the detection of anatomically significant coronary artery stenosis (>50%) was high, it was low for the detection of hemodynamically significant stenosis (positive predictive value [PPV] per coronary segment, 49%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 36%, 60%). With use of estimated MBF to reclassify lesions depicted with CT angiography, 30 of 70 (43%) coronary lesions were graded as not hemodynamically significant, which significantly increased PPV to 78% (95% CI: 61%, 89%; P = .02). The presence of a coronary artery stenosis with a corresponding MBF less than 75 mL/100 mL/min had a high risk for hemodynamic significance (odds ratio, 86.9; 95% CI:17.6, 430.4). Conclusion Dynamic CT-based stress myocardial perfusion imaging may allow detection of hemodynamically significant coronary artery stenosis. \u00a9 RSNA, 2011 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.11110638/-/DC1",
        "Background: Sonographic imaging of the pancreas provides information with regards to pancreatic size, echotexture and ductal morphology which are important in the assessment of pancreas in both normal and morbid conditions. There is paucity of literature on these normal values in this environment.\r\nAim and Objective: To determine the normal pancreatic sizes and ductal dimensions among normal adults using Ultrasound in Maiduguri, North-eastern Nigeria.Materials and methods: This was a prospective study which spanned over a period of four months from January to April 2013 on 400 consenting normal adults.\r\nResults: the study revealed normal adults mean pancreatic head, body, tail and duct dimensions of 2.13\u00b123cm, 1.51\u00b10.19cm, 1.80\u00b10.18cm and 2.12\u00b11.42mm respectively. A significant correlation was noted between BMI and all the pancreatic dimensions. Also significant correlation was noted between sex, height and weight with pancreatic duct. No correlation was noted between all the pancreatic dimensions with age.\r\nConclusion: The result of the study will be used as a baseline data for the assessment of pancreatic diseases.",
        "To determine whether adding shear-wave (SW) elastographic features could improve accuracy of ultrasonographic (US) assessment of breast masses.From September 2008 to September 2010, 958 women consented to repeat standard breast US supplemented by quantitative SW elastographic examination in this prospective multicenter institutional review board-approved, HIPAA-compliant protocol. B-mode Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) features and assessments were recorded. SW elastographic evaluation (mean, maximum, and minimum elasticity of stiffest portion of mass and surrounding tissue; lesion-to-fat elasticity ratio; ratio of SW elastographic-to-B-mode lesion diameter or area; SW elastographic lesion shape and homogeneity) was performed. Qualitative color SW elastographic stiffness was assessed independently. Nine hundred thirty-nine masses were analyzable; 102 BI-RADS category 2 masses were assumed to be benign; reference standard was available for 837 category 3 or higher lesions. Considering BI-RADS category 4a or higher as test positive for malignancy, effect of SW elastographic features on area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity after reclassifying category 3 and 4a masses was determined.Median participant age was 50 years; 289 of 939 (30.8%) masses were malignant (median mass size, 12 mm). B-mode BI-RADS AUC was 0.950; eight of 303 (2.6%) BI-RADS category 3 masses, 18 of 193 (9.3%) category 4a lesions, 41 of 97 (42%) category 4b lesions, 42 of 57 (74%) category 4c lesions, and 180 of 187 (96.3%) category 5 lesions were malignant. By using visual color stiffness to selectively upgrade category 3 and lack of stiffness to downgrade category 4a masses, specificity improved from 61.1% (397 of 650) to 78.5% (510 of 650) (P<.001); AUC increased to 0.962 (P=.005). Oval shape on SW elastographic images and quantitative maximum elasticity of 80 kPa (5.2 m/sec) or less improved specificity (69.4% [451 of 650] and 77.4% [503 of 650], P<.001 for both), without significant improvement in sensitivity or AUC.Adding SW elastographic features to BI-RADS feature analysis improved specificity of breast US mass assessment without loss of sensitivity.",
        "To evaluate the integrity of brain cholinergic pathways in vivo in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) by measuring the vesicular acetylcholine transporter expression at single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with [123I]-iodobenzovesamicol.All participants provided informed written consent according to institutional human ethics committee guidelines. Ten patients with PSP and 12 healthy volunteers underwent dynamic [123I]-iodobenzovesamicol SPECT and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. CT and MR images were used to register the dynamic SPECT image to the Montreal Neurologic Institute brain template, which includes the regions of interest of the striatum and the septo-hippocampal, innominato-cortical, and ponto-thalamic cholinergic pathways. For each region of interest, pharmacokinetic modeling of regional time activity curves was used to calculate [123I]-iodobenzovesamicol to vesicular acetylcholine transporter binding potential value, proportional to vesicular acetylcholine transporter expression.When compared with control participants, patients with PSP had binding potential values that were unchanged in the striatum and septohippocampal pathway, significantly lower in the anterior cingulate cortex (P=.017) in the innominatocortical pathway, and significantly decreased in the thalamus (P=.014) in the pontothalamic cholinergic pathway. In addition, binding potential values in the thalamus were positively correlated with those in the pedunculopontine nucleus (\u03c1=0.81, P<.004) and binding potential values in both the thalamus (\u03c1=-0.88, P<.001) and pedunculopontine nucleus (\u03c1=-0.80, P<.010) were inversely correlated with disease duration.Cholinergic pathways were differentially affected in the PSP group, with a significant alteration of pontothalamic pathways that increased with disease progression at both cell body and terminal levels, while the innominatocortical pathway was only mildly affected, and the septohippocampal pathway and the striatum were both preserved.",
        "Purpose To compare screening mammography recall rate, cancer detection rate (CDR), and positive predictive values (PPVs) for digital mammography before and after radiologist experience with digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). Materials and Methods This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board and compliant with HIPAA. The authors reviewed screening mammography audit data obtained from 2009 to 2014, during which 108 276 digital mammographic examinations were performed (50 062 before and 58 214 after experience with DBT). Recall rate, CDR, PPV of positive screening result (PPV1), PPV of biopsy recommendation (PPV2), and PPV of biopsies performed (PPV3) of digital mammography for six radiologists were compared before (2009-2011) and after (2012-2014) experience with DBT. Radiologists worked in both a community setting, in which only digital mammography was available, and in two tertiary breast imaging centers, where they interpreted DBT images starting in 2012. Data were examined by using generalized linear mixed modeling wherein observations were nested for each radiologist over time. P < .05 was considered indicative of a statistically significant difference; 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results The average recall rate was 6.8% (range, 3.6%-9.7%) before experience with DBT and 7.9% (range, 5.5%-9.5%) after (P = .0316). Before experience with DBT, the recall rate increased only 0.01% for each year from 2009 to 2011 (P = .9727). After experience with DBT, the recall rate increased 0.65% for each year from 2012 to 2014 (P < .0127). CDR increased from 2.5 per 1000 examinations (95% CI: 2.2, 2.9) to 3.5 per 1000 examinations (95% CI: 3.0, 4.0; P = .0203). PPV2 and PPV3 increased significantly after experience with DBT, from 26.9% (95% CI: 19.9%, 35.3%) to 36.1% (95% CI: 31.7%, 40.7%; P = .0212) for PPV2 and from 31.2% (95% CI: 24.0%, 39.3%) to 40.0% (95% CI: 35.5%, 44.6%; P = .0290) for PPV3. Conclusion Recall rate, CDR, PPV2, and PPV3 of digital mammography increased after radiologist experience with DBT. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017.",
        "To determine whether placement of marking coils at biopsy of small renal neoplasms to facilitate localization at subsequent radiofrequency (RF) ablation is safe and can reduce fluoroscopy time during the ablative procedure. This retrospective study was approved by the hospital institutional review board and was compliant with HIPAA. The requirement to obtain informed consent was waived. A search of the renal RF ablation database (235 patients) identified 23 consecutive patients who had a marking coil placed at biopsy of a renal neoplasm (coil group) and 23 patients who did not have a marking coil placed at biopsy (control group). The patients were matched for tumor characteristics, including size, parenchymal position, location in the kidney, and laterality. All patients underwent subsequent RF ablation. The authors compared computed tomographic (CT) fluoroscopy times and technical success rates between the two groups. Statistical analyses were performed by using a single-tailed paired t test for comparison of CT fluoroscopy times, a two-tailed paired t test for comparison of age and tumor size, and a single-tailed McNemar test for comparison of the technical success rate of ablation. The mean CT fluoroscopy time for the RF ablation procedure was 28 seconds \u00b1 11.7 (standard deviation) for the coil group and 66 seconds \u00b1 85.8 for the control group (P = .025). There was no significant difference in the technical success rates of renal RF ablation. For small renal neoplasms that are poorly visualized at unenhanced CT, placement of a metallic marking coil at biopsy facilitates tumor localization, thus reducing CT fluoroscopy time and radiation dose for subsequent RF ablation procedures.",
        "To determine if myeloperoxidase (MPO) is involved in epileptogenesis and if molecular nuclear imaging can be used to noninvasively map inflammatory changes in epileptogenesis.The animal and human studies were approved by the institutional review boards. Pilocarpine-induced epileptic mice were treated with 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide (n = 46), a specific irreversible MPO inhibitor, or saline (n = 42). Indium-111-bis-5-hydroxytryptamide-diethylenetriaminepentaacetate was used to image brain MPO activity (n = 6 in the 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide and saline groups; n = 5 in the sham group) by using single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography. The role of MPO in the development of spontaneous recurrent seizures was assessed by means of clinical symptoms and biochemical and histopathologic data. Human brain specimens from a patient with epilepsy and a patient without epilepsy were stained for MPO. The Student t test, one-way analysis of variance, and Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used. Differences were regarded as significant if P was less than .05.MPO and leukocytes increased in the brain during epileptogenesis (P < .05). Blocking MPO delayed spontaneous recurrent seizures (99.6 vs 142 hours, P = .016), ameliorated the severity of spontaneous recurrent seizures (P < .05), and inhibited mossy fiber sprouting (Timm index, 0.31 vs 0.03; P = .003). Matrix metalloproteinase activity was upregulated during epileptogenesis in an MPO-dependent manner (1.44 vs 0.94 U/mg, P = .049), suggesting that MPO acts upstream of matrix metalloproteinases. MPO activity was mapped during epileptogenesis in vivo in the hippocampal regions. Resected temporal lobe tissue from a human patient with refractory epilepsy but not the temporal lobe tissue from a patient without seizures demonstrated positive MPO immunostaining, suggesting high translational potential for this imaging technology.The findings of this study highlight an important role for MPO in epileptogenesis and show MPO to be a potential therapeutic target and imaging biomarker for epilepsy.",
        "History A 28-year-old man presented with lifelong anejaculation, which had become an issue because of family planning. The patient had a history of normal erections and experienced the sensation of orgasm without ever ejaculating. On physical examination, both testes were present in the scrotum, with normal dimensions and a normal epididymis bilaterally. The patient had a slightly tender left testicle, and digital rectal examination findings were normal. The patient underwent further investigation for the possibility of retrograde ejaculation with urine cytology, the results of which were negative. Genetic testing was performed to exclude Y chromosome microdeletions. Serum-luteinizing and follicle-stimulating hormone levels were normal, with a borderline low level of testosterone (7.6 nmol/L; normal range, 8.0-29.0 nmol/L). All other pertinent laboratory results were noncontributory. Pelvic MRI was requested to exclude an anatomic cause of anejaculation. MRI was performed in accordance with the standard clinical prostate protocol, with a dynamic contrast material-enhanced study. CT of the upper abdomen was also performed. The patient subsequently underwent cystoscopy, which revealed an intravesicular fluid-filled mass near the left ureteric orifice.",
        "Purpose To develop and evaluate a fully automated algorithm for segmenting the abdomen from CT to quantify body composition. Materials and Methods For this retrospective study, a convolutional neural network based on the U-Net architecture was trained to perform abdominal segmentation on a data set of 2430 two-dimensional CT examinations and was tested on 270 CT examinations. It was further tested on a separate data set of 2369 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). CT examinations were performed between 1997 and 2015. The mean age of patients was 67 years; for male patients, it was 67 years (range, 29-94 years), and for female patients, it was 66 years (range, 31-97 years). Differences in segmentation performance were assessed by using two-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction. Results Compared with reference segmentation, the model for this study achieved Dice scores (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) of 0.98 \u00b1 0.03, 0.96 \u00b1 0.02, and 0.97 \u00b1 0.01 in the test set, and 0.94 \u00b1 0.05, 0.92 \u00b1 0.04, and 0.98 \u00b1 0.02 in the HCC data set, for the subcutaneous, muscle, and visceral adipose tissue compartments, respectively. Performance met or exceeded that of expert manual segmentation. Conclusion Model performance met or exceeded the accuracy of expert manual segmentation of CT examinations for both the test data set and the hepatocellular carcinoma data set.

        "Purpose To prospectively compare traditional filtered back projection (FBP) and iterative image reconstruction for the evaluation of heavily calcified arteries with coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography. Materials and Methods The study had institutional review board approval and was HIPAA compliant. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Fifty-five consecutive patients (35 men, 20 women; mean age, 58 years \u00b1 12 [standard deviation]) with Agatston scores of at least 400 underwent coronary CT angiography and cardiac catheterization. Image data were reconstructed with both FBP and iterative reconstruction techniques with corresponding cardiac algorithms. Image noise and subjective image quality were compared. To objectively assess the effect of FBP and iterative reconstruction on blooming artifacts, volumes of circumscribed calcifications were measured with dedicated volume analysis software. FBP and iterative reconstruction series were independently evaluated for coronary artery stenosis greater than 50%, and their diagnostic accuracy was compared, with cardiac catheterization as the reference standard. Statistical analyses included paired t tests, Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance, and a modified McNemar test. Results Image noise measured significantly lower (P = .011\u2013.035) with iterative reconstruction instead of FBP. Image quality was rated significantly higher (P = .031 and .042) with iterative reconstruction series than with FBP. Calcification volumes measured significantly lower (P = .019 and .026) with iterative reconstruction (44.3 mm3 \u00b1 64.7 and 46.2 mm3 \u00b1 68.8) than with FBP (54.5 mm3 \u00b1 69.5 and 56.3 mm3 \u00b1 72.5). Iterative reconstruction significantly improved some measures of per-segment diagnostic accuracy of coronary CT angiography for the detection of significant stenosis compared with FBP (accuracy: 95.9% vs 91.8%, P = .0001; specificity: 95.8% vs 91.2%, P = .0001; positive predictive value: 76.9% vs 61.1%, P = .0001).

        "Purpose To determine the utility of cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) T1 mapping for quantification of diffuse myocardial fibrosis compared with the standard of endomyocardial biopsy. Materials and Methods This HIPAA-compliant study was approved by the institutional review board. Cardiomyopathy patients were retrospectively identified who had undergone endomyocardial biopsy and cardiac MR at one institution during a 5-year period. Forty-seven patients (53% male; mean age, 46.8 years) had undergone diagnostic cardiac MR and endomyocardial biopsy. Thirteen healthy volunteers (54% male; mean age, 38.1 years) underwent cardiac MR as a reference. Myocardial T1 mapping was performed 10.7 minutes \u00b1 2.7 (standard deviation) after bolus injection of 0.2 mmol/kg gadolinium chelate by using an inversion-recovery Look-Locker sequence on a 1.5-T MR imager. Late gadolinium enhancement was assessed by using gradient-echo inversion-recovery sequences. Cardiac MR results were the consensus of two radiologists who were blinded to histopathologic findings. Endomyocardial biopsy fibrosis was quantitatively measured by using automated image analysis software with digital images of specimens stained with Masson trichrome. Histopathologic findings were reported by two pathologists blinded to cardiac MR findings. Statistical analyses included Mann-Whitney U test, analysis of variance, and linear regression. Results Median myocardial fibrosis was 8.5% (interquartile range, 5.7\u201314.4). T1 times were greater in control subjects than in patients without and in patients with evident late gadolinium enhancement (466 msec \u00b1 14, 406 msec \u00b1 59, and 303 msec \u00b1 53, respectively; P < .001). T1 time and histologic fibrosis were inversely correlated (r = \u22120.57; 95% confidence interval: \u22120.74, \u22120.34; P < .0001). The area under the curve for myocardial T1 time to detect fibrosis of greater than 5% was 0.84 at a cutoff of 383 msec. Conclusion Cardiac MR with T1 mapping can provide noninvasive evidence of diffuse myocardial fibrosis in patients referred for evaluation of cardiomyopathy. \u00a9 RSNA, 2012",
        "Purpose To compare the low-contrast detectability and image quality of computed tomography (CT) at different radiation dose levels reconstructed with iterative reconstruction (IR) and filtered back projection (FBP). Materials and Methods A custom liver phantom with 12 simulated hypoattenuating tumors (diameters of 5, 10, 15, and 20 mm; tumor-to-liver contrast values of \u221210, \u221220, and \u221240 HU) was designed. The phantom was scanned with a standard abdominal CT protocol with a volume CT dose index of 21.6 mGy (equivalent 100% dose) and four low-dose protocols (20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% of the standard protocol dose). CT data sets were reconstructed with IR and FBP. Image noise was measured, and the tumors' contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were calculated. Tumor detection was independently assessed by three radiologists who were blinded to the CT technique used. A total of 840 simulated tumors were presented to the radiologists. Statistical analyses included analysis of variance. Results IR yielded an image noise reduction of 43.9%\u201363.9% and a CNR increase of 74.1%\u2013180% compared with FBP at the same dose level (P < .001). The overall sensitivity for tumor detection was 64.7%\u201385.3% for IR and 66.3%\u201385.7% for FBP at the 20%\u2013100% doses, respectively. There was no significant difference in the sensitivity for tumor detection between IR and FBP at the same dose level (P = .99). The sensitivity of the protocol at the 20% dose with FBP and IR was significantly lower than that of the protocol at the 100% dose with FBP and IR (P = .019). Conclusion As the radiation dose at CT decreases, the IR algorithm does not preserve the low-contrast detectability. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Supplemental material:S1",
        "Purpose To investigate whether multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) developed for deep-tissue imaging in humans could enable the clinical assessment of major blood vessels and microvasculature. Materials and Methods The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University Medical Center Groningen (CCMO-NL-43587) and registered in the Dutch National Trial Registry (NTR4125). The authors designed a real-time handheld optoacoustic scanner for human use, based on a concave 8-MHz transducer array, attaining 135\u00b0 angular coverage. They applied a single-pulse-frame (SPF) sequence, which enabled motion insensitive optoacoustic imaging during handheld operation. SPF optoacoustic imaging was applied to imaging arteries and microvascular landmarks in the lower extremities of 10 healthy volunteers. The diameters selected microvessels were determined by measuring the full width at half maximum through the vessels in the MSOT images. Duplex ultrasonography was performed on the same landmarks in seven of the 10 volunteers for subjective comparison to the corresponding optoacoustic images. Results Optoacoustic imaging resolved blood vessels as small as 100 \u00b5m in diameter and within 1 cm depth. Additionally, MSOT provided images reflecting hemoglobin oxygen saturation in blood vessels, clearly identifying arteries and veins, and was able to identify pulsation in arteries during imaging. Larger blood vessels, specifically the tibialis posterior and the dorsalis pedis arteries, were also visualized with MSOT. Conclusion Handheld MSOT was found to be capable of clinical vascular imaging, providing visualization of major blood vessels and microvasculature and providing images of hemoglobin oxygen saturation and pulsation. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016",
        "Purpose To prospectively validate predefined breast ultrasonographic (US) Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) category 3 criteria in a multicenter setting in an elevated-risk population. Materials and Methods The American College of Radiology Imaging Network 6666 database was reviewed for prospectively defined BI-RADS category 3 lesions. Patient characteristics, lesion US features at initial detection, and work-up recommendations were analyzed with descriptive statistics. Exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were given, where appropriate. Lesion reference standard was biopsy or a minimum of 1-year follow-up. In addition, malignancy rate for lesions that had at least 2 years of follow-up data or that had biopsy data was calculated. Results Of 2662 participants, 519 (19.5%) had 745 BI-RADS category 3 lesions (25.5% of 2916 US lesions other than simple cysts), with a median size of 7 mm (range, 2\u2013135 mm). The number of new BI-RADS category 3 lesions decreased with year 2\u20133 screening, but the percentage of new BI-RADS category 3 lesions was stable at 26.4% (506 of 1920 lesions), 23.6% (142 of 601 lesions), and 24.6% (97 of 395 lesions), respectively. Of 745 BI-RADS category 3 lesions, 124 (16.6%) were ultimately sampled for biopsy. Six malignancies (0.8% of BI-RADS category 3 lesions; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.3%, 1.7%) occurred in five (1.0%) of 519 participants: Five malignancies were invasive (median size, 10 mm; size range, 2\u201318 mm), and one was node positive. When the analysis is limited to lesions with at least 2-year follow-up or biopsy, the malignancy rate among BI-RADS category 3 lesions is 0.9% (95% CI: 0.3%, 2.0%). Three malignant BI-RADS category 3 lesions were sampled for biopsy because of a suspicious change at follow-up (two N0 lesions, one each at 6- and 12-month follow-up; one N1 lesion at 24-month follow-up), one was sampled for biopsy because of an upgrade after additional mammography (NX), one was found at mastectomy for another cancer (N0), and one was found at prophylactic contralateral mastectomy in the same patient (NX). Conclusion As BI-RADS category 3 lesions have a low malignancy rate (0.8%; 95% CI: 0.3%, 1.7%) and only 0.1% of the cancers had suspicious changes at 6-month follow-up and only one (17%; 95% CI: 0.4%, 64%) of six malignancies were node positive at detection (24-month follow-up), a recommendation of 1-year diagnostic follow-up may be appropriate for BI-RADS category 3 lesions detected at screening US. \u00a9RSNA, 2013 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Background Opening of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) induced with MRI-guided focused ultrasound has been shown in experimental animal models to reduce amyloid-\u03b2 plaque burden, improve memory performance, and facilitate delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain. However, physiologic effects of this procedure in humans with Alzheimer disease (AD) require further investigation. Purpose To assess imaging effects of focused ultrasound\u2013induced BBB opening in the hippocampus of human participants with early AD and to evaluate fluid flow patterns after BBB opening by using serial contrast-enhanced MRI. Materials and Methods Study participants with early AD recruited to a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act\u2013compliant, prospective, ongoing phase II clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT03671889) underwent three separate focused ultrasound\u2013induced BBB opening procedures that used a 220-kHz transducer with a concomitant intravenous microbubble contrast agent administered at 2-week intervals targeting the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex between October 2018 and May 2019. Posttreatment effects and gadolinium-based contrast agent enhancement patterns were evaluated by using 3.0-T MRI. Results Three women (aged 61, 72, and 73 years) consecutively enrolled in the trial successfully completed repeated focused ultrasound\u2013induced BBB opening of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Postprocedure contrast enhancement was clearly identified within the targeted brain volumes, indicating immediate spatially precise BBB opening. Parenchymal enhancement resolved within 24 hours after all treatments, confirming BBB closure. Transient perivenous enhancement was consistently observed during the acute phase after BBB opening. Notably, contrast enhancement reappeared in the perivenular regions after BBB closure. This imaging marker is consistent with blood-meningeal barrier permeability and persisted for 24\u201348 hours before spontaneous resolution. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or other adverse effect was identified. Conclusion MRI-guided focused ultrasound\u2013induced blood-brain barrier opening was safely performed in the hippocampi of three participants with Alzheimer disease without any adverse effects. Posttreatment MRI reveals a unique spatiotemporal contrast enhancement pattern that suggests a perivenular immunologic healing response downstream from targeted sites. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Background Fetal MRI-based differential diagnosis of congenital lung malformations is difficult because of the paucity of well-described imaging markers. Purpose To characterize the hyperintense bronchus sign (HBS) in in vivo fetal MRI of congenital lung malformation cases. Materials and Methods In this retrospective two-center study, fetal MRI scans obtained in fetuses with congenital lung malformations at US (January 2002 to September 2018) were reviewed for the HBS, a tubular or branching hyperintense structure within a lung lesion on T2-weighted images. The frequency of the HBS and respective gestational ages in weeks and days were analyzed. Areas under the curve (AUCs), 95% CIs, and P values of the HBS regarding airway obstruction, as found in histopathologic and postnatal CT findings as the reference standards, were calculated for different gestational ages. Results A total of 177 fetuses with congenital lung malformations (95 male fetuses) and 248 fetal MRI scans obtained at a median gestational age of 25.6 weeks (interquartile range, 8.9 weeks) were included. The HBS was found in 79% (53 of 67) of fetuses with bronchial atresia, 71% (39 of 55) with bronchopulmonary sequestration (BPS), 43% (three of seven) with hybrid lesion, 15% (six of 40) with congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation, and 13% (one of eight) with bronchogenic cyst at a median gestational age of 24.9 weeks (interquartile range, 9.7 weeks). HBS on MRI scans at any gestational age had an AUC of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.83; P = .04) for the presence of isolated or BPS-associated airway obstruction at histopathologic analysis and postnatal CT. The AUC of HBS on fetal MRI scans obtained until gestational age of 26 weeks (AUC, 0.83; 95% CI: 0.75, 0.91; P < .001) was significantly higher (P = .045) than that for fetal MRI scans obtained after gestational age 26 weeks (AUC, 0.69; 95% CI: 0.57, 0.80; P = .004). Conclusion The hyperintense bronchus sign is a frequently detectable feature at fetal MRI and is associated with airway obstruction particularly before gestational age 26 weeks. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Purpose To compare the recently proposed Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) scale that incorporates fixed criteria and a standard Likert scale based on overall impression in prostate cancer localization using multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Materials and Methods This retrospective study was HIPAA compliant and institutional review board approved. Seventy patients who underwent 3-T pelvic MR imaging, including T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and dynamic contrast material\u2013enhanced imaging, with a pelvic phased-array coil before radical prostatectomy were included. Three radiologists, each with 6 years of experience, independently scored 18 regions (12 peripheral zone [PZ], six transition zone [TZ]) using PI-RADS (range, scores 3\u201315) and Likert (range, scores 1\u20135) scales. Logistic regression for correlated data was used to compare scales for detection of tumors larger than 3 mm in maximal diameter at prostatectomy. Results Maximal accuracy was achieved with score thresholds of 8 and higher and of 3 and higher for PI-RADS and Likert scales, respectively. At these thresholds, in the PZ, similar accuracy was achieved with the PI-RADS scale and the Likert scale for radiologist 1 (89.0% vs 88.2%, P = .223) and radiologist 3 (88.5% vs 88.2%, P = .739) and greater accuracy was achieved with the PI-RADS scale than the Likert scale for radiologist 2 (89.6% vs 87.1%, P = .008). In the TZ, accuracy was lower with the PI-RADS scale than with the Likert scale for radiologist 1 (70.0% vs 87.1%, P < .001), radiologist 2 (87.6% vs 92.6%, P = .002), and radiologist 3 (82.9% vs 91.2%, P < .001). For tumors with Gleason score of at least 7, sensitivity was higher with the PI-RADS scale than with the Likert scale for radiologist 1 (88.6% vs 82.6%, P = .032), and sensitivity was similar for radiologist 2 (78.0% vs 76.5, P = .467) and radiologist 3 (77.3% vs 81.1%, P = .125). Conclusion Radiologists performed well with both PI-RADS and Likert scales for tumor localization, although, in the TZ, performance was better with the Likert scale than the PI-RADS scale. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Supplemental material: S1",
        "Background Despite its high sensitivity in diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a screening population, the chest CT appearance of COVID-19 pneumonia is thought to be nonspecific. Purpose To assess the performance of radiologists in the United States and China in differentiating COVID-19 from viral pneumonia at chest CT. Materials and Methods In this study, 219 patients with positive COVID-19, as determined with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and abnormal chest CT findings, were retrospectively identified from seven Chinese hospitals in Hunan Province, China, from January 6 to February 20, 2020. Two hundred five patients with positive respiratory pathogen panel results for viral pneumonia and CT findings consistent with or highly suspicious for pneumonia, according to original radiologic interpretation within 7 days of each other, were identified from Rhode Island Hospital in Providence, RI. Three radiologists from China reviewed all chest CT scans (n = 424) blinded to RT-PCR findings to differentiate COVID-19 from viral pneumonia. A sample of 58 age-matched patients was randomly selected and evaluated by four radiologists from the United States in a similar fashion. Different CT features were recorded and compared between the two groups. Results For all chest CT scans (n = 424), the accuracy of the three radiologists from China in differentiating COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia was 83% (350 of 424), 80% (338 of 424), and 60% (255 of 424). In the randomly selected sample (n = 58), the sensitivities of three radiologists from China and four radiologists from the United States were 80%, 67%, 97%, 93%, 83%, 73%, and 70%, respectively. The corresponding specificities of the same readers were 100%, 93%, 7%, 100%, 93%, 93%, and 100%, respectively. Compared with non-COVID-19 pneumonia, COVID-19 pneumonia was more likely to have a peripheral distribution (80% vs 57%, P < .001), ground-glass opacity (91% vs 68%, P < .001), fine reticular opacity (56% vs 22%, P < .001), and vascular thickening (59% vs 22%, P < .001), but it was less likely to have a central and peripheral distribution (14% vs 35%, P < .001), pleural effusion (4% vs 39%, P < .001), or lymphadenopathy (3% vs 10%, P = .002).

        "To compare diagnostic accuracy of T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with that of multiparametric (MP) MR imaging combining T2-weighted imaging with diffusion-weighted (DW) MR imaging, dynamic contrast material-enhanced (DCE) MR imaging, or both in the detection of locally recurrent prostate cancer (PCa) after radiation therapy (RT).This retrospective HIPAA-compliant study was approved by the institutional review board; informed consent was waived. Fifty-three men (median age, 70 years) suspected of having post-RT recurrence of PCa underwent MP MR imaging, including DW and DCE sequences, within 6 months after biopsy. Two readers independently evaluated the likelihood of PCa with a five-point scale for T2-weighted imaging alone, T2-weighted imaging with DW imaging, T2-weighted imaging with DCE imaging, and T2-weighted imaging with DW and DCE imaging, with at least a 4-week interval between evaluations. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated. Interreader agreement was assessed, and quantitative parameters (apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC], volume transfer constant [K(trans)], and rate constant [k(ep)]) were assessed at sextant- and patient-based levels with generalized estimating equations and the Wilcoxon rank sum test, respectively.At biopsy, recurrence was present in 35 (66%) of 53 patients. In detection of recurrent PCa, T2-weighted imaging with DW imaging yielded higher AUCs (reader 1, 0.79-0.86; reader 2, 0.75-0.81) than T2-weighted imaging alone (reader 1, 0.63-0.67; reader 2, 0.46-0.49 [P \u2264 .014 for all]). DCE sequences did not contribute significant incremental value to T2-weighted imaging with DW imaging (reader 1, P > .99; reader 2, P = .35). Interreader agreement was higher for combinations of MP MR imaging than for T2-weighted imaging alone (\u03ba = 0.34-0.63 vs \u03ba = 0.17-0.20). Medians of quantitative parameters differed significantly (P < .0001 to P = .0233) between benign tissue and PCa (ADC, 1.64 \u00d7 10(-3) mm(2)/sec vs 1.13 \u00d7 10(-3) mm(2)/sec; K(trans), 0.16 min(-1) vs 0.33 min(-1); k(ep), 0.36 min(-1) vs 0.62 min(-1)).MP MR imaging has greater accuracy in the detection of recurrent PCa after RT than T2-weighted imaging alone, with no additional benefit if DCE is added to T2-weighted imaging and DW imaging.",
        "Multifoetal gestations present a serious public health challenge due to its unique complications. Research findings in this regard especially in the setting of this study are scarce. The adoption of prenatal ultrasound for this study is because it is safe, available and does not employ ionising radiation.An initial 500 which was increased to 2,000 consenting patients but which reduced to 1989 due to attrition were scanned twice (after 10weeks GA and from 28weeks GA) over a 2 year period. The initial increase was to improve the power of the findings. 85 patients had multiple gestations.The prevalence rate was 4.3% with a rate of 41 per 1000 and 2 per 1000 deliveries in twin and triplets respectively. Increasing age, positive family history and fertility treatment were established predisposing factors to multiple pregnancies. 10 cases of foetal complications were observed. 8(80%) of these cases were found in patients on assisted reproductory treatment whereas 2(20%) were found in the naturally conceiving ones. The remaining 75 had no complications. Similarly, maternal complications occurred more in the patients on assisted reproductory treatment (51.8%) as against 48.2% in the latter group.",

The imaging findings, clinical data, and laboratory data were evaluated.ResultsFifty of 51 patients (98%) had a history of contact with individuals from the endemic center in Wuhan, China. Fever (49 of 51, 96%) and cough (24 of 51, 47%) were the most common symptoms. Most patients had a normal white blood cell count (37 of 51, 73%), neutrophil count (44 of 51, 86%), and either normal (17 of 51, 35%) or reduced (33 of 51, 65%) lymphocyte count. CT images showed pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) in 39 of 51 (77%) patients and GGO with reticular and/or interlobular septal thickening in 38 of 51 (75%) patients. GGO with consolidation was present in 30 of 51 (59%) patients, and pure consolidation was present in 28 of 51 (55%) patients. Forty-four of 51 (86%) patients had bilateral lung involvement, while 41 of 51 (80%) involved the posterior part of the lungs and 44 of 51 (86%) were peripheral. There were more consolidated lung lesions in patients 5 days or more from disease onset to CT scan versus 4 days or fewer (431 of 712 lesions vs 129 of 612 lesions; P < .001).

        "Purpose To evaluate whether completeness of reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses in major radiology journals has changed since publication of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement; a secondary objective is to evaluate whether completeness of reporting (ie, PRISMA) is associated with study quality (ie, Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews [AMSTAR]). Materials and Methods Systematic reviews and meta-analyses published in major radiology journals between January 2007 and December 2011 were identified by searching MEDLINE with the modified Montori method. Studies were reviewed independently by two investigators and assessed for adherence to the AMSTAR and PRISMA checklists. The average results were analyzed to assess for change in mean score before and after PRISMA publication and to assess results over time; a Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated to assess for any association between PRISMA and AMSTAR results. Results Included were 130 studies from 11 journals. Average PRISMA and AMSTAR results were 21.8 of 27 and 7.2 of 11, respectively. The average result was higher after publication of PRISMA, and PRISMA-reported items were 22.6 of 27 after publication of PRISMA versus 20.9 of 27 before publication of PRISMA; AMSTAR results were 7.7 of 11 after publication of PRISMA versus 6.7 of 11 before publication of PRISMA. There was a strong positive correlation (r = 0.86) between the PRISMA and AMSTAR results. There was high variability between journals. Radiology had the highest PRISMA reported items (24.7 of 27), and American Journal of Neuroradiology had the lowest (19.6 of 27). Two major areas for improvement include study protocol registration and assessment of risk of bias across studies (ie, publication bias). Conclusion In major radiology journal studies, there was modest improvement in completeness of reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, assessed by PRISMA, which was strongly associated with higher study quality, assessed by AMSTAR. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Supplemental material: S1 Erratum in: https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.14144019",

        "Purpose To develop a positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance (MR) imaging protocol for evaluation of the brain, heart, and joints of pediatric cancer survivors for chemotherapy-induced injuries in one session. Materials and Methods Three teams of experts in neuroimaging, cardiac imaging, and bone imaging were tasked to develop a 20-30-minute PET/MR imaging protocol for detection of chemotherapy-induced tissue injuries of the brain, heart, and bone. In an institutional review board-approved, HIPAA-compliant, prospective study from April to July 2016, 10 pediatric cancer survivors who completed chemotherapy underwent imaging of the brain, heart, and bone with a 3-T PET/MR imager. Cumulative chemotherapy doses and clinical symptoms were correlated with the severity of MR imaging abnormalities by using linear regression analyses. MR imaging measures of brain perfusion and metabolism were compared among eight patients who were treated with methotrexate and eight untreated age-matched control subjects by using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Results Combined brain, heart, and bone examinations were completed within 90 minutes. Eight of 10 cancer survivors had abnormal findings on brain, heart, and bone images, including six patients with and two patients without clinical symptoms. Cumulative chemotherapy doses correlated significantly with MR imaging measures of left ventricular ejection fraction and end-systolic volume, but not with the severity of brain or bone abnormalities. Methotrexate-treated cancer survivors had significantly lower cerebral blood flow and metabolic activity in key brain areas compared with control subjects. Conclusion The feasibility of a single examination for assessment of chemotherapy-induced injuries of the brain, heart, and joints was shown. Earlier detection of tissue injuries may enable initiation of timely interventions and help to preserve long-term health of pediatric cancer survivors. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Background Choroid plexuses (CPs) have been suggested as a key gateway for inflammation in experimental autoimmune encephalitis, but in vivo evidence of their involvement in multiple sclerosis (MS) is lacking. Purpose To assess CP volumetric and inflammatory changes in patients with MS versus healthy control participants. Materials and Methods This was a secondary analysis of 97 patients (61 with relapsing-remitting MS [RRMS] and 36 with progressive MS) and 44 healthy control participants who participated in three prospective 3.0-T brain MRI studies between May 2009 and September 2017. A subgroup of 37 patients and 19 healthy control participants also underwent translocator protein fluorine 18 (18F)\u2013DPA-714 PET for neuroinflammation. Relapses and disability scores were collected at baseline and over 2 years. CPs were manually segmented on three-dimensional T1-weighted images; other brain volumes were additionally segmented. Volumes were expressed as a ratio of intracranial volume. The 18F-DPA-714 distribution volume ratio was quantified in parenchymal regions, whereas standardized uptake value was used for CP inflammation. Multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to assess CP volumetric and inflammatory differences between patients with MS and healthy control participants and correlations between CP volume and lesion load, brain volumes, 18F-DPA-714 uptake, and annualized relapse rate. Results Ninety-seven patients with MS (mean age, 42 years \u00b1 12 [standard deviation]; 49 women) and 44 healthy control participants (mean age, 39 years \u00b1 14; 23 women) underwent MRI. Thirty-seven patients with MS and 19 healthy control participants underwent PET. CPs were 35% larger in patients with MS (mean value, 15.9 \u00d7 10\u22124 \u00b1 4.5) than in healthy control participants (mean value, 11.8 \u00d7 10\u22124 \u00b1 3.8; P = .004). Subgroup analysis confirmed greater CP volume in patients with RRMS (mean value, 15.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 \u00b1 4.6; P = .008) than in healthy control participants. CP enlargement was greater in patients with active lesions at MRI (mean volume, 18.2 \u00d7 10\u22124 \u00b1 4.9 in patients with lesions that enhanced with gadolinium vs 14.9 \u00d7 10\u22124 \u00b1 4 in patients with lesions that did not enhance with gadolinium; P < .001) and correlated with white matter lesion load (r = 0.39; 95% CI: 0.20, 0.55; P < .001) and 18F-DPA-714 binding in the thalami (r = 0.44; 95% CI: 0.22, 0.72; P = .04) and normal-appearing white matter (r = 0.5; 95% CI: 0.20, 0.71; P = .005). Moreover, it correlated with annualized relapse rate in patients with RRMS (r = 0.37; 95% CI: 0.1, 0.55; P = .005). Finally, patients with MS showed 18.5% higher CP 18F-DPA-714 uptake than control participants (mean value, 0.778 \u00b1 0.23 vs 0.635 \u00b1 0.15, respectively; P = .01). CP volume in patients with RRMS (r = 0.57; 95% CI: 0.37, 0.73; P = .009) correlated with higher 18F-DPA-714 uptake. Conclusion Choroid plexuses (CPs) are enlarged and inflamed in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), particularly in those with relapsing-remitting MS with inflammatory profiles; CP volumetric analysis could represent an MS imaging marker. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 EudraCT no. 2008-004174-40; clinical trial registration nos.

        "BACKGROUND\r\nHydrocephalus is a condition in which excess fluid accumulates in the brain resulting in dilatation of the ventricles. The prognosis of hydrocephalus depends on the cause and severity of the condition. Computed tomography (CT) is one of the imaging modalities used for diagnosis and evaluation of treatment options as well as for follow up and monitoring of the patients.\r\nAIM AND OBJECTIVES\r\nThis study is aimed at documenting CT findings of hydrocephalus in children at Usmanu Danfodiyo University Teaching Hospital (UDUTH) Sokoto. Specific objectives were to determine the common causes of hydrocephalus, compare the incidence of congenital and acquired hydrocephalus and determine the degree of cerebral mantle thickness in different forms of hydrocephalus in children.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was a four year (January 2009 \u2013 December 2013) retrospective study of 100 consecutive children with clinical and/or Computarized Tomographic (CT) diagnosis of hydrocephalus who had CT scan at the Radiology Department of UDUTH Sokoto, North Western Nigeria.\r\nData and the images were retrieved from the departmental archives andpatient\u2019s case folders. These data regarding the demographics of patients, clinical history and examination, cranial CT findings and radiological measurements namely cerebral mantle thickness, frontal horn distance and internal skull diameter were entered into the proforma. Data was analyzed using SPSS statistical software package version 20. Analysis of quantitative and qualitative data was made using frequency, mean and standard deviation followed by inferential statistics using Chi square and independent t test to determine associations in categorical and continuous variables respectively.RESULTS\r\nThe age range of patients was from 5 days to 14 years. The male/female ratio was 1.6:1. Congenital hydrocephalus accounted for 54% while acquired hydrocephalus occured in 46%. Non communicating hydrocephalus was the predominant form of hydrocephalus accounting for 59% while communicating hydrocephalus occured in 41% of patients. Aqueductal stenosis (32%) was the commonest cause of hydrocephalus followed by post meningitic hydrocephalus (22%) and intracranial tumours (16%) respectively. The mean cerebral mantle thickness was 17.5mm and 16.6mm for the right and left side respectively with10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore thinning recorded in non communicating hydrocephalus than communicating hydrocephalus.CONCLUSIONThis study shows that congenital hydrocephalus is the predominant type in the study population. Aqueductal stenosis was the commonest cause of hydrocephalus.",
        "Purpose To determine the type and frequency of errors during vascular interventional radiology (VIR) and design and implement an intervention to reduce error and improve efficiency in this setting. Materials and Methods Ethical guidance was sought from the Research Services Department at Imperial College London. Informed consent was not obtained. Field notes were recorded during 55 VIR procedures by a single observer. Two blinded assessors identified failures from field notes and categorized them into one or more errors by using a 22-part classification system. The potential to cause harm, disruption to procedural flow, and preventability of each failure was determined. A preprocedural team rehearsal (PPTR) was then designed and implemented to target frequent preventable potential failures. Thirty-three procedures were observed subsequently to determine the efficacy of the PPTR. Nonparametric statistical analysis was used to determine the effect of intervention on potential failure rates, potential to cause harm and procedural flow disruption scores (Mann-Whitney U test), and number of preventable failures (Fisher exact test). Results Before intervention, 1197 potential failures were recorded, of which 54.6% were preventable. A total of 2040 errors were deemed to have occurred to produce these failures. Planning error (19.7%), staff absence (16.2%), equipment unavailability (12.2%), communication error (11.2%), and lack of safety consciousness (6.1%) were the most frequent errors, accounting for 65.4% of the total. After intervention, 352 potential failures were recorded. Classification resulted in 477 errors. Preventable failures decreased from 54.6% to 27.3% (P < .001) with implementation of PPTR. Potential failure rates per hour decreased from 18.8 to 9.2 (P < .001), with no increase in potential to cause harm or procedural flow disruption per failure. Conclusion Failures during VIR procedures are largely because of ineffective planning, communication error, and equipment difficulties, rather than a result of technical or patient-related issues. Many of these potential failures are preventable. A PPTR is an effective means of targeting frequent preventable failures, reducing procedural delays and improving patient safety. \u00a9 RSNA, 2012",
        "Purpose To apply quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) in the basal ganglia of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and relate the findings to R2* mapping with regard to the sensitivity for clinical and morphologic measures of disease severity. Materials and Methods The local ethics committee approved this study, and all subjects gave written informed consent. Sixty-eight patients (26 with clinically isolated syndrome, 42 with relapsing-remitting MS) and 23 control subjects underwent 3-T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Susceptibility and R2* maps were reconstructed from the same three-dimensional multiecho spoiled gradient-echo sequence. Mean susceptibilities and R2* rates were measured in the basal ganglia and were compared between different phenotypes of the disease (clinically isolated syndrome, MS) and the control subjects by using analysis of variance, and regressing analysis was used to identify independent predictors. Results Compared with control subjects, patients with MS and clinically isolated syndrome had increased (more paramagnetic) magnetic susceptibilities in the basal ganglia. R2* mapping proved less sensitive than QSM regarding group differences. The strongest predictor of magnetic susceptibility was age. Susceptibilities were higher with increasing neurologic deficits (r = 0.34, P < .01) and lower with normalized volumes of gray matter (r = -0.35, P < .005) and the cortex (r = -0.35, P < .005). Conclusion QSM provides superior sensitivity over R2* mapping in the detection of MS-related tissue changes in the basal ganglia. With QSM but not with R2* mapping, changes were already observed in patients with clinically isolated syndrome, which suggests that QSM can serve as a sensitive measure at the earliest stage of the disease. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "Purpose To determine the concordance and accuracy of imaging surrogates of immunohistochemical (IHC) markers and the molecular classification of breast cancer. Materials and Methods A total of 3050 patients from 17 public breast cancer data sets containing IHC marker receptor status (estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]) and their molecular classification (basal-like, HER2-enriched, luminal A or B) were analyzed. Diagnostic accuracy and concordance as measured with the \u03ba statistic were calculated between the IHC and molecular classifications. Simulations were performed to assess the relationship between accuracy of imaging-based IHC markers to predict molecular classification. A simulation was performed to examine effects of misclassification of molecular type on patient survival. Results Accuracies of intrinsic subtypes based on IHC subtype were 71.7% (luminal A), 53.7% (luminal B), 64.8% (HER2-enriched), and 81.7% (basal-like). The \u03ba agreement was fair (\u03ba = 0.36) for luminal A and HER2-enriched subtypes, good (\u03ba = 0.65) for the basal-like subtype, and poor (\u03ba = 0.09) for the luminal B subtypes. Introduction of image misclassification by simulation lowered image-true subtype accuracies and \u03ba values. Simulation analysis showed that misclassification caused survival differences between luminal A and basal-like subtypes to decrease. Conclusion There is poor concordance between triple-receptor status and intrinsic molecular subtype in breast cancer, arguing against their use in the design of prognostic genomic-based image biomarkers. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To retrospectively determine the relationship between apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) obtained with 3.0-T diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and Gleason grades in peripheral zone prostate cancer.The requirement to obtain institutional review board approval was waived. Fifty-one patients with prostate cancer underwent MR imaging before prostatectomy, including DW MR imaging with b values of 0, 50, 500, and 800 sec/mm(2). In prostatectomy specimens, separate slice-by-slice determinations of Gleason grade groups were performed according to primary, secondary, and tertiary Gleason grades. In addition, tumors were classified into qualitative grade groups (low-, intermediate-, or high-grade tumors). ADC maps were aligned to step-sections and regions of interest annotated for each tumor slice. The median ADC of tumors was related to qualitative grade groups with linear mixed-model regression analysis. The accuracy of the median ADC in the most aggressive tumor component in the differentiation of low- from combined intermediate- and high-grade tumors was summarized by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (A(z)).In 51 prostatectomy specimens, 62 different tumors and 251 step-section tumor lesions were identified. The median ADC in the tumors showed a negative relationship with Gleason grade group, and differences among the three qualitative grade groups were statistically significant (P < .001). Overall, with an increase of one qualitative grade group, the median ADC (\u00b1standard deviation) decreased 0.18 \u00d7 10(-3) mm(2)/sec \u00b1 0.02. Low-, intermediate-, and high-grade tumors had a median ADC of 1.30 \u00d7 10(-3) mm(2)/sec \u00b1 0.30, 1.07 \u00d7 10(-3) mm(2)/sec \u00b1 0.30, and 0.94 \u00d7 10(-3) mm(2)/sec \u00b1 0.30, respectively. ROC analysis showed a discriminatory performance of A(z) = 0.90 in discerning low-grade from combined intermediate- and high-grade lesions.ADCs at 3.0 T showed an inverse relationship to Gleason grades in peripheral zone prostate cancer. A high discriminatory performance was achieved in the differentiation of low-, intermediate-, and high-grade cancer.",
        "Background An extensive intraductal component (EIC) in breast cancer is an independent risk factor for local recurrence after surgery, especially in young, premenopausal women. Few studies have analyzed long-term outcomes or imaging features of EIC-positive breast cancer. Purpose To assess the prognostic value of EIC on recurrence-free and overall survival in breast cancer and evaluate imaging features of EIC-positive breast cancer by using mammography, US, and MRI. Materials and Methods A retrospective study of 6816 consecutive women with surgically diagnosed invasive breast cancer between January 2007 and December 2012 was performed. After individual matching, women were allocated into either an EIC-positive or an EIC-negative group. Imaging factors associated with prognosis were investigated. The recurrence-free and overall survival rates were compared. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to analyze the effect of EIC. Results Among 6136 included women (mean age, 48.9 years \u00b1 9.8), 1800 EIC-positive and 4336 EIC-negative breast cancers were identified. After matching according to EIC presence was performed, 1551 women were allocated into each group. The mean follow-up period was 79.9 months. The local-regional recurrence rate in the EIC-positive group was higher than that in the EIC-negative group (39.4% [63 of 160] vs 25.5% [37 of 145];",
        "History A 64-year-old man presented with a 6-month history of lightheadedness, intermittent balance, and coordination difficulties. Two months before admission, symptoms became more substantial and persistent, with a worsening sense of disequilibrium and unsteady gait. He reported difficulties pronouncing words and mild word-finding difficulties. His wife noted a change in his cognition and memory over the same time. His medical history included well-controlled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) secondary to a long history of smoking with associated unintentional 30-lb (13.6-kg) weight loss over the previous 3 years, for which chest CT scanning was performed, revealing no abnormality. On clinical examination, the patient was alert and oriented but had slurred speech. A positive Romberg sign was noted, finger-to-nose and hand rapid alternating movement tests revealed impairment on the right side, and his gait was ataxic. The motor examination revealed normal muscle tone, bulk, and power in the upper and lower extremities. Sensory testing results were normal. Initial MRI of the brain at admission revealed abnormal findings in the left supratentorial brain (Figs 1\u20133). Of note, this patient's presentation predated the COVID-19 pandemic. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed predominant pleocytosis (23 \u00d7 106/L; normal range, [0\u20135] \u00d7 106/L) (78% lymphocytes, 22% monocytes), elevated protein level (1.23 g/L; normal range, 0.19\u20130.64 g/L), oligoclonal bands (faint one or two), and a high immunoglobulin G index (0.130 g/L; normal reference, \u22640.059 g/L). Despite extensive initial work-up for inflammatory, infectious, autoimmune, or neoplastic causes, a definitive diagnosis was not reached. Thus, repeat MRI of the brain was performed 2 weeks after admission (Fig 4).",
        "Background Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) has improved the accuracy of mammography, including resolving many breast asymmetries as overlapping breast tissue. The pathologic outcomes of persistent developing asymmetries visualized at DBT are not well established. Purpose To characterize the outcomes and the predictors of malignancy for developing asymmetries visualized at DBT without a sonographic correlate. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included all tomosynthesis-guided biopsies of developing asymmetries performed at a single institution from May 2017 through January 2020. A reader study including three breast imaging radiologists determined interrater agreement and inclusion into the study. Electronic medical records were used to extract patient characteristics, imaging characteristics, and pathologic diagnoses. The Wilcoxon rank sum test, Fisher exact test, and \u03c72 test were used to analyze correlations of patient and imaging characteristics with likelihood of malignancy. Results The reader study included 95 DBT examinations with moderate interrater reliability (Fleiss \u03ba = 0.45). There was majority reader agreement in 85 of the 95 DBT examinations (89%) of 83 women (median age, 56 years; interquartile range, 47-69 years), and this finalized the study data set. At pathologic examination, most asymmetries (68 of 85, 80%) were benign, with common diagnoses being fibrocystic change (n = 20), stromal fibrosis (n = 10), and fat necrosis (n = 10). The overall malignancy rate was 20% (17 of 85 asymmetries; 95% CI: 12, 29); 15 of the 17 malignancies (88%) were invasive cancers. Malignancies were more common in women with a personal history of breast cancer (35% vs 10%, P = .02). Conclusion In 85 developing asymmetries visualized at digital breast tomosynthesis without a sonographic correlate, there was a 20% (95% CI: 12, 29) malignancy rate, which was higher than the rates of malignancy for a developing asymmetry detected at digital mammography. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 See also the editorial by Skaane in this issue.",
        "To determine whether high-dose irreversible electroporation (IRE) ablation induces thermal effects in normal liver tissue.Animal care and use committee approval was obtained prior to the experiments. IRE ablation (n = 78) was performed by a single four-person team in vivo in 22 porcine livers by applying electric current to two 1.3-cm-diameter circular flat-plate electrodes spaced 1 cm apart. Cardiac-gated IRE pulses (n = 40-360) were systematically applied at varying voltages (1500-2900 V). End temperatures at the ablation zone center were measured and were correlated with ablation time, energy parameters, and resultant treatment effect as determined at gross pathologic and histopathologic examination. Temperatures were then monitored at the center and periphery of four ablations created by using a four-electrode IRE array (3000 V, 90 pulses per electrode pair). Data were analyzed by using multivariate analysis of variance with multiple comparisons and/or paired t tests and regression analysis, as appropriate.Temperature rose above the 34\u00b0C baseline after IRE in all flat-plate experiments and correlated linearly (R(2) = 0.39) with IRE \"energy dose\" (product of voltage and number of pulses) and more tightly in univariate analysis with both voltage and number of pulses. Thus, mean temperatures as high as 86\u00b0C \u00b1 3 (standard deviation) were seen for 2500 V and 270 pulses. Ablations of 90 pulses or more at 2500 V produced temperatures of 50\u00b0C or greater and classic gross and histopathologic findings of thermal coagulation (pyknotic nuclei and streaming cytoplasm). For lower IRE doses (ie, 2100 V, 90 pulses), temperatures remained below 45\u00b0C, and only IRE-associated pathologic findings (ie, swollen sinusoids, dehydrated cells, and hemorrhagic infiltrate) were seen. For the four-electrode arrays, temperatures measured 54.2\u00b0C \u00b1 6.1 at the electrode surfaces and 38.6\u00b0C \u00b1 3.2 at the ablation zone margin.In some conditions of high intensity, IRE can produce sufficient heating to induce \"white zone\" thermal coagulation. While this can be useful in some settings to increase tumor destruction, further characterization of the thermal profile created with clinical electrodes and energy parameters is therefore needed to better understand the best ways to avoid unintended damage when ablating near thermally sensitive critical structures.",
        "To investigate the imaging features of hypovascular hypointense nodules on hepatobiliary phase gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) images in patients with cirrhosis that may be associated with progression to hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).The institutional review board approved this retrospective study and waived informed patient consent. This study included 135 patients with a diagnosis of hepatitis B-induced liver cirrhosis and 214 hypovascular hypointense nodules on hepatobiliary phase gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR images. MR images were analyzed with respect to nodule size, degree of hypointensity at hepatobiliary phase (four grades), presence of fat, and signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted (DW) images. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to identify variables that are associated with developing hypervascular HCC.On follow-up MR images, 139 nodules (65.0%) had no evidence of HCC (mean follow-up, 522 days) (group 1), but 75 (35.0%) became hypervascular HCC (mean follow-up, 388 days) (group 2). Univariable Cox analysis revealed that the degree of hypointensity on hepatobiliary phase images (P=.044 and .001) and hyperintensity on T2-weighted and DW images (P=.001 and .0001) was significantly related to the development of hypervascular HCC. According to the multivariable Cox analysis, no other variable significantly adjusted the model once hyperintensity at initial DW imaging was already included as an associated variable, (hazard ratio, 7.44; 95% confidence interval: 4.28, 12.94; P=.0001).Hyperintensity on DW images in hypovascular hypointense nodules on hepatobiliary phase gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR images in patients with cirrhosis is strongly associated with progression to hypervascular HCC.",
        "To explore any correlation between the number of previous gadolinium-based contrast material administrations and high signal intensity (SI) in the dentate nucleus and globus pallidus on unenhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images.The institutional review board approved this study, waiving the requirement to obtain written informed consent. A group of 381 consecutive patients who had undergone brain MR imaging was identified for cross-sectional analysis. For longitudinal analysis, 19 patients who had undergone at least six contrast-enhanced examinations were compared with 16 patients who had undergone at least six unenhanced examinations. The mean SIs of the dentate nucleus, pons, globus pallidus, and thalamus were measured on unenhanced T1-weighted images. The dentate nucleus-to-pons SI ratio was calculated by dividing the SI in the dentate nucleus by that in the pons, and the globus pallidus-to-thalamus SI ratio was calculated by dividing the SI in the globus pallidus by that in the thalamus. Stepwise regression analysis was undertaken in the consecutive patient group to detect any relationship between the dentate nucleus-to-pons or globus pallidus-to-thalamus SI ratio and previous gadolinium-based contrast material administration or other factors. A random coefficient model was used to evaluate for longitudinal analysis.The dentate nucleus-to-pons SI ratio showed a significant correlation with the number of previous gadolinium-based contrast material administrations (P < .001; regression coefficient, 0.010; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.009, 0.011; standardized regression coefficient, 0.695). The globus pallidus-to-thalamus SI ratio showed a significant correlation with the number of previous gadolinium-based contrast material administrations (P < .001; regression coefficient, 0.004; 95% CI: 0.002, 0.006; standardized regression coefficient, 0.288), radiation therapy (P = .009; regression coefficient, -0.014; 95% CI: -0.025, -0.004; standardized regression coefficient, -0.151), and liver function (P = .031; regression coefficient, 0.023; 95% CI: 0.002, 0.044; standardized regression coefficient, 0.107). The dentate nucleus-to-pons and globus pallidus-to-thalamus SI ratios in patients who had undergone contrast-enhanced examinations were significantly greater than those of patients who had undergone unenhanced examinations (P < .001 for both).High SI in the dentate nucleus and globus pallidus on unenhanced T1-weighted images may be a consequence of the number of previous gadolinium-based contrast material administrations.",
        "To evaluate the feasibility of using an internally cooled directional electrode (ICDE) to create sufficient directional ablation in the desired area and to investigate whether use of the ICDE reduces thermal injury to the adjacent organs.The animal care and use committee approved this animal study. In ex vivo studies of bovine livers and colons, temperature was measured in both ablation and nonablation directions with the ICDE, temperature at the liver-colon interface and the presence of burns on the colon were evaluated with each ICDE and internally cooled conventional electrode (ICCE), and the ablation area with the use of three ICDEs in the switching multichannel mode was evaluated. In an in vivo study of 10 pigs, 11 ablations were performed by using three ICDEs in the switching multichannel mode. In addition, the difference in thermal injury to the gallbladder and stomach was compared between use of the ICDE and the ICCE. Mann-Whitney test and the Fisher exact test were used for statistical analysis.In the ex vivo study, the hepatic temperature in the nonablation direction was lower than 50\u00b0C; temperature higher than 47\u00b0C was maintained for less than 3 minutes, even 0.5 cm away from the ICDE; and the temperature at the liver-colon interface did not increase above 50\u00b0C. In the switching multichannel mode, a fused coagulation zone was created. In the in vivo study, confluent ablation was created in the inner circle of three ICDEs with a mean interelectrode distance of less than 2.6 cm. Use of the ICDE did not create a moderate-to-severe gallbladder wall injury in any of the pigs, but use of the ICCE caused injury in three of the five pigs (P > .05). The ICDE caused moderate-to-severe gastric wall injury at one of eight ablations, and the ICCE caused injury at eight of nine ablations (P < .05).Use of an ICDE can create a sufficient ablation in the desired direction and can decrease thermal injury to the adjacent organs.",
        "Purpose To evaluate the efficacy of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) for detecting tuberculosis (TB) on chest radiographs. Materials and Methods Four deidentified HIPAA-compliant datasets were used in this study that were exempted from review by the institutional review board, which consisted of 1007 posteroanterior chest radiographs. The datasets were split into training (68.0%), validation (17.1%), and test (14.9%). Two different DCNNs, AlexNet and GoogLeNet, were used to classify the images as having manifestations of pulmonary TB or as healthy. Both untrained and pretrained networks on ImageNet were used, and augmentation with multiple preprocessing techniques. Ensembles were performed on the best-performing algorithms. For cases where the classifiers were in disagreement, an independent board-certified cardiothoracic radiologist blindly interpreted the images to evaluate a potential radiologist-augmented workflow. Receiver operating characteristic curves and areas under the curve (AUCs) were used to assess model performance by using the DeLong method for statistical comparison of receiver operating characteristic curves. Results The best-performing classifier had an AUC of 0.99, which was an ensemble of the AlexNet and GoogLeNet DCNNs. The AUCs of the pretrained models were greater than that of the untrained models (P < .001). Augmenting the dataset further increased accuracy (P values for AlexNet and GoogLeNet were .03 and .02, respectively). The DCNNs had disagreement in 13 of the 150 test cases, which were blindly reviewed by a cardiothoracic radiologist, who correctly interpreted all 13 cases (100%). This radiologist-augmented approach resulted in a sensitivity of 97.3% and specificity 100%. Conclusion Deep learning with DCNNs can accurately classify TB at chest radiography with an AUC of 0.99. A radiologist-augmented approach for cases where there was disagreement among the classifiers further improved accuracy. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017.",
        "To retrospectively investigate the value of computerized three-dimensional texture analysis for differentiation of preinvasive lesions from invasive pulmonary adenocarcinomas (IPAs) that manifest as part-solid ground-glass nodules (GGNs).The institutional review board approved this retrospective study with a waiver of patients' informed consent. The study consisted of 86 patients with 86 pathologic analysis-confirmed part-solid GGNs (mean size, 16 mm \u00b1 5.4 [standard deviation]) who had undergone computed tomographic (CT) imaging between January 2005 and October 2011. Each part-solid GGN was manually segmented and its computerized texture features were quantitatively extracted by using an in-house software program. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the differentiating factors of preinvasive lesions from IPAs. Three-layered artificial neural networks (ANNs) with a back-propagation algorithm and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were used to build a discriminating model with texture features and to evaluate its discriminating performance.Pathologic analysis confirmed 58 IPAs (seven minimally invasive adenocarcinomas and 51 invasive adenocarcinomas) and 28 preinvasive lesions (four atypical adenomatous hyperplasias and 24 adenocarcinomas in situ). IPAs and preinvasive lesions exhibited significant differences in various histograms and volumetric parameters (P < .05). Multivariate analysis revealed that smaller mass (adjusted odds ratio, 0.092) and higher kurtosis (adjusted odds ratio, 3.319) are significant differentiators of preinvasive lesions from IPAs (P < .05). With mean attenuation, standard deviation of attenuation, mass, kurtosis, and entropy, the ANNs model showed excellent accuracy in differentiation of preinvasive lesions from IPAs (area under the curve, 0.981).In part-solid GGNs, higher kurtosis and smaller mass are significant differentiators of preinvasive lesions from IPAs, and preinvasive lesions can be accurately differentiated from IPAs by using computerized texture analysis.

        "Background Gallium 68 (68Ga)\u2013labeled fibroblast-activation protein inhibitor (FAPI) has recently been introduced as a promising tumor imaging agent. Purpose To compare 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT with fluorine 18 (18F)\u2013labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT in evaluating lung cancer. Materials and Methods In this prospective study conducted from September 2020 to February 2021, images from participants with lung cancer who underwent both 68Ga-FAPI and 18F-FDG PET/CT examinations were analyzed. The tracer uptakes, quantified by maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and target-to-background ratio (TBR), were compared for paired positive lesions between both modalities using the paired t test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results Thirty-four participants (median age, 64 years [interquartile range: 46\u201380 years]; 20 men) were evaluated. From visual evaluation, 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT showed similar performance in the delineation of primary tumors and detection of suspected metastases in the lungs, liver, and adrenal glands. The metabolic tumor volume in primary and recurrent lung tumors showed no difference between modalities (mean: 11.6 vs 10.8, respectively; P = .68). However, compared with 18F-FDG PET/CT, 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT depicted more suspected metastases in lymph nodes (356 vs 320), brain (23 vs 10), bone (109 vs 91), and pleura (66 vs 35). From semiquantitative evaluation, the SUVmax and TBR of primary or recurrent tumors, positive lymph nodes, bone lesions, and pleural lesions at 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT were all higher than those at 18F-FDG PET/CT (all P < .01). Although SUVmax of 68Ga-FAPI and 18F-FDG in brain metastases were not different (mean SUVmax: 9.0 vs 7.4, P = .32), TBR was higher with 68Ga-FAPI than with 18F-FDG (mean: 314.4 vs 1.0, P = .02). Conclusion Gallium 68\u2013labeled fibroblast-activation protein inhibitor PET/CT may outperform fluorine 18\u2013labeled fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT in staging lung cancer, particularly in the detection of metastasis to the brain, lymph nodes, bone, and pleura. \u00a9 RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Background Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) may be cured with radiation therapy. Tumor proximity to critical structures demands accuracy in tumor delineation to avoid toxicities from radiation therapy; however, tumor target contouring for head and neck radiation therapy is labor intensive and highly variable among radiation oncologists. Purpose To construct and validate an artificial intelligence (AI) contouring tool to automate primary gross tumor volume (GTV) contouring in patients with NPC. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, MRI data sets covering the nasopharynx from 1021 patients (median age, 47 years; 751 male, 270 female) with NPC between September 2016 and September 2017 were collected and divided into training, validation, and testing cohorts of 715, 103, and 203 patients, respectively. GTV contours were delineated for 1021 patients and were defined by consensus of two experts. A three-dimensional convolutional neural network was applied to 818 training and validation MRI data sets to construct the AI tool, which was tested in 203 independent MRI data sets. Next, the AI tool was compared against eight qualified radiation oncologists in a multicenter evaluation by using a random sample of 20 test MRI examinations. The Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test was used to compare the difference of Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of pre- versus post-AI assistance. Results The AI-generated contours demonstrated a high level of accuracy when compared with ground truth contours at testing in 203 patients (DSC, 0.79; 2.0-mm difference in average surface distance). In multicenter evaluation, AI assistance improved contouring accuracy (five of eight oncologists had a higher median DSC after AI assistance; average median DSC, 0.74 vs 0.78; P < .001), reduced intra- and interobserver variation (by 36.4% and 54.5%, respectively), and reduced contouring time (by 39.4%). Conclusion The AI contouring tool improved primary gross tumor contouring accuracy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, which could have a positive impact on tumor control and patient survival. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of computed tomography (CT)-guided radiofrequency (RF) neurolysis (RFN) in the management of refractory inguinal neuralgia.Local institutional review board approval was obtained and written informed consent was waived. Twelve patients 26-75 years of age with chronic (>6 months) inguinal pain refractory to specific medication were included between 2005 and 2011. Data on patient demographics, clinical history, and pain management history were retrospectively assessed. Pain was measured on a visual analog scale (VAS) from 0 to 10 before and immediately after the procedure and at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Diagnosis was always confirmed by a positive nerve block test result. Ambulatory CT-guided RF was the rule.Sixteen RFN procedures were performed. Pain was present for an average of 3.2 years (range: 2-8 years) prior to initial RFN. Mean VAS score before the procedure was 7.75 of 10. Immediate pain relief of 100% was achieved in all patients. Pain reduction at 1-, 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-up was statistically significant. Important pain reduction (\u226580%) was obtained in 75% of RFN procedures at 6-month follow-up and in 50% of cases at 12 months. The mean duration of pain relief was 11.8 months after RFN, with a maximum average pain reduction of 84.5%. No complications were noted during or after the procedure.RFN with CT guidance is an effective technique in the management of refractory inguinal pain with lasting satisfactory pain reduction; it may be considered as an alternative treatment to surgery. These results should be confirmed in a controlled trial with a larger series of patients.",
        "Background Intratumor heterogeneity in lung cancer may influence outcomes. CT radiomics seeks to assess tumor features to provide detailed imaging features. However, CT radiomic features vary according to the reconstruction kernel used for image generation. Purpose To investigate the effect of different reconstruction kernels on radiomic features and assess whether image conversion using a convolutional neural network (CNN) could improve reproducibility of radiomic features between different kernels. Materials and Methods In this retrospective analysis, patients underwent non\u2013contrast material\u2013enhanced and contrast material\u2013enhanced axial chest CT with soft kernel (B30f) and sharp kernel (B50f) reconstruction using a single CT scanner from April to June 2017. To convert different kernels without sinogram, the CNN model was developed using residual learning and an end-to-end way. Kernel-converted images were generated, from B30f to B50f and from B50f to B30f. Pulmonary nodules or masses were semiautomatically segmented and 702 radiomic features (tumor intensity, texture, and wavelet features) were extracted. Measurement variability in radiomic features was evaluated using the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). Results A total of 104 patients were studied, including 54 women and 50 men, with pulmonary nodules or masses (mean age, 63.2 years \u00b1 10.5). The CCC between two readers using the same kernel was 0.92, and 592 of 702 (84.3%) of the radiomic features were reproducible (CCC \u2265 0.85); using different kernels, the CCC was 0.38 and only 107 of 702 (15.2%) of the radiomic features were reliable. Texture features and wavelet features were predominantly affected by reconstruction kernel (CCC, from 0.88 to 0.61 for texture features and from 0.92 to 0.35 for wavelet features). After applying image conversion, CCC improved to 0.84 and 403 of 702 (57.4%) radiomic features were reproducible (CCC, 0.85 for texture features and 0.84 for wavelet features). Conclusion Chest CT image conversion using a convolutional neural network effectively reduced the effect of two different reconstruction kernels and may improve the reproducibility of radiomic features in pulmonary nodules or masses. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "History A 26-year-old man presented with a 1-month history of chest pain, a palpable and painful right inguinal mass, and edema in the right lower extremity. One month earlier, he started to experience left chest pain with no cough. Pulmonary CT angiography (CTA) revealed a left lower lobe segmental pulmonary embolus. The local hospital made a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. He received anticoagulants, and his chest pain was gradually relieved. At the time of current presentation, the patient was experiencing right lower extremity swelling and pain. Physical examination revealed a 4 \u00d7 3 cm palpable right inguinal mass with no redness. His medical history and family history were negative. The results of laboratory work-up were normal, with a d-dimer level of 0.16 mg/L fibrinogen equivalent units (reference range, <0.46 mg/L) and an international normalized ratio of 2.45 (therapeutic range, 2.0\u20133.0 for a patient taking warfarin), except the prothrombin time was 28.2 seconds (reference range, 9.6\u201312.8 seconds) and the activated partial thromboplastin time was 52.2 seconds (reference range, 24.8\u201333.8 seconds). Echocardiography, chest radiography, chest CT, and contrast-enhanced (CE) CT revealed no abnormalities. The patient underwent right lower extremity vascular conventional US (Philips IU22; Philips) with an L9\u20133 probe (3\u20139 MHz, venous condition) and contrast-enhanced US (1.5\u20132.0 mL, SonoVue; Bracco) with an intravenous bolus injection at the initial evaluation.

        "Background Deep learning (DL) algorithms could improve the classification of ovarian tumors assessed with multimodal US. Purpose To develop DL algorithms for the automated classification of benign versus malignant ovarian tumors assessed with US and to compare algorithm performance to Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System (O-RADS) and subjective expert assessment for malignancy. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included consecutive women with ovarian tumors undergoing gray scale and color Doppler US from January 2019 to November 2019. Histopathologic analysis was the reference standard. The data set was divided into training (70%), validation (10%), and test (20%) sets. Algorithms modified from residual network (ResNet) with two fusion strategies (feature fusion [hereafter, DLfeature] or decision fusion [hereafter, DLdecision]) were developed. DL prediction of malignancy was compared with O-RADS risk categorization and expert assessment by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis in the test set. Results A total of 422 women (mean age, 46.4 years \u00b1 14.8 [SD]) with 304 benign and 118 malignant tumors were included; there were 337 women in the training and validation data set and 85 women in the test data set. DLfeature had an AUC of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.97) for classifying malignant from benign ovarian tumors, comparable with O-RADS (AUC, 0.92; 95% CI: 0.85, 0.97; P = .88) and expert assessment (AUC, 0.97; 95% CI: 0.91, 0.99; P = .07), and similar to DLdecision (AUC, 0.90; 95% CI: 0.82, 0.96; P = .29). DLdecision, DLfeature, O-RADS, and expert assessment achieved sensitivities of 92%, 92%, 92%, and 96%, respectively, and specificities of 80%, 85%, 89%, and 87%, respectively, for malignancy. Conclusion Deep learning algorithms developed by using multimodal US images may distinguish malignant from benign ovarian tumors with diagnostic performance comparable to expert subjective and Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System assessment. \u00a9 RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",

There was no relevant surgical or family history. The general physical examination findings were unremarkable, with a normal abdomen at both visual inspection and palpation; urogenital examination revealed a small left-sided palpable mass of the testis, compatible with an inguinal hernia or hydrocele. At first, gray-scale and color Doppler ultrasonographic (US) images of the testes and the inguinoscrotal region were obtained. Contrast material-enhanced computed tomographic (CT) images of the lower abdomen and pelvis were then obtained to further evaluate the urinary tract.",
        "Background Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is an established method used to detect and localize focal interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs). Current MEG systems house hundreds of cryogenic sensors in a rigid, one-size-fits-all helmet, which results in several limitations, particularly in children. Purpose To determine if on-scalp MEG based on optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) alleviates the main limitations of cryogenic MEG. Materials and Methods In this prospective single-center study conducted in a tertiary university teaching hospital, participants underwent cryogenic (102 magnetometers, 204 planar gradiometers) and on-scalp (32 OPMs) MEG. The two modalities for the detection and localization of IEDs were compared. The t test was used to compare IED amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Distributed source modeling was performed on OPM-based and cryogenic MEG data. Results Five children (median age, 9.4 years [range, 5\u201311 years]; four girls) with self-limited idiopathic (n = 3) or refractory (n = 2) focal epilepsy were included. IEDs were identified in all five children with comparable sensor topographies for both MEG devices. IED amplitudes were 2.3 (7.2 of 3.1) to 4.6 (3.2 of 0.7) times higher (P < .001) with on-scalp MEG, and the SNR was 27% (16.7 of 13.2) to 60% (12.8 of 8.0) higher (P value range: .001\u2013.009) with on-scalp MEG in all but one participant (P = .93), whose head movements created pronounced motion artifacts. The neural source of averaged IEDs was located at approximately 5 mm (n = 3) or higher (8.3 mm, n = 1; 15.6 mm, n = 1) between on-scalp and cryogenic MEG. Conclusion Despite the limited number of sensors and scalp coverage, on-scalp magnetoencephalography (MEG) based on optically pumped magnetometers helped detect interictal epileptiform discharges in school-aged children with epilepsy with a higher amplitude, higher signal-to-noise ratio, and similar localization value compared with conventional cryogenic MEG.

        "History A 17-year-old white male adolescent was re-evaluated for a withheld cardiac condition initially detected during prenatal imaging at an outside institution. He had previously experienced intermittent episodes of shortness of breath, chest pain, and palpitations with exertion, but more recently he had been asymptomatic. He had no other comorbidities and no family history of congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, or sudden cardiac death. At physical examination, the patient had a grade II/IV rumbling systolic murmur best heard at the left upper sternal border. Otherwise, cardiovascular and other physical examination findings were normal. An electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia and nonspecific T wave changes. A graded exercise stress test was normal. Cardiac MRI was performed without and with gadolinium-based contrast material ( Figs 1 - 3 ). Multiple echocardiograms obtained since birth, cardiac MR images obtained 2 and 4 years earlier ( Fig 4 ), and nongated CT images obtained with iodinated contrast material to evaluate trauma 8 years prior ( Fig 5 ) showed findings similar to those of the current examination. Prior chest radiographs (not shown) were normal, and angiography performed when the patient was 4 years old revealed normal coronary arteries.

        "Purpose To estimate the prevalence of incidental thyroid cancer (ITC) among patients undergoing thyroid surgery and to apply the Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound (SRU) guidelines to ITC. Materials and Methods This HIPAA-compliant study was approved by the institutional review board, with waiver of the need to obtain informed consent. A retrospective review of data in patients who underwent thyroid surgery between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2012, was performed. Imaging studies and reports were reviewed for ITCs that were first detected at either ultrasonography (US) or a different imaging modality and that included US as part of the work-up. ITCs were categorized by using the SRU guidelines to determine the characteristics of SRU criteria\u2013positive and SRU criteria\u2013negative malignancies. Patient demographic data, tumor histologic findings, tumor size, and tumor stage were compared for the SRU criteria\u2013positive and SRU criteria\u2013negative cancers by using the unpaired t test and the \u03c72 test. Results Among 2090 patients who underwent thyroid surgery, 680 had thyroid cancer; of these patients, 101 (15%) had imaging-detected ITC. The SRU recommendations were applied to the findings in 90 of the 101 patients who had undergone US with images or had reports available for review. Sixteen (18%) of the 90 patients had SRU criteria\u2013negative tumors, which represented 2% (16 of 680) of all thyroid cancers. SRU criteria\u2013negative tumors were smaller than SRU criteria\u2013positive tumors (mean, 1.1 cm [range, 0.9\u20131.4 cm] vs mean, 2.5 cm [range, 1.0\u20137.6 cm]; P < .001) and were more likely to be stage I (15 [94%] of 16 vs 47 [64%] of 74; P = .02). Conclusion Imaging-detected ITCs are uncommon. Two percent (16 of 680) of malignancies would not undergo fine-needle aspiration biopsy or surgery if the SRU guidelines were used for work-up of incidental thyroid nodules. SRU criteria\u2013negative tumors are lower in stage than SRU criteria\u2013positive tumors. \u00a9 RSNA, 2014",
        "Purpose To create a radiogenomic map linking computed tomographic (CT) image features and gene expression profiles generated by RNA sequencing for patients with non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Materials and Methods A cohort of 113 patients with NSCLC diagnosed between April 2008 and September 2014 who had preoperative CT data and tumor tissue available was studied. For each tumor, a thoracic radiologist recorded 87 semantic image features, selected to reflect radiologic characteristics of nodule shape, margin, texture, tumor environment, and overall lung characteristics. Next, total RNA was extracted from the tissue and analyzed with RNA sequencing technology. Ten highly coexpressed gene clusters, termed metagenes, were identified, validated in publicly available gene-expression cohorts, and correlated with prognosis. Next, a radiogenomics map was built that linked semantic image features to metagenes by using the t statistic and the Spearman correlation metric with multiple testing correction. Results RNA sequencing analysis resulted in 10 metagenes that capture a variety of molecular pathways, including the epidermal growth factor (EGF) pathway. A radiogenomic map was created with 32 statistically significant correlations between semantic image features and metagenes. For example, nodule attenuation and margins are associated with the late cell-cycle genes, and a metagene that represents the EGF pathway was significantly correlated with the presence of ground-glass opacity and irregular nodules or nodules with poorly defined margins. Conclusion Radiogenomic analysis of NSCLC showed multiple associations between semantic image features and metagenes that represented canonical molecular pathways, and it can result in noninvasive identification of molecular properties of NSCLC.

        "Background The prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with major portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) is dismal after standard treatment with sorafenib. Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) has been suggested for patients with HCC and major PVTT. Purpose To compare the efficacy and safety of sorafenib plus 3cir-OFF HAIC versus sorafenib alone for advanced HCC with major PVTT. Materials and Methods This phase II trial recruited systemic treatment-na\u00efve patients with HCC and major PVTT (portal vein invasion grade Vp3 [first branch] and Vp4 [main trunk]) between June 2017 and November 2019. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to receive sorafenib (400 mg twice daily) plus 3cir-OFF HAIC (35 mg/m2 oxaliplatin [hours 0\u20132] followed by 600 mg/m2 5-fluorouracil [hours 2\u201324], days 1\u20133) with a standardized percutaneous port catheter system or sorafenib alone (400 mg twice daily) every 4 weeks. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). The secondary end points were objective response rate, progression-free survival (PFS), and safety. OS and PFS were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Results The intent-to-treat population included 64 patients, with 32 in each group. The median OS was 16.3 months (95% CI: 0.0, 35.5) with sorafenib plus HAIC and 6.5 months (95% CI: 4.4, 8.6) with sorafenib alone (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.28; 95% CI: 0.15, 0.53; P < .001). A higher objective response rate (41% [n = 13] vs 3% [n = 1], P < .001) and a longer median PFS (9.0 months vs 2.5 months; HR = 0.26; 95% CI: 0.15, 0.47; P < .001) were observed in the sorafenib plus HAIC group. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were more frequent in the sorafenib plus HAIC group, including diarrhea (n = 7 [22%] vs n = 5 [16%]), hand-foot syndrome (n = 6 [19%] vs n = 2 [6%]), and thrombocytopenia (n = 7 [22%] vs n = 0). Conclusion Sorafenib plus 3cir-OFF hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy may be a promising treatment in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and major portal vein tumor thrombosis because of the improved survival and an acceptable safety profile.

        "Purpose To analyze the frequency and distribution of low-signal-intensity regions (LSIRs) in lymphoma lesions and to compare these to fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake and biologic markers of inflammation. Materials and Methods The authors analyzed 61 untreated patients with a bulky lymphoma (at least one tumor mass \u22657 cm in diameter). When a LSIR within tumor lesions was detected on diffusion-weighted images obtained with a b value of 50 sec/mm2, a T2-weighted gradient-echo (GRE) sequence was performed and calcifications were searched for with computed tomography (CT). In two patients, Perls staining was performed on tissue samples from the LSIR. LSIRs were compared with biologic inflammatory parameters and baseline FDG positon emission tomography (PET)/CT parameters (maximum standardized uptake value [SUVmax], total metabolic tumor volume [TMTV]). Results LSIRs were detected in 22 patients and corresponded to signal void on GRE images; one LSIR was due to calcifications, and three LSIRS were due to a recent biopsy. In 18 patients, LSIRs appeared to be related to focal iron deposits; this was proven with Perls staining in two patients. The LSIRs presumed to be due to iron deposits were found mostly in patients with aggressive lymphoma (nine of 26 patients with Hodgkin lymphoma and eight of 20 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma vs one of 15 patients with follicular lymphoma; P = .047) and with advanced stage disease (15 of 18 patients). LSIRS were observed in spleen (n = 14), liver (n = 3), and nodal (n = 8) lesions and corresponded to foci FDG uptake, with mean SUVmax of 9.8, 6.7, and 16.2, respectively. These patients had significantly higher serum levels of C-reactive protein, \u03b11-globulin, and \u03b12-globulin and more frequently had microcytic anemia than those without such deposits (P = .0072, P = .003, P = .0068, and P < .0001, respectively). They also had a significantly higher TMTV (P = .0055) and higher levels of spleen involvement (P < .0001). Conclusion LSIRs due to focal iron deposits are detected in lymphoma lesions and are associated with a more pronounced biologic inflammatory syndrome. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To determine the feasibility of using in vivo diffusion-tensor imaging and tractography of the physis to examine changes related to rate of growth, location, and age.This retrospective study was institutional review board approved and HIPAA compliant and the requirement for informed consent was waived. Diffusion-tensor imaging of the knee was performed at 3.0 T in 31 subjects (nine boys and 22 girls) with a median age of 13.6 years. The mean ages of boys and girls were 14.7 years (range, 12.0-18.3 years) and 13.2 years (range, 7.0-18.6 years), respectively. Regions of interest were placed in the physis of the tibia and femur, and in the epiphyseal and articular cartilage of these bones. Tractography was performed by using a fractional anisotropic threshold of 0.15 and an angle threshold of 40\u00b0. The tractographic patterns were qualitatively evaluated and changes related to age were described. The tract-based apparent diffusion coefficient, fractional anistropy, tensor eigenvalues, and tract length were measured. Diffusion parameters were compared between the center and periphery of the physis, and between the distal femur and proximal tibia.Tractography resulted in parallel tracts in the physis and the adjacent metaphysis. Tractographic pattern changed with age, with individuals approaching physeal closure having shorter tracts in a random arrangement. Patterns of tractography varied with age in the femur (P < .001) and tibia (P < .001). Femoral tracts (median length, 6.5 mm) were longer than tibial tracts (median length, 4.3 mm) (P < .001). Tracts in the periphery of the physes were longer than those in the center (femur, P = .005; tibia, P = .004). In the physis of the femur and tibia, a significant age-related decrease was observed in apparent diffusion coefficient (P < .001 for both), axial diffusion (femur, P = .001; tibia, P < .001), and transverse diffusion [P < .001 for both]), and an age-related increase was seen in fractional anistropy (P < .001, for both).Diffusion-tensor imaging shows the columnar microstructure of the physis and adjacent metaphysis, and provides further insight into normal growth.",
        "This case series examines cardiac MRI findings in four children and adolescents admitted to intensive care in April 2020 for multisystem inflammatory syndrome and Kawasaki disease\u2013like features related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

        "Purpose To compare different methods for generating features from radiology reports and to develop a method to automatically identify findings in these reports. Materials and Methods In this study, 96 303 head computed tomography (CT) reports were obtained. The linguistic complexity of these reports was compared with that of alternative corpora. Head CT reports were preprocessed, and machine-analyzable features were constructed by using bag-of-words (BOW), word embedding, and Latent Dirichlet allocation-based approaches. Ultimately, 1004 head CT reports were manually labeled for findings of interest by physicians, and a subset of these were deemed critical findings. Lasso logistic regression was used to train models for physician-assigned labels on 602 of 1004 head CT reports (60%) using the constructed features, and the performance of these models was validated on a held-out 402 of 1004 reports (40%). Models were scored by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and aggregate AUC statistics were reported for (a) all labels, (b) critical labels, and (c) the presence of any critical finding in a report. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and F1 score were reported for the best performing model's (a) predictions of all labels and (b) identification of reports containing critical findings. Results The best-performing model (BOW with unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams plus average word embeddings vector) had a held-out AUC of 0.966 for identifying the presence of any critical head CT finding and an average 0.957 AUC across all head CT findings. Sensitivity and specificity for identifying the presence of any critical finding were 92.59% (175 of 189) and 89.67% (191 of 213), respectively. Average sensitivity and specificity across all findings were 90.25% (1898 of 2103) and 91.72% (18 351 of 20 007), respectively. Simpler BOW methods achieved results competitive with those of more sophisticated approaches, with an average AUC for presence of any critical finding of 0.951 for unigram BOW versus 0.966 for the best-performing model. The Yule I of the head CT corpus was 34, markedly lower than that of the Reuters corpus (at 103) or I2B2 discharge summaries (at 271), indicating lower linguistic complexity. Conclusion Automated methods can be used to identify findings in radiology reports. The success of this approach benefits from the standardized language of these reports. With this method, a large labeled corpus can be generated for applications such as deep learning. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Background Developments in artificial intelligence (AI) systems to assist radiologists in reading mammograms could improve breast cancer screening efficiency. Purpose To investigate whether an AI system could detect normal, moderate-risk, and suspicious mammograms in a screening sample to safely reduce radiologist workload and evaluate across Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) densities. Materials and Methods This retrospective simulation study analyzed mammographic examination data consecutively collected from January 2014 to December 2015 in the Danish Capital Region breast cancer screening program. All mammograms were scored from 0 to 10, representing the risk of malignancy, using an AI tool. During simulation, normal mammograms (score < 5) would be excluded from radiologist reading and suspicious mammograms (score > recall threshold [RT]) would be recalled. Two radiologists read the remaining mammograms. The RT was fitted using another independent cohort (same institution) by matching to the radiologist sensitivity. This protocol was further applied to each BI-RADS density. Screening outcomes were measured using the sensitivity, specificity, workload, and false-positive rate. The AI-based screening was tested for noninferiority sensitivity compared with radiologist screening using the Farrington-Manning test. Specificities were compared using the McNemar test. Results The study sample comprised 114 421 screenings for breast cancer in 114 421 women, resulting in 791 screen-detected, 327 interval, and 1473 long-term cancers and 2107 false-positive screenings. The mean age of the women was 59 years \u00b1 6 (SD). The AI-based screening sensitivity was 69.7% (779 of 1118; 95% CI: 66.9, 72.4) and was noninferior (P = .02) to the radiologist screening sensitivity of 70.8% (791 of 1118; 95% CI: 68.0, 73.5). The AI-based screening specificity was 98.6% (111 725 of 113 303; 95% CI: 98.5, 98.7), which was higher (P < .001) than the radiologist specificity of 98.1% (111 196 of 113 303; 95% CI: 98.1, 98.2). The radiologist workload was reduced by 62.6% (71 585 of 114 421), and 25.1% (529 of 2107) of false-positive screenings were avoided. Screening results were consistent across BI-RADS densities, although not significantly so for sensitivity. Conclusion Artificial intelligence (AI)\u2013based screening could detect normal, moderate-risk, and suspicious mammograms in a breast cancer screening program, which may reduce the radiologist workload. AI-based screening performed consistently across breast densities. \u00a9 RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To evaluate the accuracy of spleen stiffness (SS) and liver stiffness (LS) measured by using acoustic radiation force impulse imaging in the diagnosis of portal hypertension in patients with liver cirrhosis, with the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) as a reference standard.Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained for this prospective single-center study. From February 2012 to August 2013, 60 patients with liver cirrhosis (mean age, 70.8 years; age range, 34-88 years; 34 men, 26 women) with HVPG, LS, and SS measurements and gastrointestinal endoscopy and laboratory data were included if they met the following criteria: no recent episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding, no history of splenectomy, no history of partial splenic embolization, no history of \u03b2-blocker therapy, and absence of portal thrombosis. The efficacy of the parameters for the evaluation of portal hypertension was analyzed by using the Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.The correlation coefficient between SS and HVPG (r = 0.876) was significantly better than that between LS and HVPG (r = 0.609, P < .0001). The areas under the ROC curve of SS for the identification of clinically important portal hypertension (HVPG \u2265 10 mm Hg), severe portal hypertension (HVPG \u2265 12 mm Hg), esophageal varices (EVs), and high-risk EVs were significantly higher (0.943, 0.963, 0.937, and 0.955, respectively) than those of LS, spleen diameter, platelet count, and platelet count to spleen diameter ratio (P < .05 for all). SS could be used to accurately rule out the presence of clinically important portal hypertension, severe portal hypertension, EVs, and high-risk EVs (negative likelihood ratios, 0.051, 0.056, 0.054, and 0.074, respectively).SS is reliable and has better diagnostic performance than LS for identifying portal hypertension in liver cirrhosis.",
        "To estimate the effect of the number of computed tomography (CT) sections on trapped air (TA) assessment in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) by using an established scoring system and a new quantitative scoring system and to compare CT and pulmonary function test (PFT) estimates of TA in a cross-sectional and longitudinal study.In this institutional review board-approved pilot study, 20 subjects aged 6-20 years (12 female and eight male; median age, 12.6 years) contributed two expiratory CT studies (three-section baseline CT, volumetric follow-up CT) and two PFT studies over 2 years after parental informed consent was obtained. From follow-up CT studies, seven sets were composed: Set 1 was volumetric. Sets 2, 3, 4, and 5, had spacing of 2.4, 4.8, 9.6, and 20.4 mm, respectively, between sections. Sets 6 and 7 contained five and three sections, respectively. Longitudinal follow-up was performed with three sections. All images were deidentified and randomized, and TA was scored with the Brody II system and a new quantitative system. Statistical analysis included the Wilcoxon signed rank test, calculation of Spearman and intraclass correlation coefficients, and use of three-section and linear mixed models.For the Brody II system, the intraclass correlation coefficient for set 1 versus those for sets 2 through 7 was 0.75 versus 0.87; however, mean scores from sets 6 and 7 were significantly lower than the mean score from set 1 (P = .01 and P < .001, respectively). For the quantitative system, the number of sections did not affect TA assessment (intraclass correlation coefficient range, 0.82-0.88; P > .13 for all). CT and PFT estimates were not correlated (r(s) = 20.19 to 0.09, P = .43-.93). No change in TA over time was found for CT or PFT (P > .16 for all).The number of sections affected Brody II estimates, suggesting that three-section protocols lead to underestimation of TA assessment in patients with CF when using the Brody II system; CT and PFT estimates of TA showed no correlation and no significant change over time.",
        "To determine the frequency of critical radiology results in 9.3 million radiology reports from our health system, to identify those containing documentation of communication by using automated text-classification algorithms, and to assess the impact of a policy requiring documentation of critical results communication.This HIPAA-compliant retrospective study received institutional review board approval. Text-mining algorithms that were previously validated to have mean accuracies of more than 90% for identifying certain critical results and documentation of communications were applied to a database of 9.3 million radiology reports. The frequency of critical results and documentation of communication were then determined from 1990 to 2011.There was an increase in documentation of communication for all critical results from 1990 to 2011. In 1990, 19.0% of reports with critical values had evidence of documentation of communication compared with 72.4% of reports in 2010. The linear trend for increasing documentation of communications began in 1997 and continued until 2011 (P < .001). From 1990 to 2011, documentation of communication was highest in acute scrotal torsion (70.6%) and ectopic pregnancy (65.4%) and lowest in unexplained free-intraperitoneal air (29.5%) and malpositioned tubes (30.4%). In 2010-2011, radiologists were least likely to document communication of results for malpositioned endotracheal and enteric tubes (2010, 58.56%; 2011, 57.50%) and unexplained free-intraperitoneal air (2010, 59.57%; 2011, 75.51%). They were most likely to document communication of results for ectopic pregnancy (2010, 94.12%; 2011, 93.48%) and acute appendicitis (2010, 86.87%; 2011, 84.31%).There was an increase in documentation of communication of critical results, which demonstrated a rising linear trend that began in 1997 and continued until 2011. The increasing trend began well before policy implementation, indicating that other factors such as heightened awareness among radiologists likely had a role.",
        "Background The Vesical Imaging-Reporting and Data System (VI-RADS) scoring system was created in 2018 to standardize imaging and reporting of bladder cancer staging with multiparametric MRI. The system provides a five-point VI-RADS score, which suggests the likelihood of detrusor muscle invasion. Muscle-invasive disease carries a worse prognosis and requires radical surgery. Purpose To determine the performance of the VI-RADS score in detecting muscle-invasive bladder cancer in a cohort of patients undergoing multiparametric MRI before surgery. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, a total of 340 patients with bladder cancer were identified from a database of consecutive patients undergoing multiparametric MRI from November 2011 to August 2018. The tumor with the largest burden was selected in those patients with multifocal tumors. Bladder tumors were retrospectively categorized according to the VI-RADS five-point scoring system by two readers, independently and in consensus, who were blinded to histologic findings. The VI-RADS score was compared with postoperative pathology for each tumor, and the performance of VI-RADS for determining detrusor muscle invasion was analyzed by using the Cochran-Armitage test. Results Among the 340 patients, there were 296 men and 44 women; the median age was 64.0 years (interquartile range [IQR], 57.0\u201387.0 years). Of 340 tumors, 255 (75.0%) were verified as non\u2013muscle-invasive and 85 (25.0%) as muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Both the VI-RADS score and its components were associated with muscle-invasive condition (P < .001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for VI-RADS for muscle invasion was 0.94 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.90, 0.98). The sensitivity and specificity of a VI-RADS score of 3 or greater were 87.1% (95% CI: 78%, 93%) and 96.5% (95% CI: 93%, 98%), respectively. Conclusion The Vesical Imaging-Reporting and Data System score effectively defines the likelihood of detrusor muscle invasion in bladder cancer and should be considered for evaluation of tumors prior to surgery. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "To validate whether repeated magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-guided focused ultrasound treatments targeted to the hippocampus, a brain structure relevant for Alzheimer disease ( AD Alzheimer disease ), could modulate pathologic abnormalities, plasticity, and behavior in a mouse model.All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Care Committee and are in accordance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Seven-month-old transgenic (TgCRND8) (Tg) mice and their nontransgenic (non-Tg) littermates were entered in the study. Mice were treated weekly with MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound in the bilateral hippocampus (1.68 MHz, 10-msec bursts, 1-Hz burst repetition frequency, 120-second total duration). After 1 month, spatial memory was tested in the Y maze with the novel arm prior to sacrifice and immunohistochemical analysis. The data were compared by using unpaired t tests and analysis of variance with Tukey post hoc analysis.Untreated Tg mice spent 61% less time than untreated non-Tg mice exploring the novel arm of the Y maze because of spatial memory impairments (P < .05). Following MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound, Tg mice spent 99% more time exploring the novel arm, performing as well as their non-Tg littermates. Changes in behavior were correlated with a reduction of the number and size of amyloid plaques in the MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound-treated animals (P < .01). Further, after MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound treatment, there was a 250% increase in the number of newborn neurons in the hippocampus (P < .01). The newborn neurons had longer dendrites and more arborization after MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound, as well (P < .01).Repeated MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound treatments led to spatial memory improvement in a Tg mouse model of AD Alzheimer disease . The behavior changes may be mediated by decreased amyloid pathologic abnormalities and increased neuronal plasticity.",
        "Purpose To assess the accuracy of staging positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in detecting distant metastasis in patients with local-regionally advanced cervical and high-risk endometrial cancer in the clinical trial by the American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) and the Gynecology Oncology Group (GOG) (ACRIN 6671/GOG 0233) and to compare central and institutional reader performance. Materials and Methods In this prospective multicenter trial, PET/CT and clinical data were reviewed for patients enrolled in ACRIN 6671/GOG 0233. Two central readers, blinded to site read and reference standard, reviewed PET/CT images for distant metastasis. Central review was then compared with institutional point-of-care interpretation. Reference standard was pathologic and imaging follow-up. Test performance for central and site reviews of PET/CT images was calculated and receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed. Generalized estimating equations and nonparametric bootstrap procedure for clustered data were used to assess statistical significance. Results There were 153 patients with cervical cancer and 203 patients with endometrial cancer enrolled at 28 sites. Overall prevalence of distant metastasis was 13.7% (21 of 153) for cervical cancer and 11.8% (24 of 203) for endometrial cancer. Central reader PET/CT interpretation demonstrated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value of 54.8%, 97.7%, 79.3%, and 93.1% for cervical cancer metastasis versus 64.6%, 98.6%, 86.1%, and 95.4% for endometrial cancer, respectively. By comparison, local institutional review demonstrated sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and negative predictive value of 47.6%, 93.9%, 55.6%, and 91.9% for cervical cancer metastasis and 66.7%, 93.9%, 59.3%, and 95.5% for endometrial cancer, respectively. For central readers, the specificity and PPV of PET/CT detection of cervical and endometrial cancer metastases were all significantly higher compared with that of local institutional review (P < .05). Central reader area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values were 0.78 and 0.89 for cervical and endometrial cancer, respectively; these were not significantly different from local institutional AUC values (0.75 and 0.84, respectively; P > .05 for both). Conclusion FDG PET/CT demonstrates high specificity and PPV for detecting distant metastasis in cervical and endometrial cancer and should be included in the staging evaluation. Blinded central review of imaging provides improved specificity and PPV for the detection of metastases and should be considered for future oncologic imaging clinical trials. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017",
        "To quantitatively compare the potential of various diffusion parameters obtained from monoexponential, biexponential, and stretched exponential diffusion-weighted imaging models and diffusion kurtosis imaging in the grading of gliomas.This study was approved by the local ethics committee, and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Both diffusion-weighted imaging and diffusion kurtosis imaging were performed in 69 patients with pathologically proven gliomas by using a 3-T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging unit. An isotropic apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), true ADC, pseudo-ADC, and perfusion fraction were calculated from diffusion-weighted images by using a biexponential model. A water molecular diffusion heterogeneity index and distributed diffusion coefficient were calculated from diffusion-weighted images by using a stretched exponential model. Mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy, and mean kurtosis were calculated from diffusion kurtosis images. All values were compared between high-grade and low-grade gliomas by using a Mann-Whitney U test. Receiver operating characteristic and Spearman rank correlation analysis were used for statistical evaluations.ADC, true ADC, perfusion fraction, water molecular diffusion heterogeneity index, distributed diffusion coefficient, and mean diffusivity values were significantly lower in high-grade gliomas than in low-grade gliomas (U = 109, 56, 129, 6, 206, and 229, respectively; P < .05). Pseudo-ADC and mean kurtosis values were significantly higher in high-grade gliomas than in low-grade gliomas (U = 98 and 8, respectively; P < .05). Both water molecular diffusion heterogeneity index (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.993) and mean kurtosis (AUC = 0.991) had significantly greater AUC values than ADC (AUC = 0.866), mean diffusivity (AUC = 0.722), and fractional anisotropy (AUC = 0.500) in the differentiation of low-grade and high-grade gliomas (P < .05).Water molecular diffusion heterogeneity index and mean kurtosis values may provide additional information and improve the grading of gliomas compared with conventional diffusion parameters.",
        "This is a condensed summary of an international multisociety statement on ethics of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology produced by the ACR, European Society of Radiology, RSNA, Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine, European Society of Medical Imaging Informatics, Canadian Association of Radiologists, and American Association of Physicists in Medicine. AI has great potential to increase efficiency and accuracy throughout radiology, but it also carries inherent pitfalls and biases. Widespread use of AI-based intelligent and autonomous systems in radiology can increase the risk of systemic errors with high consequence and highlights complex ethical and societal issues. Currently, there is little experience using AI for patient care in diverse clinical settings. Extensive research is needed to understand how to best deploy AI in clinical practice. This statement highlights our consensus that ethical use of AI in radiology should promote well-being, minimize harm, and ensure that the benefits and harms are distributed among stakeholders in a just manner. We believe AI should respect human rights and freedoms, including dignity and privacy. It should be designed for maximum transparency and dependability. Ultimate responsibility and accountability for AI remains with its human designers and operators for the foreseeable future. The radiology community should start now to develop codes of ethics and practice for AI that promote any use that helps patients and the common good and should block use of radiology data and algorithms for financial gain without those two attributes.

        "To identify patient characteristics and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings associated with subsequent hypervascularization in hypovascular nodules that show hypointensity on hepatobiliary phase gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR images in patients with chronic liver diseases.Institutional review board approval was obtained, and informed consent was waived. At multiple follow-up gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging examinations of 68 patients, 160 hypovascular nodules were retrospectively reviewed. A Cox regression model for hypervascularization was developed to explore the association of baseline characteristics, including patient factors (Child-Pugh classification, etiology of liver disease, history of local therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC], and coexistence of hypervascular HCC) and MR imaging findings (fat content, signal intensity on T2-weighted images, and nodule size). In addition, the growth rate was calculated as the reciprocal of tumor volume doubling time to investigate its relationship with subsequent hypervascularization by using receiver operating characteristic and Kaplan-Meier analyses.The prevalence of subsequent hypervascularization was 31% (50 of 160 nodules). Independent Cox multivariable predictors of increased risk of hypervascularization were hyperintensity on T2-weighted images (hazard ratio [HR] = 8.7; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.6, 20.8), previous local therapy for hypervascular HCC (HR = 5.0; 95% CI: 1.8, 13.6), Child-Pugh B cirrhosis (HR = 3.6; 95% CI: 1.4, 9.5) and coexistence of hypervascular HCC (HR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.0, 3.8). The mean growth rate was significantly higher in nodules that showed subsequent hypervascularization than in those without hypervascularization. Kaplan-Meier analysis based on the receiver operating characteristic cutoff level (1.8 \u00d7 10(-3)/day [tumor volume doubling time, 542 days]) showed that nodules with a higher growth rate had a significantly higher incidence of hypervascularization (P = 5.2 \u00d7 10(-8), log-rank test).Hyperintensity on T2-weighted images is an independent and strong risk factor at baseline for subsequent hypervascularization in hypovascular nodules in patients with chronic liver disease. Tumor volume doubling time of less than 542 days was associated with a high rate of subsequent hypervascularization.",
        "To evaluate the technical quality and the diagnostic performance of a protocol with use of low volumes of contrast medium (25 mL) at 64-detector spiral computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis and management of adult, nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).This study was performed outside the United States and was approved by the institutional review board. Intracranial CT angiography was performed in 73 consecutive patients with nontraumatic SAH diagnosed at nonenhanced CT. Image quality was evaluated by two observers using two criteria: degree of arterial enhancement and venous contamination. The two independent readers evaluated diagnostic performance (lesion detection and correct therapeutic decision-making process) by using rotational angiographic findings as the standard of reference. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated for patients who underwent CT angiography and three-dimensional rotational angiography. The intraclass correlation coefficient was calculated to assess interobserver concordance concerning aneurysm measurements and therapeutic management.All aneurysms were detected, either ruptured or unruptured. Arterial opacification was excellent in 62 cases (85%), and venous contamination was absent or minor in 61 cases (84%). In 95% of cases, CT angiographic findings allowed optimal therapeutic management. The intraclass correlation coefficient ranged between 0.93 and 0.95, indicating excellent interobserver agreement.With only 25 mL of iodinated contrast medium focused on the arterial phase, 64-detector CT angiography allowed satisfactory diagnostic and therapeutic management of nontraumatic SAH.",
        "To evaluate the diagnostic performance of gray-scale ultrasonography (US) and elastography in differentiating benign and malignant thyroid nodules.This was an institutional review board-approved retrospective study with waiver of informed consent. A total of 703 solid thyroid nodules in 676 patients (mean age, 49.7 years; range, 18-79 years) were included; there were 556 women (mean age, 49.5 years; range, 20-74 years) and 120 men (mean age, 50.7 years; range, 18-79 years). Nodules with marked hypoechogenicity, poorly defined margins, microcalcifications, and a taller-than-wide shape were classified as suspicious at grayscale US. Findings at elastography were classified according to the Rago criteria and the Asteria criteria. The diagnostic performances of gray-scale US and elastography were compared. For comparison between the diagnostic performances of gray-scale US and the combination of gray-scale US and elastography, three sets of criteria were assigned: criteria set 1, nodules with any suspicious grayscale US feature were assessed as suspicious; criteria set 2, Rago criteria were added as suspicious features to criteria set 1; and criteria set 3, Asteria criteria were added as suspicious features to criteria set 1. The diagnostic performances of gray-scale US, elastography with Rago criteria, and elastography with Asteria criteria, and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals for predicting thyroid malignancy were compared using generalized estimating equation analysis.Of 703 nodules, 217 were malignant and 486 were benign. Sensitivity, negative predictive value (NPV), and OR of gray-scale US for the 703 nodules were 91.7%, 94.7%, and 22.1, respectively, and these values were higher than the 15.7% and 65.4% sensitivity, 71.7% and 79.1% NPV, and 3.7 and 2.6 ORs found for elastography with Rago and Asteria criteria, respectively. Specificity, positive predictive value, and accuracy for criteria set 1 were significantly higher than those for criteria sets 2 and 3 for most of the nodule subgroups that were considered.Elastography alone, as well as the combination of elastography and gray-scale US, showed inferior performance in the differentiation of malignant and benign thyroid nodules compared with gray-scale US features; elastography was not a useful tool in recommending fine-needle aspiration biopsy.",
        "Background: The main renal and interlobar arteries flow volume (Q), resistive index (RI), and pulsatility index (PI) are important diagnostic Doppler ultrasonographic parameters used in monitoring progression of renal diseases. There is paucity of literature on the normaladults\u2019 values in our environment. This study determined the normal adult\u2019s main renal andinterlobar arteries RI, PI and Q and evaluated their relationship with age, sex, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean blood pressure (MBP), pulse pressure (PP), pulse rate (PR) and bipolar renal length (BPL). The study also established the correlation of the interlobar with the main renal arteries Doppler parameters and between the right and the left parameters.\r\nMaterial and Methods: This was a cross-sectional prospective study conducted at the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital over five months period on 470 consenting normal adults. The Doppler ultrasound examinations were performed using 1 \u2013 15 MHz curve transducer with colour and power Doppler capabilities. Descriptive statistic was used todetermine the normal values, while student\u2019s t test, ANOVA and Pearson\u2019s correlationcoefficients were used as appropriate for the correlation studies.

        "To determine adverse reaction rates in a tertiary care clinical setting after adoption of gadoteridol as the institutional routine magnetic resonance (MR) imaging contrast agent.With institutional review board approval, informed consent waiver, and HIPAA compliance, a prospective observational study of 28 078 patients who underwent intravenous gadoteridol-enhanced MR imaging from July 2007 to December 2009 was performed. Reactions were recorded by technologists who noted types of reactions, method of injection, and treatment. Reactions were classified as mild, moderate, or severe per American College of Radiology definitions. Comparisons of reaction rates with dose and method of injection were analyzed with the Fisher exact and \u03c7(2) tests.Overall reaction rate was 0.666% (187 patients), including 177 mild, six moderate, and four severe reactions. Treatment was given in 27 patients (14.4%). The most frequent reaction was nausea (and/or vomiting) in 149 patients (79.7% of patients with any adverse reaction, 0.530% of overall population). Method of injection did not affect reaction rate or severity. There was no difference in type or severity of reactions in comparison of patients receiving half the dose versus patients receiving the standard dose (P = .33-.75).The observed adverse reaction rate to gadoteridol was lower than previously reported. Specifically, the rate of nausea (0.530%) was less than half the rate (1.4%) in clinical trials of 1251 patients, leading to FDA approval in 1992. Rates of adverse reactions for this macrocyclic contrast agent are comparable to those published for linear gadolinium-based contrast agents.",
        "Background In 2017, the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) included an algorithm for the assessment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with local-regional therapy. The aim of the algorithm was to enable standardized evaluation of treatment response to guide subsequent therapy. However, the performance of the algorithm has not yet been validated in the literature. Purpose To evaluate the performance of the LI-RADS 2017 Treatment Response algorithm for assessing the histopathologic viability of HCC treated with bland arterial embolization. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included patients who underwent bland arterial embolization for HCC between 2006 and 2016 and subsequent liver transplantation. Three radiologists independently assessed all treated lesions by using the CT/MRI LI-RADS 2017 Treatment Response algorithm. Radiology and posttransplant histopathology reports were then compared. Lesions were categorized on the basis of explant pathologic findings as either completely (100%) or incompletely (<100%) necrotic, and performance characteristics and predictive values for the LI-RADS Treatment Response (LR-TR) Viable and Nonviable categories were calculated for each reader. Interreader association was calculated by using the Fleiss \u03ba. Results A total of 45 adults (mean age, 57.1 years \u00b1 8.2; 13 women) with 63 total lesions were included. For predicting incomplete histopathologic tumor necrosis, the accuracy of the LR-TR Viable category for the three readers was 60%-65%, and the positive predictive value was 86%-96%. For predicting complete histopathologic tumor necrosis, the accuracy of the LR-TR Nonviable category was 67%-71%, and the negative predictive value was 81%-87%. By consensus, 17 (27%) of 63 lesions were categorized as LR-TR Equivocal, and 12 of these lesions were incompletely necrotic. Interreader association for the LR-TR category was moderate (\u03ba = 0.55; 95% confidence interval: 0.47, 0.67). Conclusion The Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System 2017 Treatment Response algorithm had high predictive value and moderate interreader association for the histopathologic viability of hepatocellular carcinoma treated with bland arterial embolization when lesions were assessed as Viable or Nonviable. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019",
        "History A 78-year-old woman presented to a community hospital after an unwitnessed fall at her nursing home. Initial head computed tomography (CT) performed in the emergency department showed vasogenic edema in the right temporal parietal region, which prompted her transfer to our institution for additional work-up. Further history taking revealed recurrent transient motor and sensory transient ischemic attack-like symptoms over the preceding weeks. She denied having a fever or night sweats. There was no history of infection, bleeding, immunodeficiency, intravenous drug use, alcohol or tobacco abuse, malignancy, or genetic disorders. Her medical history included memory impairment and a left posterior cerebral artery territory infarction. She was not known to have any systemic inflammatory disorder. Physical examination findings at presentation were noncontributory. She was not taking any anticoagulants or immunosuppressive medication. Pertinent hematologic laboratory investigations revealed a white blood cell count of 6.7 \u00d7 10(9), a C-reactive protein level of 29 mg/L (276.2 nmol/L) (normal value, <10 mg/L [95.2 nmol/L]), and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 35 mm per hour (normal value, 0-10 mm per hour).

        "Purpose To assess the performance of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems and to determine the dominant ultrasonographic (US) features when classifying benign versus malignant focal liver lesions (FLLs) by using contrast material-enhanced US cine clips. Materials and Methods One hundred six US data sets in all subjects enrolled by three centers from a multicenter trial that included 54 malignant, 51 benign, and one indeterminate FLL were retrospectively analyzed. The 105 benign or malignant lesions were confirmed at histologic examination, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and/or 6 or more months of clinical follow-up. Data sets included 3-minute cine clips that were automatically corrected for in-plane motion and automatically filtered out frames acquired off plane. B-mode and contrast-specific features were automatically extracted on a pixel-by-pixel basis and analyzed by using an artificial neural network (ANN) and a support vector machine (SVM). Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) for CAD were compared with those for one experienced and one inexperienced blinded reader. A third observer graded cine quality to assess its effects on CAD performance. Results CAD, the inexperienced observer, and the experienced observer were able to analyze 95, 100, and 102 cine clips, respectively. The AUCs for the SVM, ANN, and experienced and inexperienced observers were 0.883 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.793, 0.940), 0.829 (95% CI: 0.724, 0.901), 0.843 (95% CI: 0.756, 0.903), and 0.702 (95% CI: 0.586, 0.782), respectively; only the difference between SVM and the inexperienced observer was statistically significant. Accuracy improved from 71.3% (67 of 94; 95% CI: 60.6%, 79.8%) to 87.7% (57 of 65; 95% CI: 78.5%, 93.8%) and from 80.9% (76 of 94; 95% CI: 72.3%, 88.3%) to 90.3% (65 of 72; 95% CI: 80.6%, 95.8%) when CAD was in agreement with the inexperienced reader and when it was in agreement with the experienced reader, respectively. B-mode heterogeneity and contrast material washout were the most discriminating features selected by CAD for all iterations. CAD selected time-based time-intensity curve (TIC) features 99.0% (207 of 209) of the time to classify FLLs, versus 1.0% (two of 209) of the time for intensity-based features. None of the 15 video-quality criteria had a statistically significant effect on CAD accuracy-all P values were greater than the Holm-Sidak \u03b1-level correction for multiple comparisons. Conclusion CAD systems classified benign and malignant FLLs with an accuracy similar to that of an expert reader. CAD improved the accuracy of both readers. Time-based features of TIC were more discriminating than intensity-based features. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To compare the diagnostic performance of the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging\u2013based Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) and a Likert scale in the detection of prostate cancer in a cohort of patients undergoing initial prostate biopsy. Materials and Methods This institutional review board\u2013approved two-center prospective study included 118 patients with normal digital rectal examination (DRE) results but elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels (4\u201320 ng/mL) who were referred for initial prostate biopsies and had one suspicious (Likert scale score, \u22653) focus at prebiopsy 1.5-T multiparametric MR imaging performed with T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted [DW], and dynamic contrast material\u2013enhanced imaging. Targeted core biopsies and random systematic core biopsies were performed. The elementary unit for analysis was the core. Relationships were assessed by using the Mann-Whitney U test. Yates corrected and Pearson \u03c72 tests were used to evaluate categoric variables. A training set was randomly drawn to construct the receiver operating characteristic curves for the summed PI-RADS scores and for the Likert scale scores. The thresholds to recommend biopsy were obtained from the Youden J statistics and were tested in the remaining validation set in terms of predictive characteristics. Interobserver variability was analyzed by using weighed \u03ba statistics in a random set of 50 patients. Results Higher T2-weighted, DW, and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging PI-RADS scores were observed in areas that yielded cancer-positive cores. The percentage of positive cores increased with the sum of scores aggregated in five classes as follows: For summed PI-RADS scores of 3\u20135, the percentage of positive cores was 2.3%; for scores of 6\u20138, it was 5.8%; for scores of 9 or 10, it was 24.7%; for scores of 11 or 12, it was 51.8%; and for scores of 13\u201315, it was 72.1% (P for trend, <.0001). For the threshold of summed PI-RADS scores of 9 or greater, sensitivity was 86.6%, specificity was 82.4%, the positive predictive value was 52.4%, the negative predictive value was 96.5%, and accuracy was 83.2%. The respective data for Likert scale scores of 3 or greater were 93.8%, 73.6%, 44.3%, 98.1%, and 73.3%. Good interobserver agreement was observed for the Likert scale (\u03ba = 0.80) and the summed PI-RADS (\u03ba = 0.73) scoring systems. Conclusion PI-RADS provided the site-specific stratified risk of cancer-positive cores in biopsy-naive men with normal DRE results and elevated PSA levels. There was no significant difference between summed PI-RADS scores of 9 or greater and Likert scale scores of 3 or greater in the detection of cancer in the peripheral zone. \u00a9 RSNA, 2015",
        "Purpose To compare malignancy risk stratification of thyroid nodules with the 2014 American Thyroid Association (ATA) management guidelines and the Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TIRADS). Materials and Methods This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board. The requirement to obtain informed consent was waived. From November 2013 to July 2014, 1293 thyroid nodules in 1241 patients (mean age, 50.8 years \u00b1 13.5) were included in this study. All nodules measured at least 10 mm. Solidity, hypoechogenicity or marked hypoechogenicity, microlobulated to irregular margin, microcalcifications or mixed calcifications, and nonparallel shape were considered suspicious features at ultrasonography (US). A TIRADS category and the US pattern as determined with ATA guidelines were assigned to each nodule. The correlation between the TIRADS category or ATA pattern and the malignancy rate was evaluated with the Spearman rank test. Results Of the 1293 thyroid nodules, 1059 (81.9%) were benign and 234 (18.1%) were malignant. Forty-four of the 1293 nodules (3.4%) did not meet the criteria for the ATA patterns and were classified as \"not specified.\" The malignancy rates of TIRADS category 3, 4a, 4b, 4c, and 5 nodules were 1.9% (six of 316 nodules), 4.2% (17 of 408 nodules), 12.9% (33 of 256 nodules), 49.8% (130 of 261 nodules), and 92.3% (48 of 52 nodules), respectively, with significant differences between categories (P < .001). Malignancy rates of nodules with very low, low, intermediate, and high suspicion for malignancy with the ATA guidelines and not specified patterns were 2.7% (11 of 407 nodules), 3.1% (10 of 323 nodules), 16.7% (39 of 233 nodules), 58.0% (166 of 286 nodules), and 18.2% (eight of 44 nodules), respectively, with significant differences between patterns (P < .001). There was high correlation between classification with TIRADS (r = 1.000, P < .001) and ATA guidelines (r = 0.900, P = 0.037), without statistically significant differences (P = .873). Conclusion Both TIRADS and the ATA guidelines provide effective malignancy risk stratification for thyroid nodules. Nodules that do not meet the criteria for a specific pattern with the ATA guidelines have a relatively high risk of malignancy (18.2%). \u00a9 RSNA, 2015 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To investigate longitudinal changes in global and regional brain volume in patients 1 year after mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) and to correlate such changes with clinical and neurocognitive metrics. Materials and Methods This institutional review board\u2013approved study was HIPAA compliant. Twenty-eight patients with MTBI (with 19 followed up at 1 year) with posttraumatic symptoms after injury and 22 matched control subjects (with 12 followed up at 1 year) were enrolled. Automated segmentation of brain regions to compute regional gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volumes was performed by using three-dimensional T1-weighted 3.0-T magnetic resonance imaging, and results were correlated with clinical metrics. Pearson and Spearman rank correlation coefficients were computed between longitudinal brain volume and neurocognitive scores, as well as clinical metrics, over the course of the follow-up period. Results One year after MTBI, there was measurable global brain atrophy, larger than that in control subjects. The anterior cingulate WM bilaterally and the left cingulate gyrus isthmus WM, as well as the right precuneal GM, showed significant decreases in regional volume in patients with MTBI over the 1st year after injury (corrected P < .05); this was confirmed by means of cross-sectional comparison with data in control subjects (corrected P < .05). Left and right rostral anterior cingulum WM volume loss correlated with changes in neurocognitive measures of memory (r = 0.65, P = .005) and attention (r = 0.60, P = .01). At 1-year follow-up, WM volume in the left cingulate gyrus isthmus correlated with clinical scores of anxiety (Spearman rank correlation r = \u22120.68, P = .007) and postconcussive symptoms (Spearman rank correlation r = \u22120.65, P = .01). Conclusion These observations demonstrate structural changes to the brain 1 year after injury after a single concussive episode. Regional brain atrophy is not exclusive to moderate and severe traumatic brain injury but may be seen after mild injury. In particular, the anterior part of the cingulum and the cingulate gyrus isthmus, as well as the precuneal GM, may be distinctively vulnerable 1 year after MTBI. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "Purpose To assess adherence with annual or biennial screening mammography after a diagnosis of high-risk lesion(s) at stereotactic biopsy with or without surgical excision and to identify clinical factors that may affect screening adherence after a high-risk diagnosis. Materials and Methods This institutional review board-approved HIPAA-compliant retrospective study included 208 patients who underwent stereotactic biopsy between January 2012 and December 2014 that revealed a high-risk lesion. Whether the patient underwent surgical excision and/or follow-up mammography was documented. Adherence of these women to a protocol of subsequent mammography within 1 year (9-18 months) or within 2 years (9-30 months) was compared with that of 45 508 women with normal screening mammograms who were imaged during the same time period at the same institution. Possible factors relevant to postdiagnosis management and screening adherence were assessed. Consultation with a breast surgeon was identified by reviewing clinical notes. Uptake of pharmacologic chemoprevention following diagnosis (patient decision to take chemopreventive medications) was assessed. The Fisher exact test was used to compare annual or biennial screening adherence rates. Binary logistic regression was used to identify factors predictive of whether women returned for screening within selected time frames. Results In total, 913 (1.3%) of 67 874 women were given a recommendation to undergo stereotactic biopsy, resulting in diagnosis of 208 (22.8%) of 913 high-risk lesions. Excluding those with a prior personal history of breast cancer or upgrade to cancer at surgery, 124 (66.7%) of 186 women underwent surgery and 62 (33.3%) did not. Overall post-high-risk diagnosis adherence to annual or biennial mammography was similar to that in control subjects (annual, 56.4% vs 50.8%, P = .160; biennial, 62.0% vs 60.1%, P = .630). Adherence was significantly better in the surgical group than in the nonsurgical group for annual mammography (70.0% vs 32.0%; odds ratio [OR] = 5.0; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.4, 10.1; P < .001) and for biennial mammography (74.3% vs 40.0%; OR = 4.3; 95% CI: 2.1, 8.8; P < .001). Among the patients in the nonsurgical group, those adherent to annual or biennial mammography were significantly more likely to have seen a breast surgeon than the nonadherent women (annual, 77.3% vs 35.7%, P = .005; biennial, 67.9% vs 36.4%, P = .045). All patients receiving chemopreventive agents underwent a surgical consultation (100%; n = 21). Conclusion Although diagnosis of a high-risk lesion at stereotactic breast biopsy did not compromise overall adherence to subsequent mammographic screening, patients without surgical excision, particularly those who did not undergo a surgical consultation, had significantly lower imaging adherence and chemoprevention uptake as compared with their counterparts who underwent surgery, suggesting that specialist care may be important in optimizing management. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018.",
        "To compare the effective fetal dose reduction at different stages of gestation during maternal computed tomographic (CT) pulmonary angiography by using traditional lead apron and bismuth-antimony shields combined with limited z-axis and tube current.Phantom with gravid prosthesis, 0.5-mm lead, and two grades of bismuth-antimony shield was used. Thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) measured radiation in the first- to third-trimester uterus. Fetal dose was determined for each gestation by using 100 kVp to the costophrenic angles (CPAs) with and without shielding for a total of 12 scans. Eight third-trimester scans were used to compare shields using 120 kVp to CPAs versus those using 100 kVp to the diaphragm.Average fetal dose increased with gestation with use of 100 kVp to CPAs, from 0.11 mGy in first trimester to 0.50 mGy in third trimester. Average third-trimester unshielded fetal dose was reduced from 0.82 mGy by using 120 kVp to CPAs to 0.17 mGy (79%, P < .001) by using 100 kVp to the diaphragm. Lead apron reduced dose more than either of the bismuth-antimony shields (72%-79% vs 57%-81%) with use of 100 kVp to CPAs. Shields reduced the dose by 73% (lead), 62% (90% attenuation bismuth-antimony), and 72% (95% attenuation bismuth-antimony) (P < .01) at 120 kVp to CPAs. No significant difference between shields was demonstrated with 100 kVp to the diaphragm (P < .01). Maternal dose was 8.13 mSv at 120 kVp to CPAs, 4.90 mSv at 100 kVp to CPAs, and 4.02 mSv at 100 kVp to the diaphragm.Reducing voltage and limiting z-axis is more effective than shields at reducing fetal dose. Shielding improves reduction with no significant difference between lead and bismuth-antimony shields when conservative scanning parameters are observed.",
        "These recommendations for measuring pulmonary nodules at computed tomography (CT) are a statement from the Fleischner Society and, as such, incorporate the opinions of a multidisciplinary international group of thoracic radiologists, pulmonologists, surgeons, pathologists, and other specialists. The recommendations address nodule size measurements at CT, which is a topic of importance, given that all available guidelines for nodule management are essentially based on nodule size or changes thereof. The recommendations are organized according to practical questions that commonly arise when nodules are measured in routine clinical practice and are, together with their answers, summarized in a table. The recommendations include technical requirements for accurate nodule measurement, directions on how to accurately measure the size of nodules at the workstation, and directions on how to report nodule size and changes in size. The recommendations are designed to provide practical advice based on the available evidence from the literature; however, areas of uncertainty are also discussed, and topics needing future research are highlighted. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To develop and test an artificial intelligence (AI) system, based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for automated real-time triaging of adult chest radiographs on the basis of the urgency of imaging appearances. Materials and Methods An AI system was developed by using 470 388 fully anonymized institutional adult chest radiographs acquired from 2007 to 2017. The free-text radiology reports were preprocessed by using an in-house natural language processing (NLP) system modeling radiologic language. The NLP system analyzed the free-text report to prioritize each radiograph as critical, urgent, nonurgent, or normal. An AI system for computer vision using an ensemble of two deep CNNs was then trained by using labeled radiographs to predict the clinical priority from radiologic appearances only. The system's performance in radiograph prioritization was tested in a simulation by using an independent set of 15 887 radiographs. Prediction performance was assessed with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were also determined. Nonparametric testing of the improvement in time to final report was determined at a nominal significance level of 5%. Results Normal chest radiographs were detected by our AI system with a sensitivity of 71%, specificity of 95%, PPV of 73%, and NPV of 94%. The average reporting delay was reduced from 11.2 to 2.7 days for critical imaging findings (P < .001) and from 7.6 to 4.1 days for urgent imaging findings (P < .001) in the simulation compared with historical data. Conclusion Automated real-time triaging of adult chest radiographs with use of an artificial intelligence system is feasible, with clinically acceptable performance. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Purpose To develop a radiomics signature to estimate disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with early-stage (stage I-II) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and assess its incremental value to the traditional staging system and clinical-pathologic risk factors for individual DFS estimation. Materials and Methods Ethical approval by the institutional review board was obtained for this retrospective analysis, and the need to obtain informed consent was waived. This study consisted of 282 consecutive patients with stage IA-IIB NSCLC. A radiomics signature was generated by using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, or LASSO, Cox regression model. Association between the radiomics signature and DFS was explored. Further validation of the radiomics signature as an independent biomarker was performed by using multivariate Cox regression. A radiomics nomogram with the radiomics signature incorporated was constructed to demonstrate the incremental value of the radiomics signature to the traditional staging system and other clinical-pathologic risk factors for individualized DFS estimation, which was then assessed with respect to calibration, discrimination, reclassification, and clinical usefulness. Results The radiomics signature was significantly associated with DFS, independent of clinical-pathologic risk factors. Incorporating the radiomics signature into the radiomics-based nomogram resulted in better performance (P < .0001) for the estimation of DFS (C-index: 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71, 0.73) than with the clinical-pathologic nomogram (C-index: 0.691; 95% CI: 0.68, 0.70), as well as a better calibration and improved accuracy of the classification of survival outcomes (net reclassification improvement: 0.182; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.31; P = .02). Decision curve analysis demonstrated that in terms of clinical usefulness, the radiomics nomogram outperformed the traditional staging system and the clinical-pathologic nomogram. Conclusion The radiomics signature is an independent biomarker for the estimation of DFS in patients with early-stage NSCLC. Combination of the radiomics signature, traditional staging system, and other clinical-pathologic risk factors performed better for individualized DFS estimation in patients with early-stage NSCLC, which might enable a step forward precise medicine. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To identify cerebral radiomic features related to diagnosis and subtyping of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and to build and evaluate classification models for ADHD diagnosis and subtyping on the basis of the identified features.

Features representing the shape properties of gray matter and diffusion properties of white matter were extracted for each participant. The initial feature set was input into an all-relevant feature selection procedure within cross-validation loops to identify features with significant discriminative power for diagnosis and subtyping. Random forest classifiers were constructed and evaluated on the basis of identified features. Results No overall difference was found between children with ADHD and control subjects in total brain volume (1069830.00 mm3 \u00b1 90743.36 vs 1079 213.00 mm3 \u00b1 92742.25, respectively; P = .51) or total gray and white matter volume (611978.10 mm3 \u00b1 51622.81 vs 616960.20 mm3 \u00b1 51872.93, respectively; P = .53; 413532.00 mm3 \u00b1 41 114.33 vs 418173.60 mm3 \u00b1 42395.48, respectively; P = .47). The mean classification accuracy achieved with classifiers to discriminate patients with ADHD from control subjects was 73.7%. Alteration in cortical shape in the left temporal lobe, bilateral cuneus, and regions around the left central sulcus contributed significantly to group discrimination. The mean classification accuracy with classifiers to discriminate ADHD-I from ADHD-C was 80.1%, with significant discriminating features located in the default mode network and insular cortex. Conclusion The results of this study provide preliminary evidence that cerebral morphometric alterations can allow discrimination between patients with ADHD and control subjects and also between the most common ADHD subtypes. By identifying features relevant for diagnosis and subtyping, these findings may advance the understanding of neurodevelopmental alterations related to ADHD. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Background X-ray dark-field radiography takes advantage of the wave properties of x-rays, with a relatively high signal in the lungs due to the many air-tissue interfaces in the alveoli. Purpose To describe the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of x-ray dark-field images in healthy human subjects. Materials and Methods Between October 2018 and January 2020, patients of legal age who underwent chest CT as part of their diagnostic work-up were screened for study participation. Inclusion criteria were a normal chest CT scan, the ability to consent, and the ability to stand upright without help. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, serious medical conditions, and changes in the lung tissue, such as those due to cancer, pleural effusion, atelectasis, emphysema, infiltrates, ground-glass opacities, or pneumothorax. Images of study participants were obtained by using a clinical x-ray dark-field prototype, recently constructed and commissioned at the authors' institution, to simultaneously acquire both attenuation-based and dark-field thorax radiographs. Each subject's total dark-field signal was correlated with his or her lung volume, and the dark-field coefficient was correlated with age, sex, weight, and height. Results Overall, 40 subjects were included in this study (average age, 62 years \u00b1 13 [standard deviation]; 26 men, 14 women). Normal human lungs have high signal, while the surrounding osseous structures and soft tissue have very low and no signal, respectively. The average dark-field signal was 2.5 m-1 \u00b1 0.4 of examined lung tissue. There was a correlation between the total dark-field signal and the lung volume (r = 0.61, P < .001). No difference was found between men and women (P = .78). Also, age (r = -0.18, P = .26), weight (r = 0.24, P = .13), and height (r = 0.01, P = .96) did not influence dark-field signal. Conclusion This study introduces qualitative and quantitative values for x-ray dark-field imaging in healthy human subjects. The quantitative x-ray dark-field coefficient is independent from demographic subject parameters, emphasizing its potential in diagnostic assessment of the lung. \u00a9RSNA, 2021 See also the editorial by Hatabu and Madore in this issue.",
        "Background The first clinical CT system to use photon-counting detector (PCD) technology has become available for patient care. Purpose To assess the technical performance of the PCD CT system with use of phantoms and representative participant examinations. Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval and written informed consent from four participants were obtained. Technical performance of a dual-source PCD CT system was measured for standard and high-spatial-resolution (HR) collimations. Noise power spectrum, modulation transfer function, section sensitivity profile, iodine CT number accuracy in virtual monoenergetic images (VMIs), and iodine concentration accuracy were measured. Four participants were enrolled (between May 2021 and August 2021) in this prospective study and scanned using similar or lower radiation doses as their respective clinical examinations performed on the same day using energy-integrating detector (EID) CT. Image quality and findings from the participants' PCD CT and EID CT examinations were compared. Results All standard technical performance measures met accreditation and regulatory requirements. Relative to filtered back-projection reconstructions, images from iterative reconstruction had lower noise magnitude but preserved noise power spectrum shape and peak frequency. Maximum in-plane spatial resolutions of 125 and 208 \u00b5m were measured for HR and standard PCD CT scans, respectively. Minimum values for section sensitivity profile full width at half maximum measurements were 0.34 mm (0.2-mm nominal section thickness) and 0.64 mm (0.4-mm nominal section thickness) for HR and standard PCD CT scans, respectively. In a 120-kV standard PCD CT scan of a 40-cm phantom, VMI iodine CT numbers had a mean percentage error of 5.7%, and iodine concentration had root mean squared error of 0.5 mg/cm",
        "Purpose To compare lesion detection and image quality of chest computed tomographic (CT) images acquired at various tube current\u2013time products (40\u2013150 mAs) and reconstructed with adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) or filtered back projection (FBP). Materials and Methods In this Institutional Review Board\u2013approved HIPAA-compliant study, CT data from 23 patients (mean age, 63 years \u00b1 7.3 [standard deviation]; 10 men, 13 women) were acquired at varying tube current\u2013time products (40, 75, 110, and 150 mAs) on a 64-row multidetector CT scanner with 10-cm scan length. All patients gave informed consent. Data sets were reconstructed at 30%, 50%, and 70% ASIR-FBP blending. Two thoracic radiologists assessed image noise, visibility of small structures, lesion conspicuity, and diagnostic confidence. Objective noise and CT number were measured in the thoracic aorta. CT dose index volume, dose-length product, weight, and transverse diameter were recorded. Data were analyzed by using analysis of variance and the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results FBP had unacceptable noise at 40 and 75 mAs in 17 and five patients, respectively, whereas ASIR had acceptable noise at 40\u2013150 mAs. Objective noise with 30%, 50%, and 70% ASIR blending (11.8 \u00b1 3.8, 9.6 \u00b1 3.1, and 7.5 \u00b1 2.6, respectively) was lower than that with FBP (15.8 \u00b1 4.8) (P < .0001). No lesions were missed on FBP or ASIR images. Lesion conspicuity was graded as well seen on both FBP and ASIR images (P < .05). Mild pixilated blotchy texture was noticed with 70% blended ASIR images. Conclusion Acceptable image quality can be obtained for chest CT images acquired at 40 mAs by using ASIR without any substantial artifacts affecting diagnostic confidence. \u00a9 RSNA, 2011 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.11101450/-/DC1",
        "Purpose To determine the diagnostic performance of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) parameters and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) to assess response to combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy (CRT) in patients with rectal cancer by using histogram analysis derived from whole-tumor volumes and single-section regions of interest (ROIs). Materials and Methods The institutional review board approved this retrospective study of 31 patients with rectal cancer who underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging before and after CRT, including diffusion-weighted imaging with 34 b values prior to surgery. Patient consent was not required. ADC, perfusion-related diffusion fraction (f), slow diffusion coefficient (D), and fast diffusion coefficient (D*) were calculated on MR images acquired before and after CRT by using biexponential fitting. ADC and IVIM histogram metrics and median values were obtained by using whole-tumor volume and single-section ROI analyses. All ADC and IVIM parameters obtained before and after CRT were compared with histopathologic findings by using t tests with Holm-Sidak correction. Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated to evaluate the diagnostic performance of IVIM parameters derived from whole-tumor volume and single-section ROIs for prediction of histopathologic response. Results Extreme values aside, results of histogram analysis of ADC and IVIM were equivalent to median values for tumor response assessment (P > .06). Prior to CRT, none of the median ADC and IVIM diffusion metrics correlated with subsequent tumor response (P > .36). Median D and ADC values derived from either whole-volume or single-section analysis increased significantly after CRT (P \u2264 .01) and were significantly higher in good versus poor responders (P \u2264 .02). Median IVIM f and D* values did not significantly change after CRT and were not associated with tumor response to CRT (P > .36). Interobserver agreement was excellent for whole-tumor volume analysis (range, 0.91-0.95) but was only moderate for single-section ROI analysis (range, 0.50-0.63). Conclusion Median D and ADC values obtained after CRT were useful for discrimination between good and poor responders.

        "Purpose To evaluate the validity and reproducibility of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging\u2013based ovarian morphologic measurements for diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in adolescents. Materials and Methods This case-control study included 110 adolescent girls (age range, 13\u201317 years) who underwent pelvic MR imaging in 2006\u20132015. The case group included girls with high (n = 40, hyperandrogenism and oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea), intermediate (n = 8, hyperandrogenism), or low (n = 7, oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea) suspicion of PCOS. Control subjects were 55 age-matched (\u00b1 2 years) girls with no clinical hyperandrogenism, oligomenorrhea, or amenorrhea. The validity (sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]) of the number of follicles per ovary (FPO) measuring 9 mm or smaller (FPO-9) and FPO measuring 5 mm or smaller (FPO-5), ovarian volume (OV), sphericity index, peripheral distribution of follicles, and absence of a dominant follicle were determined, with girls who were highly suspected of having PCOS compared with control subjects as the reference. Two radiologists independently measured these criteria in 50 girls who were suspected of having PCOS to assess reproducibility (\u03ba and intraclass correlation coefficients [ICCs]). Results All criteria except sphericity index and absence of a dominant follicle were significantly associated with the level of suspicion of PCOS (P \u2264 .05). The AUCs for FPO-9 (0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.68, 0.87), FPO-5 (0.73; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.83), and OV (0.77; 95% CI: 0.68, 0.87) were significantly greater than 0.5; that was not true for sphericity index (AUC, 0.58; 95% CI: 0.47, 0.70). Sensitivity and specificity for peripheral distribution of follicles were 33% (95% CI: 19%, 49%) and 95% (95% CI: 85%, 99%), respectively; for absence of a dominant follicle, they were 90% (95% CI: 76%, 97%) and 27% (95% CI: 16%, 41%), respectively. Reproducibility was almost perfect for OV (ICC, 0.89), substantial for absence of a dominant follicle (\u03ba, 0.74), moderate for FPO-9 (ICC, 0.54) and FPO-5 (ICC, 0.61), and fair for peripheral distribution of follicles (\u03ba, 0.37). Conclusion The most accurate MR imaging\u2013based diagnostic criteria for PCOS were OV, FPO-9, and peripheral distribution of follicles; however, reproducibility of these measures was moderate, except that for OV (ICC, 0.89). \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To prospectively evaluate apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) histograms in the prediction of chemotherapy response in patients with metastatic ovarian or primary peritoneal cancer.Research ethics committee approval and patient written informed consent were obtained. Diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed through the abdomen and pelvis before and after one and three cycles of chemotherapy in 42 women (mean age, 63.0 years \u00b1 11.4 [standard deviation]) with newly diagnosed or recurrent disease. Reproducibility and intra- and interobserver agreement of ADC calculations were assessed. Per-patient weighted ADC histograms were generated at each time point from pixel ADCs from five or fewer target lesions. Mean ADC, percentiles (10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th), skew, kurtosis, and their change were analyzed according to histologic grade, primary versus recurrent disease status, and response, determined with integrated biochemical and morphologic criteria, with a linear mixed model. Areas under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) for combinations of parameters were calculated with linear discriminant analysis.Coefficients of variation for repeat measurements and for within and between observers were 4.8%, 11.4%, and 13.7%, respectively. Grade and disease status did not significantly affect histogram parameters. Pretreatment ADCs were not predictive of response. In responders, all ADCs increased after the first and third cycle (P < .001), while skew and kurtosis decreased after the third (P < .001 and P = .006, respectively); however, in nonresponders, no parameter changed significantly. Percentage change of the 25th percentile performed best in identifying response (AUC = 0.82 and 0.83 after first and third cycle, respectively), whereas combination of parameters did not improve accuracy.An early increase of ADCs and later decrease of skew and kurtosis characterize chemotherapy response. Quantitative DW MR imaging can aid in early monitoring of treatment efficacy in patients with advanced ovarian cancer.",
        "Background: The prevalence of male infertility in our environment is largely unknown while in the western world, it is estimated to be about 30% with male factor responsible for close to 50% of cases. Apart from seminal fluid analysis, there is no universal consensus on the mode of evaluation of men with infertility. This is a prospective study that evaluated the role of scrotal ultrasonography in men with infertility.Methodology: The study examined 220 subjects over a period of one year. The subjects comprised of one hundred and thirty-six patients with diagnosis of male infertility, as well as 84 healthy individuals as control. The relevant clinical history of each patient was extracted from their case notes.All the subjects had their testes examined using a high frequency 7.5mHz linear transducer of an Aloka (Prosound SDD-3500 Plus, Japan 2005) ultrasound scanner.The results were expressed as percentages and tests of significance were done using the chi-square and student t-test. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Results: The mean age for infertile patients was 36.80+0.98 years while the peak age for both groups, was 30-39years.2There was a statistically significant difference between the testicular volumes in fertile and infertile men, while there was an inverse relationship between testicular volume and severity of oligospermia.The overall proportion of scrotal abnormalities was 93% in infertile men versus 26% in control group. Varicocele was the most common abnormal finding occurring in 63.2% and 11.9% of infertile and normal patients respectively. There was a 2.9% and 0% incidence of suspected early stage testicular tumor in the infertile and control groups respectively.Conclusion: Scrotal ultrasonography was able to detect potentially curable causes of infertility in more than half of the infertile men and was able to detect testicular tumors at a potentially curable stage. Scrotal ultrasonography is recommended as a valuable tool for the evaluation of men with infertility.",
        "BackgroundContrast agent-enhanced digital mammography (CEDM) has been shown to be more sensitive and specific than two-dimensional full-field digital mammography in the diagnostic setting. Few studies have reported on its performance in the screening setting.PurposeTo evaluate the performance of CEDM for breast cancer screening.Materials and MethodsThis retrospective study included women who underwent dual-energy CEDM for breast cancer screening from December 2012 through April 2016. Medical records were reviewed for age, risk factors, short-interval follow-up and biopsies recommended, and cancers detected. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value of abnormal findings at screening (PPV1), positive predictive value of biopsy performed (PPV3), and negative predictive value were determined.ResultsIn the study period 904 baseline CEDMs were performed. Mean age was 51.8 years \u00b1 9.4 (standard deviation). Of 904 patients, 700 (77.4%) had dense breasts, 247 (27.3%) had a family history of breast cancer in a first-degree relative age 50 years or younger, and 363 (40.2%) a personal history of breast cancer. The final Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System score was 1 or 2 in 832 of 904 (92.0%) patients, score of 3 in 25 of 904 (2.8%) patients, and score of 4 or 5 in 47 of 904 (5.2%) patients. By using CEDM, 15 cancers were diagnosed in 14 of 904 women (cancer detection rate, 15.5 of 1000). PPV3 was 29.4% (15 of 51). At least 1-year follow up was available in 858 women. There were two interval cancers. Sensitivity was 50.0% (eight of 16; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 24.7%, 75.3%) on the low-energy images compared with 87.5% (14 of 16; 95% CI: 61.7%, 98.4%) for the entire study (low-energy and iodine images; P = .03). Specificity was 93.7% (789 of 842; 95% CI: 91.8%, 95.2%); PPV1 was 20.9% (14 of 67; 95% CI: 11.9%, 32.6%), and negative predictive value was 99.7% (789 of 791; 95% CI: 99.09%, 99.97%).ConclusionContrast-enhanced digital mammography is a promising technique for screening women with higher-than-average risk for breast cancer.\u00a9 RSNA, 2019.",
        "Purpose To evaluate the prognostic importance and predictive performance of volume-based parameters of fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in patients with stage I non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Materials and Methods This study had institutional review board approval. All patients gave written informed consent for SBRT as well as for future anonymous use of clinical data. Data in 88 patients with stage I NSCLC (68 patients with T1N0M0 disease and 20 with T2aN0M0 disease) who had undergone FDG PET/CT and then SBRT were retrospectively evaluated. Seventy-seven tumors were histopathologically proved (48 adenocarcinomas, 24 squamous cell carcinomas, and five unspecified non\u2013small cell carcinomas), and the remaining 11 tumors were diagnosed clinically without histopathologic diagnosis. Maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) were analyzed. The MTV of the primary tumor was calculated as all voxels with an SUV of 2.5 or greater within the isocontour line, while TLG was calculated as MTV multiplied by the average SUV, by using fixed thresholds of either 50% (TLG50) or 60% (TLG60) of the maximum intratumoral FDG activity. The prognostic importance of PET parameters and other clinicopathologic variables (age, sex, tumor size, tumor location [peripheral or central], and biologically effective dose) was assessed by using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis of overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) for both univariate and multiple-variable analyses. Results The median follow-up period was 33 months. At 3 years, OS and DFS were 70.0% and 49.7%, respectively. In the univariate analyses, SUVmax (P = .001), MTV (P = .002), TLG50 (P = .001), and TLG60 (P < .001) were found to be significantly associated with DFS. In multiple variable analysis, these parameters were also significantly associated with DFS (P = .011 for SUVmax, P = .010 for MTV, P = .004 for TLG50, and P = .005 for TLG60). Only volumetric parameters (MTV, TLG50, and TLG60) were significant indicators of DFS in patients with tumors larger than 3 cm. Conclusion SUVmax, MTV, and TLG at FDG PET/CT have a prognostic role for patients with NSCLC treated with SBRT. When tumors are larger than 3 cm, only MTV and TLG are predictive of DFS. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To demonstrate the feasibility of foot blood flow measurement by using dynamic volume perfusion computed tomographic (CT) technique with the upslope method in an animal experiment and a human study.The human study was approved by the institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. The animal study was approved by the research animal care and use committee. A perfusion CT experiment was first performed by using rabbits. A color-coded perfusion map was reconstructed by using in-house perfusion analysis software based on the upslope method, and the measured blood flow on the map was compared with the reference standard microsphere method by using correlation analysis. A total of 17 perfusion CT sessions were then performed (a) once in five human patients and (b) twice (before and after endovascular revascularization) in six human patients. Perfusion maps of blood flow were reconstructed and analyzed. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to prove significant differences in blood flow before and after treatment.The animal experiment demonstrated a strong correlation (R(2) = 0.965) in blood flow between perfusion CT and the microsphere method. Perfusion maps were obtained successfully in 16 human clinical sessions (94%) with the use of 32 mL of contrast medium and an effective radiation dose of 0.31 mSv (k factor for the ankle, 0.0002). The plantar dermis showed the highest blood flow among all anatomic structures of the foot, including muscle, subcutaneous tissue, tendon, and bone. After a successful revascularization procedure, the blood flow of the plantar dermis increased by 153% (P = .031). The interpretations of the color-coded perfusion map correlated well with the clinical and angiographic findings.Perfusion CT could be used to measure foot blood flow in both animals and humans. It can be a useful modality for the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease by providing quantitative information on foot perfusion status.",
        "Background: Diabetes mellitus (DM), a devastating disease, is one of the major global public health burdens. In Port-Harcourt, the prevalence of type 2 DM is estimated at 7.9%. Diabetic individuals are more prone to advanced atherosclerosis, a known risk factor for stroke. DM has been reported as one of the commonest factors for stroke at the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital (UPTH), Port Harcourt. Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) is a marker of the degree of atherosclerosis with resulting carotid haemodynamic changes and these have been found useful in predicting the risk of stroke in type 2 diabetics.\r\nAims and Objectives: To sonographically evaluate the CIMT and blood flow velocities in type 2 diabetics and to compare the findings to those of non-diabetics.\r\nMaterials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional comparative study carried out between February, 2015 and June, 2016. Participants were recruited from UPTH and Braithwaite Memorial Specialist Hospital (BMSH), Port Harcourt. Seven-hundred participants, comprising equal number of type 2 diabetics and non-diabetics aged 18 years and above, had colour Doppler ultrasound scan of the carotid arteries; to measure CIMT and blood flow velocities. The results in the type 2 diabetic group were compared with those of non-diabetic group. Sonographic parameters were correlated with age, gender and BMI. CIMT was also correlated with duration of diabetes. Data was analyzed using statistical package for social sciences (SPSS), version 21 for Windows. P-values \u2264 0.05 (5% level of significance), were considered significant.\r\nResults: There were 174(49.7%) males and 176(50.3%) females among the 350 type 2 diabetic participants, while there were 158(45.1%) males and 192(54.9%) females among the 350 non-diabetic participants. Mean age for type 2 diabetic group was 59.3\u00b110.2 years, while the mean age for the non-diabetic group was 49.6\u00b112.4 years. The cumulative mean\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsonographic parameters measured, stated as type 2 diabetic group versus non-diabetic group were as follows, CIMT: 1.09\u00b10.25mm vs 0.94\u00b10.24mm, CCA PSV: 105.43\u00b120.68cm/s vs 112.16\u00b117.07cm/s, CCA EDV: 26.63\u00b111.65cm/s vs 29.65\u00b16.62cm/s, ICA PSV: 90.58\u00b120.29cm/s vs 97.39\u00b114.56cm/s, ICA EDV: 26.79\u00b17.66cm/s vs 30.85\u00b16.88cm/s and ICA/CCA PSV ratio: 1.33\u00b10.29 vs 1.33\u00b10.26.\r\nConclusion: Type 2 diabetic patients had significantly higher CIMT values than non- diabetics (p = 0.001); CIMT increased with advancing age in both groups. Carotid blood flow velocities in the common carotid and internal carotid arteries were significantly lower in type 2 diabetics compared to non-diabetics. CIMT also increased significantly with duration of DM (r=0.194, p=0.001). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of carotid plaques between type 2 diabetics and non-diabetics (p = 0.32).\r\nKey words: Doppler, Diabetes mellitus, CIMT, Carotid Blood Flow Velocities.",
        "Intravenous iodinated contrast media are commonly used with CT to evaluate disease and to determine treatment response. The risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) developing in patients with reduced kidney function following exposure to intravenous iodinated contrast media has been overstated. This is due primarily to historic lack of control groups sufficient to separate contrast-induced AKI (CI-AKI; ie, AKI caused by contrast media administration) from contrast-associated AKI (CA-AKI; ie, AKI coincident to contrast media administration). Although the true risk of CI-AKI remains uncertain for patients with severe kidney disease, prophylaxis with intravenous normal saline is indicated for patients who have AKI or an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 who are not undergoing maintenance dialysis. In individual high-risk circumstances, prophylaxis may be considered in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30\u201344 mL/min/1.73 m2 at the discretion of the ordering clinician.

        "A 33-year-old pregnant woman (gravida 11, para 8) presented with increasing severe abdominal pain during the first trimester of pregnancy and increasing abdominal distention out of proportion to her prior pregnancies. Ultrasonography (US) without Doppler performed at another hospital had revealed a pelvic mass; therefore, this patient had been referred to our institution for further evaluation. Unenhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was then performed at 8 weeks of gestation. The main portion of the gravid uterus and the ovaries was not seen on these images, but the parts that were seen appeared normal. Diagnostic laparoscopic biopsy was performed during the first trimester, but complete removal of the mass was deferred because of fears the pregnancy would be lost. The patient was closely observed throughout the pregnancy with serial US until the 37th week of gestation, at which time the patient underwent Caesarian section. At the time of Caesarian section, the mass was noted to extend from the spleen downward deep into the pelvis. A biopsy was performed at the time of Caesarian section. Definitive removal of the mass was deferred at the time of Caesarian section to minimize postpartum blood loss and to further delineate the mass with imaging for future surgery. Intravenous contrast material-enhanced (120 mL of Omnipaque 350; Nycomed Amersham, Princeton, NJ) computed tomography (CT) was performed 3 days after Caesarian section. The cystic component measured approximately 15 HU. Repeat MR imaging 1.5 months after Caesarian section was then performed. No loss of signal intensity in the mass was seen on fat-saturated images. There was no evidence of local or distant metastatic disease. The mass abutted and displaced the uterus and the ovaries but did not distort either of these organs. Vascular anatomy was not useful in determining the origin of the mass. The comprehensive metabolic panel and complete blood count were normal throughout and after the pregnancy.",
        "Background Commercial low-field-strength MRI systems are generally not equipped with state-of-the-art MRI hardware, and are not suitable for demanding imaging techniques. An MRI system was developed that combines low field strength (0.55 T) with high-performance imaging technology. Purpose To evaluate applications of a high-performance low-field-strength MRI system, specifically MRI-guided cardiovascular catheterizations with metallic devices, diagnostic imaging in high-susceptibility regions, and efficient image acquisition strategies. Materials and Methods A commercial 1.5-T MRI system was modified to operate at 0.55 T while maintaining high-performance hardware, shielded gradients (45 mT/m; 200 T/m/sec), and advanced imaging methods. MRI was performed between January 2018 and April 2019. T1, T2, and T2* were measured at 0.55 T; relaxivity of exogenous contrast agents was measured; and clinical applications advantageous at low field were evaluated. Results There were 83 0.55-T MRI examinations performed in study participants (45 women; mean age, 34 years \u00b1 13). On average, T1 was 32% shorter, T2 was 26% longer, and T2* was 40% longer at 0.55 T compared with 1.5 T. Nine metallic interventional devices were found to be intrinsically safe at 0.55 T (<1\u00b0C heating) and MRI-guided right heart catheterization was performed in seven study participants with commercial metallic guidewires. Compared with 1.5 T, reduced image distortion was shown in lungs, upper airway, cranial sinuses, and intestines because of improved field homogeneity. Oxygen inhalation generated lung signal enhancement of 19% \u00b1 11 (standard deviation) at 0.55 T compared with 7.6% \u00b1 6.3 at 1.5 T (P = .02; five participants) because of the increased T1 relaxivity of oxygen (4.7e\u22124 mmHg\u22121sec\u22121). Efficient spiral image acquisitions were amenable to low field strength and generated increased signal-to-noise ratio compared with Cartesian acquisitions (P < .02). Representative imaging of the brain, spine, abdomen, and heart generated good image quality with this system. Conclusion This initial study suggests that high-performance low-field-strength MRI offers advantages for MRI-guided catheterizations with metal devices, MRI in high-susceptibility regions, and efficient imaging. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "To retrospectively review diagnostic mammography in women diagnosed with breast cancer who previously had mantle field radiation therapy for Hodgkin disease in England and Wales over a period of 30 years.From a national cohort study of 5002 women treated with supradiaphragmatic radiation therapy when they were younger than 36 years (mean, 22.1 years) during 1956-2003, 392 patients developed breast cancer. With ethics committee approval and informed consent, mammograms were obtained that showed 230 tumors in 222 (56.6%) patients from 95 hospitals, and the size and appearance of each carcinoma was recorded by two breast radiologists. Comparison was made with a historical report of more than 1000 general-population breast cancers by using Pearson \u03c7(2) test.Thirty-eight tumors were occult on mammograms. Mean tumor maximum diameter was 12.3 mm (n = 81) on oblique view. The quadrant distribution of the tumors was significantly different (P < .001) from the historic controls, and chest radiation therapy patients had a greater proportion of tumors in the upper outer (66.9% [107 of 160] vs 48.7% [385 of 784]) and, to a lesser extent, lower inner (10.6% [17 of 160] vs 7.8% [61 of 784]) quadrants. The dominant radiologic feature was of an irregular mass (56.8% [109 of 192]) followed by microcalcifications (25.0% [48 of 192]).This study suggests that in patients who previously underwent mantle radiation therapy for Hodgkin disease, breast cancers are more commonly seen within the upper outer quadrants than are cancers in the general population. Poorly defined masses were the most common appearance.",

        "INTRODUCTION: Infertility is a major health problem in Nigeria, with a prevalence of 15%6 it accounts for almost two- thirds of visits to the gynecologist and the number of people with this condition is on the increase. Different invasive scientific methods such as biopsies, serum hormonal assay, endometrial secretion analysis and hysterosalpingogram had been used to study the problem of infertility in respect to the ovary and the endometrium. Ultrasound examination on the other hand is a non invasive procedure which make use of non ionizing energy for the purpose of imaging. METHODOLOGY: Two groups of infertile patients that met the set criteria\u2019s were involved in the study over a period of one year, from December 2009 to November 2010. Group A consisted of 100 infertile women whose cause of infertility is outside hypothalamic pituitary ovarian axis and were spontaneously menstruating. While group B consisted of 100 infertile women that are on ovarian stimulating drug. The women were scanned on day 10 of their menstrual cycle (i.e. before ovulation), with transabdominal technique immediately preceding transvaginal technique in a single scanning session.Image quality was assessed by the ability of each sonographic technique to resolve the endometrium into a trilamilar echo pattern as expected during the pre-ovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle and by the definition of the ovarian follicular margin which was graded as well defined or poorly defined.RESULTS: Endometrial thickness (ET), dominant follicular size, endometrial and follicular image quality of 200 infertile patients age ranging from 21 to 42years (mean 33.9years) were analysed Most patients were in the 26-35years age range (56.5%) and the least in the extremes of the age ranges.CONCLUSION: There is similarity in the use of transabdominal and transvaginal sonographic technique in the measurement of ovarian follicular size and endometrial thickness in infertile women but image resolution of transvaginal technique is superior to that of transabdominal sonographic technique.",
        "History A 34-year-old man without underlying medical conditions came to the emergency department for evaluation of persistent pain over the volar portion of his right fifth finger after a fall during a football match 3 days before. At physical examination, the injured finger was swollen and purple. Passive and active flexion of the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints were compromised, without interphalangeal instability. Radiography was performed in the emergency department, and the patient was released with a diagnosis of a fifth digit sprain. After the senior radiologist (V.M.C.) reviewed the radiographs, the patient was called back for assessment with ultrasonography (US) on the same day. US was performed with an Aplio 500 unit (Toshiba Medical Systems, Tokyo, Japan) using a multifrequency linear array 7.2-18.0-MHz PLT-1204BX transducer focused at the level of the flexor tendon. The patient was sitting in front of the examiner, with the hand lying palm up on the examination bed. No abnormality was observed during color Doppler US.",
        "To compare structured versus nonstructured reporting of multiphasic computed tomography (CT) for staging of pancreatic cancer and the effects of both types of reporting on subjective assessment of resectability.This institutional review board-approved, HIPAA-compliant retrospective study with waiver of informed consent included all patients who were referred for presurgical multiphasic CT of the pancreas between December 2006 and April 2011 at one institution before and after implementation (April 2008) of a structured reporting template. The template was created specifically for reporting multiphasic CT results to stage pancreatic cancer in patients and contained specific information relevant to surgical and oncologic planning. Multiphasic CT reports were assessed for the presence of 12 key features required for staging and surgical planning, including location, size, enhancement, node status, and vascular involvement. Three pancreatic surgeons evaluated the reports to assess resectability, surgical planning, and ease of extracting information before and after reviewing the multiphasic CT images blinded to the patient identifiers. The Student t test and \u03c7(2) test were used for statistical analysis.Forty-eight (40%) structured and 72 (60%) nonstructured multiphasic CT reports were reviewed. Nonstructured reports contained a mean \u00b1 standard deviation of 7.3 key features \u00b1 2.1 (range, 1-11) and structured reports contained 10.6 \u00b1 0.9 (range, 9-12) features (P < .001). Information for surgical planning was deemed easily accessible in 94%, 60%, and 98% of structured and 47%, 54%, and 32% of nonstructured reports by the three surgeons, respectively (P < .001, .79, < .001). Surgeons had sufficient information for surgical planning in 96%, 69%, and 98% of structured and 31%, 43%, and 25% of nonstructured reports (P < .001, .009, and < .001). When surgeons reviewed reports in combination with multiphasic CT images, they were more likely to convert an answer of \"unsure\" regarding resectability to a definitive answer (ie, resectable or unresectable) when the reports were structured than when they were nonstructured.Structured reporting of pancreatic multiphasic CT provided superior evaluation of pancreatic cancer and facilitated surgical planning. Surgeons were more confident regarding decisions about tumor resectability when they reviewed structured reports before review of multiphasic CT images.",
        "Purpose To assess whether an association exists between hyperintensity in the dentate nucleus (DN) on unenhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images and previous administration of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) that contain different types of gadolinium chelates. Materials and Methods The institutional review board approved this study. Written informed consent was waived because this was a retrospective study. Evaluated were 127 cases among 360 consecutive patients who underwent contrast agent\u2013enhanced brain MR imaging. Two radiologists conducted visual evaluation and quantitative analysis on unenhanced T1-weighted MR images by using regions of interest. DN-to-cerebellum (DN/cerebellum) signal intensity ratios were calculated and the relationship between DN/cerebellum and several factors was evaluated, including the number of previous linear chelate and/or macrocyclic GBCA administrations by using a generalized additive model. The Akaike information criterion was used in model selection. Interobserver correlation was evaluated with paired t tests and the Lin concordance correlation coefficient. Results The images of nine patients (7.1%) showed hyperintensity in the DN. Twenty-three patients (18.1%) received linear GBCAs (median, two patients; maximum, 11 patients), 36 patients (28.3%) received macrocyclic GBCAs (median, two patients; maximum, 15 patients), 14 patients (11.0%) received both types of GBCA (linear [median, two patients; maximum, five patients] and macrocyclic [median, three patients; maximum, eight patients]), and 54 patients (42.5%) had no history of administration of gadolinium chelate. Interobserver correlation was almost perfect (0.992 [95% confidence interval: 0.990, 0.994]). The DN/cerebellum ratio was associated with linear GBCA (P < .001), but not with macrocyclic GBCA exposure (P = .875). According to the Akaike information criterion, only linear GBCA was selected for the final model, and the DN/cerebellum ratio had strong association only with linear GBCA. Conclusion Hyperintensity in the DN on unenhanced T1-weighted MR images is associated with previous administration of linear GBCA, while the previous administration of macrocyclic GBCAs showed no such association. \u00a9 RSNA, 2015",
        "Background The biologic meaning of prognostic radiomics phenotypes remains poorly understood, hampered in part by lack of multicenter reproducible evidence. Purpose To uncover the biologic meaning of individual prognostic radiomics phenotypes in glioblastomas using paired MRI and RNA sequencing data and to validate the reproducibility of the identified radiogenomics linkages externally. Materials and Methods This retrospective multicenter study included four data sets gathered between January 2015 and December 2016. From a radiomics analysis set, a 13-feature radiomics signature was built using preoperative MRI for overall survival prediction. Using a radiogenomics training set with both MRI and RNA sequencing, biologic pathways were enriched and correlated with each of the 13 radiomics phenotypes. Radiomics-correlated key genes were identified to derive a prognostic radiomics gene expression (RadGene) score. The reproducibility of identified pathways and genes was validated with an external test set and a public data set (The Cancer Genome Atlas [TCGA]). A log-rank test was performed to assess prognostic significance. Results A total of 435 patients (mean age, 55 years \u00b1 15 [standard deviation]; 263 men) were enrolled. The radiomics signature was associated with overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 3.68; 95% CI: 2.08, 6.52; P < .001) in the radiomics validation subset. Four types of prognostic radiomics phenotypes were correlated with distinct pathways: immune, proliferative, treatment responsive, and cellular functions (false-discovery rate < 0.10). Thirty radiomics-correlated genes were identified. The prognostic significance of the RadGene score was confirmed in an external test set (HR, 2.02; 95% CI: 1.19, 3.41; P = .01) and a TCGA test set (HR, 1.43; 95% CI: 1.001, 2.04; P = .048). The radiomics-associated pathways and key genes can be replicated in an external test set. Conclusion Individual radiomics phenotypes on MRI scans predictive of overall survival were driven by distinct key pathways involved in immune regulation, tumor proliferation, treatment responses, and cellular functions in glioblastoma, which could be reproduced externally. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To evaluate conventional ultrasonography (US), US elasticity imaging (EI), and acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging in thyroid nodule malignancy prediction.This prospective study was institutional review board approved; informed consent was obtained. Study included 375 patients (mean age, 51 years; range, 18-75 years) with 441 pathologically proven thyroid nodules. In 281 women (mean age, 50 years; range, 18-75 years) and 94 men (mean age, 53 years; range, 18-74 years), conventional US, EI, Virtual Touch tissue imaging (VTi; Siemens, Mountain View, Calif), and Virtual Touch tissue quantification (VTq; Siemens) of ARFI imaging were performed for each nodule. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess 17 independent variables for malignancy prediction. Diagnostic performance was evaluated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.There were 325 benign and 116 malignant nodules. Marked hypoechogenicity (odds ratio [OR]: 83.88; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 17.81, 394.99) was the strongest independent predictor for thyroid malignancy, followed by shape taller than wide (OR: 8.69; 95% CI: 2.87, 26.31), VTi (OR: 6.54; 95% CI: 3.61, 11.88), moderate hypoechogenicity (OR: 3.98; 95% CI: 1.13, 14.05), poorly defined margin (OR: 3.27; 95% CI: 1.22, 8.77), female sex (OR: 2.55; 95% CI: 1.33, 4.91), coarse background of surrounding thyroid tissue (OR: 2.01; 95% CI: 1.12, 3.62), and VTq (OR: 1.78; 95% CI: 1.28, 2.47) (all P < .05). EI was not significantly associated with thyroid malignancy (P = .855). Area under the ROC curve (Az) for VTq and VTi was higher than that with other significant independent variables. Az, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.91 (95% CI: 0.87, 0.94) and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.82, 0.90), 80% and 71.6%, and 93.8% and 83.4%, respectively, for VTi and VTq. VTq of at least 2.87 m/sec and VTi of at least grade IV were the best cutoff values for malignant thyroid nodules.ARFI imaging is promising for malignant thyroid nodule prediction, with higher diagnostic performance than conventional US or EI. ARFI can be used to supplement conventional US to diagnose thyroid nodules in patients referred for surgery.",
        "To assess the diagnostic accuracy of diffusion kurtosis magnetic resonance imaging parameters in grading gliomas.The institutional review board approved this prospective study, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Diffusion parameters-mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), mean kurtosis, and radial and axial kurtosis-were compared in the solid parts of 17 high-grade gliomas and 11 low-grade gliomas (P<.05 significance level, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test, Bonferroni correction). MD, FA, mean kurtosis, radial kurtosis, and axial kurtosis in solid tumors were also normalized to the corresponding values in contralateral normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) and the contralateral posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC) after age correction and were compared among tumor grades.Mean, radial, and axial kurtosis were significantly higher in high-grade gliomas than in low-grade gliomas (P = .02, P = .015, and P = .01, respectively). FA and MD did not significantly differ between glioma grades. All values, except for axial kurtosis, that were normalized to the values in the contralateral NAWM were significantly different between high-grade and low-grade gliomas (mean kurtosis, P = .02; radial kurtosis, P = .03; FA, P = .025; and MD, P = .03). When values were normalized to those in the contralateral PLIC, none of the considered parameters showed significant differences between high-grade and low-grade gliomas. The highest sensitivity and specificity for discriminating between high-grade and low-grade gliomas were found for mean kurtosis (71% and 82%, respectively) and mean kurtosis normalized to the value in the contralateral NAWM (100% and 73%, respectively). Optimal thresholds for mean kurtosis and mean kurtosis normalized to the value in the contralateral NAWM for differentiating high-grade from low-grade gliomas were 0.52 and 0.51, respectively.There were significant differences in kurtosis parameters between high-grade and low-grade gliomas; hence, better separation was achieved with these parameters than with conventional diffusion imaging parameters.",
        "History A 68-year-old man was admitted to the hospital for work-up because of generalized fatigue, anorexia, chronic diarrhea, and weight loss. Laboratory work-up revealed an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 58 mm/h (reference range, 3-23 mm/h), a hemoglobin level of 14.1 g/dL (reference range, 13.8-17.5 g/dL), a leukocyte count of 8.1 \u00d7 109/L (reference range, [3.4-9.7] \u00d7 109/L), a platelet count of 223 \u00d7 109/L (reference range, [158-424] \u00d7 109/L), an alkaline phosphatase level of 85 U/L (1.42 \u03bckat/L) (normal level, <142 U/L [2.37 \u03bckat/L]), a serum creatinine level of 93 \u03bcmol/L (reference range, 79-125 \u03bcmol/L), a serum total protein level of 82 g/L (reference range, 66-81 g/L), a serum albumin level of 39.3 g/L (reference range, 40.2-47.6 g/L), an albumin-to-globulin ratio (a test showing relative amounts of major plasma proteins) of 0.92 (reference range, 0.8-2.0), a urine protein level of 15 mg/dL (normal level, <20 mg/dL), a total serum calcium level of 2.46 mmol/L (reference range, 2.14-2.53 mmol/L), and a carcinoembryonic antigen value of 2.69 \u03bcg/L (normal value, <3.4 \u03bcg/L). Serology findings were negative for celiac disease. Thyroid function was normal, as were 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and chromogranin A levels. Initial radiologic examination included chest radiography and plain abdominal erect radiography. Gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed to rule out inflammatory bowel disease or gastrointestinal neoplasm as a cause of chronic diarrhea. Endoscopic mucosal resection of two polyps from the cardia and duodenal bulb was performed during esophagogastroduodenoscopy, but histologic findings at hematoxylin-eosin staining were normal. Colonoscopy revealed diverticulosis involving the entire colon. Serum immunoelectrophoresis showed a monoclonal band, which was confirmed to be immunoglobulin M\u03bb at immunofixation. After histologic analysis of the bone marrow biopsy specimen, diagnosis of Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia was established, and computed tomography (CT) of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis was requested to depict lymphadenopathy and organomegaly. On the basis of CT findings, two more specimens considered highly sensitive for the CT diagnosis were obtained via minimally invasive biopsy, but the results were negative. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed a year later to control the progression of CT findings.",
        "Background A preoperative predictive model is needed that can be used to identify patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) who have a higher risk of recurrence or metastasis. Purpose To investigate associations between CT-based radiomic consensus clustering of stage I LUAD and clinical-pathologic features, genomic data, and patient outcomes. Materials and Methods Patients who underwent complete surgical resection for LUAD from April 2014 to December 2017 with preoperative CT and next-generation sequencing data were retrospectively identified. Comprehensive radiomic analysis was performed on preoperative CT images; tumors were classified as solid, ground glass, or mixed. Patients were clustered into groups based on their radiomics features using consensus clustering, and clusters were compared with tumor genomic alterations, histopathologic features, and recurrence-specific survival (Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous data, \u03c7",
        "History A 43-year-old right-handed man presented with a history of progressive mild left-sided weakness and slowness of movements. Symptoms began 4 years earlier, and the patient noticed a progressive decline in his daily routine due to gait difficulties in the past year. There was no history of head trauma, surgery, drug therapy, smoking, or alcohol abuse, nor was there any relevant family history. Examination revealed normal cognition (29 of 30 points on the Mini-Mental State Examination and 27 of 30 points on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment) and normal cerebellar, sensory, cranial nerve, and autonomic function. There was mild left-sided weakness involving the upper and lower limbs (medical research council graded muscle strength as 4+ out of 5) that was associated with facial hypomimia and a rigid akinetic syndrome only in the patient's left hemibody (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale [UPDRS] part III [motor examination], 23 out of 52 points). Mild atrophy in the left upper and lower limbs without pain, swelling, or skin lesions was noted at physical examination. Routine blood chemistry was normal, as were serum creatine kinase and aldolase levels and thyroid, hepatic, and renal function. T1- and T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, diffusion- and perfusion-weighted, and contrast material-enhanced brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging results were normal, without basal ganglia hyperintensity, lacunae, calcification, or heavy metal deposits. Muscle MR imaging and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with technetium 99m (99mTc) tropane dopamine transporter (TRODAT)-1 were performed for further evaluation. This patient received levodopa and benserazide (200 and 50 mg, respectively) four times a day and amantadine (100 mg) three times a day without adequate improvement (UPDRS score decreased from 23 to 20 points).",
        "Purpose To evaluate clinical and immediate postoperative ultrasonographic (US) risk factors associated with vascular thrombosis of pediatric en bloc kidney grafts. Materials and Methods This institutional review board-approved HIPAA-compliant retrospective study consisted of 195 recipients of pediatric en bloc kidney grafts throughout a 10-year period. The average recipient and donor age was 45 years (range, 7-74 years) and 9 months (range, 0-84 months), respectively. Clinical factors and immediate postoperative US findings were assessed. Categorical variables were evaluated by using the Fisher exact test and linear models with generalized estimating equations. Results Seventeen patients (23 kidneys) experienced thrombotic events. In six patients (eight kidneys), thrombosis occurred intraoperatively. The remaining 11 patients (15 kidneys) received a diagnosis of thrombosis on postoperative days 1-13. Recipients more than 40 years old had a higher incidence of arterial thrombosis than did younger recipients (eight of 62 vs three of 133, respectively; P < .01). Recipients were more likely to develop thrombosis with donor weight less than 5 kg (10 of 52 vs seven of 140 with donor weight of \u2265 5 kg; P < .01), with intraoperative perfusional concern (10 of 21 vs seven of 174 without; P < .01), or with right-sided allograft placement (10 of 64 vs seven of 131 left sided; P = .03). At US of the 15 postoperative thrombotic events, the incidence of thrombosis was greater when donor arterial velocity was less than 100 cm/sec (seven of 56 vs four of 126 with velocity \u2265 100 cm/sec; P = .04). An intrarenal arterial resistive index of less than 0.6 was associated with higher incidence of arterial thrombosis (nine of 123 vs zero of 217, respectively; P = .01). A resistive index greater than 0.8 was associated with a higher incidence of venous thrombosis (four of 13 vs one of 217, respectively; P = .04). Conclusion Clinical factors and immediate US findings can help stratify patients receiving pediatric en bloc kidneys into risk categories for vascular thrombosis that, if proven in prospective studies, could affect immediate postoperative treatment.

        "To assess the incremental value of split-bolus multidetector computed tomography (CT) combined with fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) for follow-up of oncologic patients.The institutional ethics committee approved the use of this protocol. Thirty-eight oncologic patients who underwent FDG PET/unenhanced multidetector CT and split-bolus multidetector CT for restaging were investigated retrospectively. The split-bolus CT protocol included imaging during the hepatic arterial and portal venous phases in one scan. Software was used for fusion of the independently acquired FDG PET and split-bolus CT data, and fused datasets were compared with FDG PET/unenhanced CT data. The standard of reference for diagnosis of lesions in all patients was a combination of histologic results (if available), clinical results (medical history, physical examination, and laboratory test results), and the results of follow-up imaging (conventional CT, magnetic resonance imaging, and/or ultrasonography) for at least 6 months. Descriptive statistics were used.Fifty-nine true-positive lesions were identified with fused FDG PET/split-bolus CT; 41 were concordant and detected with both split-bolus CT and PET/unenhanced CT, 16 with split-bolus CT only, and two with PET/unenhanced CT. Two different false-positive lesions were identified with PET/unenhanced CT and PET/split-bolus CT. Furthermore, in 20 of 38 (53%) patients, FDG PET/split-bolus CT allowed detection of important additional findings (n = 40) not detected at FDG PET/unenhanced CT. Both the tumor-related findings (n = 13, 32.5%) and the non-tumor-related findings (n = 27, 67.5%) were important to the clinical treatment of these patients.Fused FDG PET/split-bolus multidetector CT provides additional information compared with FDG PET/unenhanced multidetector CT in oncologic patients.",
        "To formulate radiation precautions for patients with thyroid cancer who are undergoing thyroid hormone withdrawal-induced hypothyroidism and iodine 131 ((131)I) therapy through actual biokinetic measurements.Informed consent and institutional review board approval were obtained. From October 2008 to December 2011, consecutive patients with differentiated thyroid cancer who had been prepared for (131)I ablation treatment or (131)I treatment for metastatic disease during follow-up were prospectively recruited. Calculations based on deduced whole-body retention and measured iodine biokinetics in thyroidal tissue were derived to determine the thyroidal and extrathyroidal compartment uptake fractions and effective half-lives. Precaution times necessary to avoid close contact with family members and the general public were derived from these parameters and regulatory dose limits.Seventy-seven patients (36 with ablation treatments, 41 with follow-up treatments) were eligible for the analysis. Actual dose rates from patients after therapeutic (131)I administration were greatly lower than those described in the American Thyroid Association (ATA) and Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) models: The mean initial dose rate at 0.3 m for patients with ablation treatment was only 28% (0.183/0.655 \u00b5Sv/h/MBq) \u00b1 2.9 (standard deviation) (range, 12.1%-38.3%) and 36% (0.183/0.511 \u00b5Sv/h/MBq) \u00b1 3.7 (range, 15.5%-49.1%) of that described in the NRC and ATA models, respectively; the equivalent values for patients with follow-up treatment were only 30% (0.195/0.655 \u00b5Sv/h/MBq) \u00b1 3.5 (range, 12.5%-45.3%) and 38% (0.195/0.511 \u00b5Sv/h/MBq) \u00b1 4.5 (range, 16.0%-58.1%), respectively. The actual mean effective (131)I half-life in the thyroid remnant tissue was greatly lower than that described in the ATA and NRC models: 47.6 versus 175.2 hours.On the basis of the current dose limits, typically administered activities of 3.7 GBq to a patient with ablation treatment or 7.4 GBq to a patient with follow-up treatment required 3 days of sleeping apart for keeping the doses to pregnant women and children below 1 mSv. No precautions were required for non-cosleeping nonpregnant adult family members.",
        "Background Previous studies suggest that use of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms as diagnostic aids may improve the quality of skeletal age assessment, though these studies lack evidence from clinical practice. Purpose To compare the accuracy and interpretation time of skeletal age assessment on hand radiograph examinations with and without the use of an AI algorithm as a diagnostic aid. Materials and Methods In this prospective randomized controlled trial, the accuracy of skeletal age assessment on hand radiograph examinations was performed with (n = 792) and without (n = 739) the AI algorithm as a diagnostic aid. For examinations with the AI algorithm, the radiologist was shown the AI interpretation as part of their routine clinical work and was permitted to accept or modify it. Hand radiographs were interpreted by 93 radiologists from six centers. The primary efficacy outcome was the mean absolute difference between the skeletal age dictated into the radiologists' signed report and the average interpretation of a panel of four radiologists not using a diagnostic aid. The secondary outcome was the interpretation time. A linear mixed-effects regression model with random center- and radiologist-level effects was used to compare the two experimental groups. Results Overall mean absolute difference was lower when radiologists used the AI algorithm compared with when they did not (5.36 months vs 5.95 months; P = .04). The proportions at which the absolute difference exceeded 12 months (9.3% vs 13.0%, P = .02) and 24 months (0.5% vs 1.8%, P = .02) were lower with the AI algorithm than without it. Median radiologist interpretation time was lower with the AI algorithm than without it (102 seconds vs 142 seconds, P = .001). Conclusion Use of an artificial intelligence algorithm improved skeletal age assessment accuracy and reduced interpretation times for radiologists, although differences were observed between centers.

        "Background The use of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) is linked to gadolinium retention in the skeleton of healthy individuals. The mechanism of gadolinium incorporation into bone tissue is not fully understood and requires spatially resolved analysis to locate the gadolinium. Purpose To compare the quantitative distribution of gadolinium retained over time in rodent femur following the administration of gadodiamide and gadobutrol at three different time points. Materials and Methods In this animal study conducted between May 2018 and April 2020, 108 9-week-old healthy rats were repeatedly injected with either gadodiamide, gadobutrol, or saline solution and were killed 1, 3, or 12 months after the last injection. The femurs of six female and six male rats per each group and time point were collected. Quantitative elemental imaging of gadolinium in longitudinal thin sections was performed on one sample per sex with use of laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Gadolinium concentration was determined with use of ICP-MS on the samples of all animals (six per group). Mann-Whitney U tests were applied on pairwise comparisons to determine potential sex effect and GBCA effect on gadolinium concentrations. Results The highest gadolinium retention was observed in the gadodiamide group (concentration, 97-200 nmol \u00b7 g-1), exceeding the mean concentration in the gadobutrol group (6.5-17 nmol \u00b7 g-1). However, the gadolinium distribution pattern was similar for both contrast agents, showing prominent gadolinium retention at endosteal surfaces, in the bone marrow, and in small tissue pores. Gadolinium distribution in cortical bone changed over time, initially showing a thin rim of higher concentration close to the periosteum, which appeared to grow wider and move toward the interior of the femur over 1 year. Conclusion For both gadolinium-based contrast agents, gadolinium retention in rat bone was initially located close to the periosteum and bone cavities and changed with bone remodeling processes. The relevance to long-term storage of gadolinium in humans remains to be determined. \u00a9 RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",

        "Background Stratifying high-risk histopathologic features in endometrial carcinoma is important for treatment planning. Radiomics analysis at preoperative MRI holds potential to identify high-risk phenotypes. Purpose To evaluate the performance of multiparametric MRI three-dimensional radiomics-based machine learning models for differentiating low- from high-risk histopathologic markers\u2014deep myometrial invasion (MI), lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), and high-grade status\u2014and advanced-stage endometrial carcinoma. Materials and Methods This dual-center retrospective study included women with histologically proven endometrial carcinoma who underwent 1.5-T MRI before hysterectomy between January 2011 and July 2015. Exclusion criteria were tumor diameter less than 1 cm, missing MRI sequences or histopathology reports, neoadjuvant therapy, and malignant neoplasms other than endometrial carcinoma. Three-dimensional radiomics features were extracted after tumor segmentation at MRI (T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI). Predictive features were selected in the training set with use of random forest (RF) models for each end point, and trained RF models were applied to the external test set. Five board-certified radiologists conducted MRI-based staging and deep MI assessment in the training set. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) were reported with balanced accuracies, and radiologists' readings were compared with radiomics with use of McNemar tests. Results In total, 157 women were included: 94 at the first institution (training set; mean age, 66 years \u00b1 11 [SD]) and 63 at the second institution (test set; 67 years \u00b1 12). RF models dichotomizing deep MI, LVSI, high grade, and International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage led to AUCs of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.68, 0.88), 0.80 (95% CI: 0.67, 0.93), 0.74 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.86), and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.92), respectively, in the test set. In the training set, radiomics provided increased performance compared with radiologists' readings for identifying deep MI (balanced accuracy, 86% vs 79%; P = .03), while no evidence of a difference was observed in performance for advanced FIGO stage (80% vs 78%; P = .27). Conclusion Three-dimensional radiomics can stratify patients by using preoperative MRI according to high-risk histopathologic end points in endometrial carcinoma and provide nonsignificantly different or higher performance than radiologists in identifying advanced stage and deep myometrial invasion, respectively. \u00a9 RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Background Abdominal and thoracic CT provide a valuable opportunity for osteoporosis screening regardless of the clinical indication for imaging. Purpose To establish reference normative ranges for first lumbar vertebra (L1) trabecular attenuation values across all adult ages to measure bone mineral density (BMD) at routine CT. Materials and Methods Reference data were constructed from 20 374 abdominal and/or thoracic CT examinations performed at 120 kV. Data were derived from adults (mean age, 60 years \u00b1 12 [standard deviation]; 56.1% [11 428 of 20 374] women). CT examinations were performed with (n = 4263) or without (n = 16 111) intravenous contrast agent administration for a variety of unrelated clinical indications between 2000 and 2018. L1 Hounsfield unit measurement was obtained either with a customized automated tool (n = 11 270) or manually by individual readers (n = 9104). The effects of patient age, sex, contrast agent, and manual region-of-interest versus fully automated L1 Hounsfield unit measurement were assessed using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results Mean L1 attenuation decreased linearly with age at a rate of 2.5 HU per year, averaging 226 HU \u00b1 44 for patients younger than 30 years and 89 HU \u00b1 38 for patients 90 years or older. Women had a higher mean L1 attenuation compared with men (P < .008) until menopause, after which both groups had similar values. Administration of intravenous contrast agent resulted in negligible differences in mean L1 attenuation values except in patients younger than 40 years. The fully automated method resulted in measurements that were average 21 HU higher compared with manual measurement (P < .004); at intrapatient subanalysis, this difference was related to the level of transverse measurement used (midvertebra vs off-midline level). Conclusion Normative ranges of L1 vertebra trabecular attenuation were established across all adult ages, and these can serve as a quick reference at routine CT to identify adults with low bone mineral density who are at risk for osteoporosis. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Background Little is known about the long-term lung radiographic changes in patients who have recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), especially those with severe disease. Purpose To prospectively assess pulmonary sequelae and explore the risk factors for fibrotic-like changes in the lung at 6-month follow-up chest CT of survivors of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Materials and Methods A total of 114 patients (80 [70%] men; mean age, 54 years \u00b1 12) were studied prospectively. Initial and follow-up CT scans were obtained a mean of 17 days \u00b1 11 and 175 days \u00b1 20, respectively, after symptom onset. Lung changes (opacification, consolidation, reticulation, and fibrotic-like changes) and CT extent scores (score per lobe, 0\u20135; maximum score, 25) were recorded. Participants were divided into two groups on the basis of their 6-month follow-up CT scan: those with CT evidence of fibrotic-like changes (traction bronchiectasis, parenchymal bands, and/or honeycombing) (group 1) and those without CT evidence of fibrotic-like changes (group 2). Between-group differences were assessed with the Fisher exact test, two-sample t test, or Mann-Whitney U test. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the independent predictive factors of fibrotic-like changes. Results At follow-up CT, evidence of fibrotic-like changes was observed in 40 of the 114 participants (35%) (group 1), whereas the remaining 74 participants (65%) showed either complete radiologic resolution (43 of 114, 38%) or residual ground-glass opacification or interstitial thickening (31 of 114, 27%) (group 2). Multivariable analysis identified age of greater than 50 years (odds ratio [OR]: 8.5; 95% CI: 1.9, 38; P = .01), heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute at admission (OR: 5.6; 95% CI: 1.1, 29; P = .04), duration of hospital stay greater than or equal to 17 days (OR: 5.5; 95% CI: 1.5, 21; P = .01), acute respiratory distress syndrome (OR: 13; 95% CI: 3.3, 55; P < .001), noninvasive mechanical ventilation (OR: 6.3; 95% CI: 1.3, 30; P = .02), and total CT score of 18 or more (OR: 4.2; 95% CI: 1.2, 14; P = .02) at initial CT as independent predictors for fibrotic-like changes in the lung at 6 months. Conclusion Six-month follow-up CT showed fibrotic-like changes in the lung in more than one-third of patients who survived severe coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia. These changes were associated with an older age, acute respiratory distress syndrome, longer hospital stays, tachycardia, noninvasive mechanical ventilation, and higher initial chest CT score. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pneumonia of other diseases share similar CT characteristics, which contributes to the challenges in differentiating them with high accuracy. Purpose To establish and evaluate an artificial intelligence (AI) system for differentiating COVID-19 and other pneumonia at chest CT and assessing radiologist performance without and with AI assistance. Materials and Methods A total of 521 patients with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction results for COVID-19 and abnormal chest CT findings were retrospectively identified from 10 hospitals from January 2020 to April 2020. A total of 665 patients with non\u2013COVID-19 pneumonia and definite evidence of pneumonia at chest CT were retrospectively selected from three hospitals between 2017 and 2019. To classify COVID-19 versus other pneumonia for each patient, abnormal CT slices were input into the EfficientNet B4 deep neural network architecture after lung segmentation, followed by a two-layer fully connected neural network to pool slices together. The final cohort of 1186 patients (132 583 CT slices) was divided into training, validation, and test sets in a 7:2:1 and equal ratio. Independent testing was performed by evaluating model performance in separate hospitals. Studies were blindly reviewed by six radiologists without and then with AI assistance. Results The final model achieved a test accuracy of 96% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 90%, 98%), a sensitivity of 95% (95% CI: 83%, 100%), and a specificity of 96% (95% CI: 88%, 99%) with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95 and area under the precision-recall curve of 0.90. On independent testing, this model achieved an accuracy of 87% (95% CI: 82%, 90%), a sensitivity of 89% (95% CI: 81%, 94%), and a specificity of 86% (95% CI: 80%, 90%) with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.90 and area under the precision-recall curve of 0.87. Assisted by the probabilities of the model, the radiologists achieved a higher average test accuracy (90% vs 85%, \u0394 = 5, P < .001), sensitivity (88% vs 79%, \u0394 = 9, P < .001), and specificity (91% vs 88%, \u0394 = 3, P = .001). Conclusion Artificial intelligence assistance improved radiologists' performance in distinguishing coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia from non\u2013coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia at chest CT. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To compare the diagnostic utility of an investigational optoacoustic imaging device that fuses laser optical imaging (OA) with grayscale ultrasonography (US) to grayscale US alone in differentiating benign and malignant breast masses. Materials and Methods This prospective, 16-site study of 2105 women (study period: 12/21/2012 to 9/9/2015) compared Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) categories assigned by seven blinded independent readers to benign and malignant breast masses using OA/US versus US alone. BI-RADS 3, 4, or 5 masses assessed at diagnostic US with biopsy-proven histologic findings and BI-RADS 3 masses stable at 12 months were eligible. Independent readers reviewed US images obtained with the OA/US device, assigned a probability of malignancy (POM) and BI-RADS category, and locked results. The same independent readers then reviewed OA/US images, scored OA features, and assigned OA/US POM and a BI-RADS category. Specificity and sensitivity were calculated for US and OA/US. Benign and malignant mass upgrade and downgrade rates, positive and negative predictive values, and positive and negative likelihood ratios were compared. Results Of 2105 consented subjects with 2191 masses, 100 subjects (103 masses) were analyzed separately as a training population and excluded. An additional 202 subjects (210 masses) were excluded due to technical failures or incomplete imaging, 72 subjects (78 masses) due to protocol deviations, and 41 subjects (43 masses) due to high-risk histologic results. Of 1690 subjects with 1757 masses (1079 [61.4%] benign and 678 [38.6%] malignant masses), OA/US downgraded 40.8% (3078/7535) of benign mass reads, with a specificity of 43.0% (3242/7538, 99% confidence interval [CI]: 40.4%, 45.7%) for OA/US versus 28.1% (2120/7543, 99% CI: 25.8%, 30.5%) for the internal US of the OA/US device. OA/US exceeded US in specificity by 14.9% (P < .0001; 99% CI: 12.9, 16.9%). Sensitivity for biopsied malignant masses was 96.0% (4553/4745, 99% CI: 94.5%, 97.0%) for OA/US and 98.6% (4680/4746, 99% CI: 97.8%, 99.1%) for US (P < .0001). The negative likelihood ratio of 0.094 for OA/US indicates a negative examination can reduce a maximum US-assigned pretest probability of 17.8% (low BI-RADS 4B) to a posttest probability of 2% (BI-RADS 3). Conclusion OA/US increases the specificity of breast mass assessment compared with the device internal grayscale US alone.

        "Purpose To investigate the clinical utility and longitudinal change of acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) ultrasonographic (US) imaging in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Materials and Methods A retrospective cohort study of patients with chronic hepatitis B who underwent serial ARFI examinations in a tertiary referral center in Taiwan between 2012 and 2016 was conducted. The clinical information and noninvasive liver stiffness measurement tests (ARFI, Fibrosis-4 index [FIB-4], and FibroScan) were collected. Serial ARFI measurements were compared in patients without antiviral therapy (nontreatment group) and during antiviral therapy (treatment group). The linear mixed-effects model with random coefficients was used to compare longitudinal repeated measurements. Results A total of 559 patients undergoing serial ARFI examinations were included. The ARFI value correlated with FIB-4 (correlation coefficient = 0.55, P < .001) and FibroScan (correlation coefficient = 0.69, P < .001) results. There were 314 patients with five or more ARFI measurements in more than 3 years of follow-up. The ARFI value remained unchanged in the nontreatment group (n = 189, from 1.11 to 1.11 m/sec, time trend P = .911). However, the ARFI value declined significantly in the treatment group (n = 125, from 1.63 to 1.37 m/sec, time trend P < .001), both in patients with cirrhosis (n = 51, from 2.15 to 1.75 m/sec, time trend P < .001) and in those without (n = 74, from 1.27 to 1.11 m/sec, time trend P < .001). Conclusion ARFI US imaging is an important clinical noninvasive test for liver stiffness measurement and can be used for serial measurements in the management of chronic hepatitis B. Antiviral therapy significantly reduces liver stiffness during longitudinal follow-up. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "History A 60-year-old woman was diagnosed with a new right upper lobe stage I lung adenocarcinoma and underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for right upper lobectomy. Her postoperative course was complicated by a large pneumothorax after chest tube removal on postoperative day 3. This was managed with repeat right-sided chest tube placement on the same day. The second chest tube was removed on postoperative day 8 without complications. A 2-week postoperative clinic visit was unremarkable. Postoperative chest radiographs on postoperative days 1, 3, and 8 (Fig 1a-1c) are provided. Subsequently, chest CT scanning was performed as part of routine 6-month postsurgical lung cancer surveillance follow-up (Figs 2, 3). The patient had no clinical complaints at routine follow-up. Physical examination revealed well-healed VATS scars in the chest wall. Laboratory results were within normal limits, including a normal white blood cell count of 6400/\u03bcL. Her surgical history included prior left upper lobectomy for remote left upper lobe stage IIIA adenocarcinoma and prior bilateral breast implantation for cosmesis. On the basis of chest CT findings, the patient was transferred from an outside institution.",
        "Polypoid lesions of the gallbladder (PLG) are a common finding on trans-abdominal ultrasound scan (USS). Once discovered the exact nature of the PLG must be elucidated to avoid unnecessary removal of benign lesions. This is particularly difficult for the intermediate sized PLG (5-15 mm). Recent developments, however, such as the higher resolution of USS and the availability of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), mean that the management of PLG can be refined. In this review we outline methods for differentiating malignant from benign lesions and discuss their appropriate management.",

She had a longstanding history of arthritis since early adulthood that predominantly affected her weight-bearing joints. The small joints of her hands and feet were spared. Physical examination findings were notable for the presence of slate gray pigmented areas on the patient\u2019s sclerae, ears, and hands. A urinary catheter sample was noted to turn dark on standing, and the patient reported a lifelong history of darkly discolored urine and dark brown staining of clothing at the axillae. Routine laboratory findings\u2014including full blood count, bone profile, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, urea level, electrolyte levels, and ferritin level\u2014were all within the normal range. Tests for rheumatoid factor and HLA-B27 antigen were negative.

        "In anticipation of breast density notification legislation in the state of California, which would require notification of women with heterogeneously and extremely dense breast tissue, a working group of breast imagers and breast cancer risk specialists was formed to provide a common response framework. The California Breast Density Information Group identified key elements and implications of the law, researching scientific evidence needed to develop a robust response. In particular, issues of risk associated with dense breast tissue, masking of cancers by dense tissue on mammograms, and the efficacy, benefits, and harms of supplementary screening tests were studied and consensus reached. National guidelines and peer-reviewed published literature were used to recommend that women with dense breast tissue at screening mammography follow supplemental screening guidelines based on breast cancer risk assessment. The goal of developing educational materials for referring clinicians and patients was reached with the construction of an easily accessible Web site that contains information about breast density, breast cancer risk assessment, and supplementary imaging. This multi-institutional, multidisciplinary approach may be useful for organizations to frame responses as similar legislation is passed across the United States. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Background Subdural hemorrhage (SDH) is thought to have a benign course in asymptomatic neonates. However, effects on neurodevelopmental outcomes have not been established. Purpose To evaluate neurodevelopmental outcomes, gray matter volumes, and MRI findings in asymptomatic neonates with SDH compared with control neonates. Materials and Methods This retrospective analysis was conducted between 2003 and 2016 and was based on data from the University of North Carolina Early Brain Development Study. Neurodevelopmental outcomes were evaluated at 2 years of age by using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL). All infants were imaged with 3.0-T MRI machines and were evaluated for SDH at baseline (neonates) and at ages 1 and 2 years. Volumetric MRI for brain segmentation was performed at ages 1 and 2 years. A secondary analysis was performed in neonates matched 1:1 with control neonates. Differences in categorical variables were measured by using the Fisher exact test, and the",
        "Purpose To compare the diagnostic performance of two-dimensional (2D) mammography, 2D mammography plus digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), and synthetic 2D mammography plus DBT in depicting malignant radiographic features. Materials and Methods In this multicenter, multireader, retrospective reading study (the TOMMY trial), after written informed consent was obtained, 8869 women (age range, 29\u201385 years; mean, 56 years) were recruited from July 2011 to March 2013 in an ethically approved study. From these women, a reading dataset of 7060 cases was randomly allocated for independent blinded review of (a) 2D mammography images, (b) 2D mammography plus DBT images, and (c) synthetic 2D mammography plus DBT images. Reviewers had no access to results of previous examinations. Overall sensitivities and specificities were calculated for younger women and those with dense breasts. Results Overall sensitivity was 87% for 2D mammography, 89% for 2D mammography plus DBT, and 88% for synthetic 2D mammography plus DBT. The addition of DBT was associated with a 34% increase in the odds of depicting cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 1.34, P = .06); however, this level did not achieve significance. For patients aged 50\u201359 years old, sensitivity was significantly higher (P = .01) for 2D mammography plus DBT than it was for 2D mammography. For those with breast density of 50% or more, sensitivity was 86% for 2D mammography compared with 93% for 2D mammography plus DBT (P = .03). Specificity was 57% for 2D mammography, 70% for 2D mammography plus DBT, and 72% for synthetic 2D mammography plusmDBT. Specificity was significantly higher than 2D mammography (P < .001in both cases) and was observed for all subgroups (P < .001 for all cases). Conclusion The addition of DBT increased the sensitivity of 2D mammography in patients with dense breasts and the specificity of 2D mammography for all subgroups. The use of synthetic 2D DBT demonstrated performance similar to that of standard 2D mammography with DBT. DBT is of potential benefit to screening programs, particularly in younger women with dense breasts. \u00a9 RSNA, 2015",
        "History A 61-year-old woman with well-controlled diabetes presented with a 10-year history of hypertension, stifling sensation, and flushing. Her body mass index was 19.1 kg/m(2) (normal range, 18.5-25.0 kg/m(2)). She was being followed up for mild hypercalcemia (calcium level, 10.8 mg/dL [2.7 mmol/L]) (normal range, 8.5-10.5 mg/dL [2.12-2.62 mmol/L]) by the endocrinologist (S.J.M.), who decided to perform a technetium 99m sestamibi ((99m)Tc MIBI) parathyroid scan. The test showed an abnormal tracer deposit in the region of the clavicle and sternum; thus, unenhanced thoracic computed tomography (CT) was performed. No mass was seen in the region of abnormality. In light of these findings, the patient underwent contrast material-enhanced (120 mL of iopromide, Ultravist 300; Schering, Berlin, Germany) thoracic abdominopelvic CT. There was no history of underlying malignancy, and the complete blood counts were normal. The axial and appendicular skeleton showed no sign of lesions.",
        "To assess whether a structural disconnection between the cerebellum and the cerebral hemispheres contributes to cerebellar and brainstem symptoms in multiple sclerosis (MS).This study was approved by the local ethics committee, and written informed consent was obtained from each participant. Brain T2 lesion load, cerebellar white matter and gray matter volumes, and tract-specific measures of the middle and superior cerebellar peduncles were derived from 172 patients with MS and 46 control subjects. Predictors of clinical impairment, which was determined at ambulation and with cerebellar and brainstem functional system scores, were identified by using random forest analysis.Of the 172 patients, 112 (65%) had middle cerebellar peduncle T2 lesions and 74 (43%) had superior cerebellar peduncle T2 lesions. T2 lesions in the middle and superior cerebellar peduncles were more common in clinically impaired patients than in unimpaired patients (P = .05 to <.0001). Most conventional magnetic resonance imaging metrics were more abnormal in impaired patients than in unimpaired patients (P = .03 to <.0001). Except for axial diffusivity, diffusivity abnormalities of the middle and superior cerebellar peduncles were more severe in clinically impaired patients than in unimpaired patients (P = .04 to <.0001). A minimal overlap was found between diffusivity abnormalities and T2 lesions. Compared with volumetric measures of T2 lesions or cerebellar atrophy, diffusivity measures of middle or superior cerebellar peduncle damage enabled better differentiation between clinically impaired and unimpaired patients (C statistics: 61%-70%).The assessment of middle and superior cerebellar peduncle damage contributes to the explanation of cerebellar and/or brainstem symptoms and ambulatory impairment in MS.",
        "Background Although favorable outcomes have been reported with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for limited hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the efficacy of this treatment for recurrent HCC has not been thoroughly investigated. Purpose To compare the long-term outcomes and analyze the prognostic factors for outcomes after RFA for initial HCC versus as a second-line treatment for recurrent HCC. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included 560 patients with solitary tumors 5 cm or smaller (263 initial HCCs, 297 -recurrent HCCs) who underwent percutaneous US-guided RFA from January 2005 to December 2016. Of 297 patients with -recurrent HCC, 134 had previously undergone hepatectomy, 128 had undergone transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), and 35 had undergone local ablation therapy. Overall survival (OS) between initial HCC and recurrent HCC was compared before and after propensity score matching. Prognostic factors for all patients were analyzed with the log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards model. Results A total of 560 patients (mean age, 60 years \u00b1 12 [standard deviation]; 441 men) were evaluated. Before matching, the OS rates at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years were 92.6%, 73.9%, 59.3%, and 39.6%, respectively, in patients with recurrent HCC and 92.8%, 75.4%, 63.3%, and 44.7% in patients with initial HCC (P = .27). After matching, the OS rates at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years were 94.8%, 75.7%, 61.6%, and 47.3% in the initial HCC group and 91.9%, 71.2%, 58.7%, and 45.2% in the recurrent HCC group (P = .32). Among patients with recurrent HCC, no significant difference in mean OS was noted for local recurrence versus distant recurrence (81.6 months \u00b1 5.1 vs 83.8 months \u00b1 6.6, P = .82) or previous treatment modality (82.0 months \u00b1 7.3 in the resection group, 82.7 months \u00b1 5.3 in the TACE group, and 79.3 months \u00b1 10.8 in the local ablation group; P = .83). Local tumor progression after previous local ablation (10 of 35 [28.6%]) was higher than that after previous hepatectomy (15 of 134 [11.2%], P = .04). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that tumor size (hazard ratio, 1.58; 95% CI: 1.06, 2.36; P = .02), portal hypertension (hazard ratio, 1.52; 95% CI: 1.03, 2.26; P = .04), Child-Pugh class (hazard ratio, 2.01; 95% CI: 1.02, 3.96; P = .045), and serum \u03b1-fetoprotein level (hazard ratio, 1.62; 95% CI: 1.10, 2.39; P = .01) were independent predictive factors for recurrent HCC outcomes. Conclusion Radiofrequency ablation provides similar long-term survival for solitary hepatocellular carcinoma of 5 cm or less, regardless of whether treatment is initial or salvage therapy. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To develop and evaluate an examination consisting of magnetic resonance (MR) fingerprinting\u2013based T1, T2, and standard apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping for multiparametric characterization of prostate disease. Materials and Methods This institutional review board\u2013approved, HIPAA-compliant retrospective study of prospectively collected data included 140 patients suspected of having prostate cancer. T1 and T2 mapping was performed with fast imaging with steady-state precession\u2013based MR fingerprinting with ADC mapping. Regions of interest were drawn by two independent readers in peripheral zone lesions and normal-appearing peripheral zone (NPZ) tissue identified on clinical images. T1, T2, and ADC were recorded for each region. Histopathologic correlation was based on systematic transrectal biopsy or cognitively targeted biopsy results, if available. Generalized estimating equations logistic regression was used to assess T1, T2, and ADC in the differentiation of (a) cancer versus NPZ, (b) cancer versus prostatitis, (c) prostatitis versus NPZ, and (d) high- or intermediate-grade tumors versus low-grade tumors. Analysis was performed for all lesions and repeated in a targeted biopsy subset. Discriminating ability was evaluated by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results In this study, 109 lesions were analyzed, including 39 with cognitively targeted sampling. T1, T2, and ADC from cancer (mean, 1628 msec \u00b1 344, 73 msec \u00b1 27, and 0.773 \u00d7 10\u22123 mm2/sec \u00b1 0.331, respectively) were significantly lower than those from NPZ (mean, 2247 msec \u00b1 450, 169 msec \u00b1 61, and 1.711 \u00d7 10\u22123 mm2/sec \u00b1 0.269) (P < .0001 for each) and together produced the best separation between these groups (AUC = 0.99). ADC and T2 together produced the highest AUC of 0.83 for separating high- or intermediate-grade tumors from low-grade cancers. T1, T2, and ADC in prostatitis (mean, 1707 msec \u00b1 377, 79 msec \u00b1 37, and 0.911 \u00d7 10\u22123 mm2/sec \u00b1 0.239) were significantly lower than those in NPZ (P < .0005 for each). Interreader agreement was excellent, with an intraclass correlation coefficient greater than 0.75 for both T1 and T2 measurements. Conclusion This study describes the development of a rapid MR fingerprinting\u2013 and diffusion-based examination for quantitative characterization of prostatic tissue. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Background CT of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 disease depicts the extent of lung involvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Purpose To determine the value of quantification of the well-aerated lung (WAL) obtained at admission chest CT to determine prognosis in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Materials and Methods Imaging of patients admitted at the emergency department between February 17 and March 10, 2020 who underwent chest CT were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with negative results of reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at nasal-pharyngeal swabbing, negative chest CT findings, and incomplete clinical data were excluded. CT images were analyzed for quantification of WAL visually (%V-WAL), with open-source software (%S-WAL), and with absolute volume (VOL-WAL). Clinical parameters included patient characteristics, comorbidities, symptom type and duration, oxygen saturation, and laboratory values. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship between clinical parameters and CT metrics versus patient outcome (intensive care unit [ICU] admission or death vs no ICU admission or death). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated to determine model performance. Results The study included 236 patients (59 of 123 [25%] were female; median age, 68 years). A %V-WAL less than 73% (odds ratio [OR], 5.4; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.7, 10.8; P < .001), %S-WAL less than 71% (OR, 3.8; 95% CI: 1.9, 7.5; P < .001), and VOL-WAL less than 2.9 L (OR, 2.6; 95% CI: 1.2, 5.8; P < .01) were predictors of ICU admission or death. In comparison with clinical models containing only clinical parameters (AUC = 0.83), all three quantitative models showed better diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.86 for all models). The models containing %V-WAL less than 73% and VOL-WAL less than 2.9 L were superior in terms of performance as compared with the models containing only clinical parameters (P = .04 for both models). Conclusion In patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia, visual or software quantification of the extent of CT lung abnormality were predictors of intensive care unit admission or death. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To assess the diagnostic accuracy, image quality, and radiation dose of an iterative reconstruction algorithm compared with a filtered back projection (FBP) algorithm for abdominal computed tomography (CT) at different tube voltages. Materials and Methods A custom liver phantom with 45 simulated hypovascular liver tumors (diameters of 5, 10, and 15 mm; tumor-to-liver contrast of 10, 25, and 50 HU) was placed in a cylindrical water container that mimicked an intermediate-sized patient. The phantom was scanned at 120, 100, and 80 kVp. The CT data sets were reconstructed with FBP and iterative reconstruction. The image noise was measured, and the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the tumors was calculated. The radiation dose was assessed with the volume CT dose index. Tumor detection was independently performed by three radiologists. Statistical analysis included analysis of variance. Results Compared with the FBP data set at 120 kVp, the iterative reconstruction data set collected at 100 kVp demonstrated significantly lower mean image noise (20.9 and 16.7 HU, respectively; P < .001) and greater mean CNRs for the simulated tumors (P < .001). The iterative reconstruction data set collected at 120 kVp yielded the highest sensitivity for tumor detection, while the FBP data set at 80 kVp yielded the lowest. The sensitivity for the iterative reconstruction data set at 100 kVp was comparable with that for the FBP data set at 120 kVp (79.3% and 74.9%, respectively; P > .99). The volume CT dose index decreased by 39.8% between the 120-kVp protocol and the 100-kVp protocol and by 70.3% between the 120-kVp protocol and the 80-kVp protocol. Conclusion Results of this phantom study suggest that a 100-kVp abdominal CT protocol with an iterative reconstruction algorithm for simulated intermediate-sized patients increases the image quality and maintains the diagnostic accuracy at a reduced radiation dose when compared with a 120-kVp protocol with an FBP algorithm. \u00a9 RSNA, 2011 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.11102217/-/DC1",
        "Background Neurological complications in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been described, but the understanding of their pathophysiology and neuroanatomical correlates remains limited. Purpose To report on the frequency and type of neuroradiological findings in COVID-19. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, all consecutive adult hospitalized patients with PCR-positivity for SARS-CoV-2, undergoing neuroimaging at Karolinska University Hospital between March 2 and May 24, 2020, were included. All examinations were systematically re-evaluated by 12 readers. Summary descriptive statistics were calculated. Results 185 patients with COVID-19 (62\u00b114 years, 138 men) underwent neuroimaging. In total, 222 brain CT, 47 brain MRI and 7 spinal MRI scans were performed. Intra-axial susceptibility abnormalities were the most common finding (29 of 39 [74%, 95%-CI 58-87%]) in patients with brain MRI, often with an ovoid shape suggestive of microvascular pathology, and with a predilection to corpus callosum (23 of 39, [59%, 95%-CI 42-74%]) and juxtacortical areas (14 of 39, [36%, 95% CI 21-53%]). Ischemic and macrohemorrhagic manifestations were also seen, but vascular imaging did not reveal overt abnormalities. Dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion MRI in 19 patients did not reveal consistent asymmetries between hemispheres or regions. Many patients (18 of 41 [44%, 95%-CI 28-60%]) had leukoencephalopathy and one patient had a cytotoxic lesion of the corpus callosum. Other findings included olfactory bulb signal abnormalities (7 of 37, 19%), prominent optic nerve subarachnoid spaces (20 of 36, 56%), and enhancement of the parenchyma (3 of 20, 15%), leptomeninges (3 of 20, 15%), cranial nerves (2 of 20, 10%), and spinal nerves (2 of 4, 50%). At MRI follow-up, regression of leukoencephalopathy and progressive leptomeningeal enhancement was observed in one patient respectively, suggestive of dynamic processes. Conclusion Patients with COVID-19 had a wide spectrum of vascular and inflammatory involvement of both the central and peripheral nervous system.",
        "Purpose To retrospectively assess whether there is an association between screening mammography and the use of a variety of preventive services in women who are enrolled in Medicare. Materials and Methods U.S. Medicare claims from 2010 to 2014 Research Identifiable Files were reviewed to retrospectively identify a group of women who underwent screening mammography and a control group without screening mammography in 2012. The screened group was divided into positive versus negative results at screening, and the positive subgroup was divided into false-positive and true-positive findings. Multivariate logistic regression models and inverse probability of treatment weighting were used to examine the relationship between screening status and the probabilities of undergoing Papanicolaou test, bone mass measurement, or influenza vaccination in the following 2 years. Results The cohort consisted of 555 705 patients, of whom 185 625 (33.4%) underwent mammography. After adjusting for patient demographics, comorbidities, geographic covariates, and baseline preventive care, women who underwent index screening mammography (with either positive or negative results) were more likely than unscreened women to later undergo Papanicolaou test (odds ratio [OR], 1.49; 95% confidence interval: 1.40, 1.58), bone mass measurement (OR, 1.70; 95% confidence interval: 1.63, 1.78), and influenza vaccine (OR, 1.45; 95% confidence interval: 1.37, 1.53). In women who had not undergone these preventive measures in the 2 years before screening mammography, use of these three services after false-positive findings at screening was no different than after true-negative findings at screening. Conclusion In beneficiaries of U.S. Medicare, use of screening mammography was associated with higher likelihood of adherence to other preventive guidelines, without a negative association between false-positive results and cervical cancer screening.",
        "Purpose To determine the prevalence of interstitial lung abnormalities (ILAs) at initial computed tomography (CT) examination and the rate of progression of ILAs on 2-year follow-up CT images in a National Lung Screening Trial population studied at a single site. Materials and Methods The study was approved by the institutional review board and informed consent was obtained from all participants. Image review for this study was HIPAA compliant. We reviewed the CT images of 884 cigarette smokers who underwent low-dose CT at a single site in the National Lung Screening Trial. CT findings were categorized as having no evidence of ILA, equivocal for ILA, or ILA. We categorized the type of ILA as nonfibrotic (ground-glass opacity, consolidation, mosaic attenuation), or fibrotic (ground glass with reticular pattern, reticular pattern, honeycombing). We evaluated the temporal change of the CT findings (no change, improvement, or progression) of ILA at 2-year follow-up. A \u03c72 with Fisher exact test or unpaired t test was used to determine whether smoking parameters were associated with progression of ILA at 2-year follow-up CT. Results The prevalence of ILA was 9.7% (86 of 884 participants; 95% confidence interval: 7.9%, 11.9%), with a further 11.5% (102 of 884 participants) who had findings equivocal for ILA. The pattern was fibrotic in 19 (2.1%), nonfibrotic in 52 (5.9%), and mixed fibrotic and nonfibrotic in 15 (1.7%) of the 86 participants with ILA. The percentage of current smokers (P = .001) and mean number of cigarette pack-years (P = .001) were significantly higher in those with ILA than those without. At 2-year follow-up of those with ILA (n = 79), findings of nonfibrotic ILA improved in 49% of cases and progressed in 11%. Fibrotic ILA improved in 0% and progressed in 37% of cases. Conclusion ILA is common in cigarette smokers. Nonfibrotic ILA improved in about 50% of cases, and fibrotic ILA progressed in about 37%. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "To compare the low-contrast detectability and image quality of computed tomography (CT) at different radiation dose levels reconstructed with iterative reconstruction (IR) and filtered back projection (FBP).A custom liver phantom with 12 simulated hypoattenuating tumors (diameters of 5, 10, 15, and 20 mm; tumor-to-liver contrast values of -10, -20, and -40 HU) was designed. The phantom was scanned with a standard abdominal CT protocol with a volume CT dose index of 21.6 mGy (equivalent 100% dose) and four low-dose protocols (20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% of the standard protocol dose). CT data sets were reconstructed with IR and FBP. Image noise was measured, and the tumors' contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were calculated. Tumor detection was independently assessed by three radiologists who were blinded to the CT technique used. A total of 840 simulated tumors were presented to the radiologists. Statistical analyses included analysis of variance.IR yielded an image noise reduction of 43.9%-63.9% and a CNR increase of 74.1%-180% compared with FBP at the same dose level (P < .001). The overall sensitivity for tumor detection was 64.7%-85.3% for IR and 66.3%-85.7% for FBP at the 20%-100% doses, respectively. There was no significant difference in the sensitivity for tumor detection between IR and FBP at the same dose level (P = .99). The sensitivity of the protocol at the 20% dose with FBP and IR was significantly lower than that of the protocol at the 100% dose with FBP and IR (P = .019).As the radiation dose at CT decreases, the IR algorithm does not preserve the low-contrast detectability.http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.13122349/-/DC1.",
        "To identify computed tomographic (CT) coronary indexes independently associated with a fractional flow reserve (FFR) of 0.8 or less, to derive a score that combines CT indexes most predictive of an FFR of 0.8 or less, and to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the score in predicting an FFR of 0.8 or less.This retrospective study had institutional review board approval and waiver of the need to obtain informed consent. Consecutive patients who underwent CT coronary angiography and FFR assessment with one or more discrete lesion(s) of intermediate (30%-70%) severity at CT were included. Quantitative CT measurements were performed by using dedicated software. The CT indexes evaluated included the following: plaque burden, minimal luminal area and diameter, stenosis diameter, area of stenosis, lesion length, remodeling index, plaque morphology, calcification severity, and the Alberta Provincial Project for Outcome Assessment in Coronary Heart Disease (APPROACH) score, which approximates the size of the myocardium subtended by a lesion. By using covariates independently associated with an FFR of 0.8 or less, a score was determined on the basis of modified Akaike information criteria, and the C statistics of individual and combined indexes were compared.Eighty-five patients (mean age, 64.2 years; range, 48-88 years; 65.9% men; 124 lesions; 38 lesions with an FFR \u2264 0.8) were included. Area of stenosis, lesion length, and APPROACH score were the strongest predictors of an FFR of 0.8 or less and were used to derive the ASLA score. The optimism-adjusted Harrell C statistic for the combined score was 0.82, which was superior to that for area of stenosis (0.74), lesion length (0.75), and the APPROACH score (0.71) (P < .001 for trend). The corresponding incremental discrimination improvement indexes were 0.17, 0.11, and 0.19, respectively (P < .001 for all), suggesting that the score improves reclassification compared with any one angiographic index. The average time required for score derivation was 102.6 seconds.The ASLA score, which accounts for CT-derived area of stenosis, lesion length, and APPROACH score, may conveniently improve the prediction, beyond individual indexes, of functionally significant intermediate coronary lesions.",
        "Purpose To identify the reproducible and nonredundant radiomics features (RFs) for computed tomography (CT). Materials and Methods Two phantoms were used to test RF reproducibility by using test-retest analysis, by changing the CT acquisition parameters (hereafter, intra-CT analysis), and by comparing five different scanners with the same CT parameters (hereafter, inter-CT analysis). Reproducible RFs were selected by using the concordance correlation coefficient (as a measure of the agreement between variables) and the coefficient of variation (defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean). Redundant features were grouped by using hierarchical cluster analysis. Results A total of 177 RFs including intensity, shape, and texture features were evaluated. The test-retest analysis showed that 91% (161 of 177) of the RFs were reproducible according to concordance correlation coefficient. Reproducibility of intra-CT RFs, based on coefficient of variation, ranged from 89.3% (151 of 177) to 43.1% (76 of 177) where the pitch factor and the reconstruction kernel were modified, respectively. Reproducibility of inter-CT RFs, based on coefficient of variation, also showed large material differences, from 85.3% (151 of 177; wood) to only 15.8% (28 of 177; polyurethane). Ten clusters were identified after the hierarchical cluster analysis and one RF per cluster was chosen as representative. Conclusion Many RFs were redundant and nonreproducible. If all the CT parameters are fixed except field of view, tube voltage, and milliamperage, then the information provided by the analyzed RFs can be summarized in only 10 RFs (each representing a cluster) because of redundancy.",
        "To assess the performance of an artificial neural network in the evaluation of fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the liver, compared with the results of expert interpretation of abdominal liver magnetic resonance (MR) images.The study was approved by the institutional human research committee and was HIPAA compliant, with waiver of informed consent. Digital data from positron emission tomographic (PET)/computed tomographic (CT) examinations, along with patient demographics, were obtained from 98 consecutive patients who underwent both whole-body PET/CT examinations and liver MR imaging examinations within 2 months. Interpretations of the scans from PET/CT examinations by trained neural networks were cross-classified with expert interpretations of the findings on images from MR examinations for intrahepatic benignity or malignancy. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were obtained for the designed networks. The significance of the difference between neural network ROC curves and the ROC curves detailing the performance of two expert blinded observers in the interpretation of liver FDG uptake was determined.A neural network incorporating lesion data demonstrated an ROC curve with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.905 (standard error, 0.0370). A network independent of lesion data demonstrated an ROC curve with an AUC of 0.896 (standard error, 0.0386). These results compare favorably with results of expert blinded observers 1 and 2 who demonstrated ROCs with AUCs of 0.786 (standard error, 0.0522) and 0.796 (standard error, 0.0514), respectively. Following unblinding to network data, the AUCs for readers 1 and 2 improved to 0.924 (standard error, 0.0335) and 0.881 (standard error, 0.0409), respectively.Computers running artificial neural networks employing PET/CT scan data are sensitive and specific in the designation of the presence of intrahepatic malignancy, with comparison with interpretation by expert observers. When used in conjunction with human expertise, network data improve accuracy of the human interpreter.",
        "History A 57-year-old woman was referred to our institute in 2010 by a neurologist for a follow-up brain magnetic resonance (MR) examination. She had not experienced any acute change in symptoms, but unspecific unilateral hyperintensities in her left cerebral hemisphere had been noted at a previous MR examination in 2004. Since 2001, she had been repeatedly seen in neurology departments for recurrent episodes of clumsiness of her left hand and frequent headaches. Her other medical history was unremarkable, as were the findings of a neurologic examination. She was not born prematurely, she was not hypertensive, and she had not shown signs or symptoms suggestive of immune incompetence or autoimmune disease. There was no history of meningitis or encephalitis. A source for embolic foci could not be established. Serology indicated no previous cysticercosis infection. Her laboratory test results were normal. Since no other underlying cause had been previously considered, a radiologist from another institute postulated that her left hemispheric hyperintensities could be seen as a rudimentary expression of tuberous sclerosis lacking the classic clinical triad. The MR examination in our institution was performed to rule out progression. The resulting images were compared with those obtained in 2004.",
        "Purpose To establish an image-based M1 category subdivision system for personalized prognosis prediction and treatment planning in patients with metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Materials and Methods A total of 1172 patients with metachronous metastasic NPC were retrospectively enrolled (the dataset is from Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center for derivation, and the combined datasets are from Guangzhou Medical University Cancer Center and the Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University for validation). The Ethics Committee of the three centers approved this study. A general subdivision system of the M1 category was established on the basis of the most influential metastatic features for overall survival (OS). The following multilevel subdivision system for precise subdivision of the M1 category was designed: M [number of locations]-Location [number of lesions], with B indicating bone, L indicating the lung, H indicating the liver, and N indicating a node. The correlation of the M1 subdivisions with OS was determined with Cox regression. The best treatment response was assessed with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 guidelines and modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria. Results Multivariate analysis in the derivation cohort showed that the number of metastatic lesions (multiple or single), the number of metastatic locations (multiple or single), liver involvement, and bone involvement were independent prognostic factors for OS. In general, subdividing the cohort by the number of metastatic lesions and the number of metastatic locations resulted in three subcategories of differential OS: M1a, a single lesion in a single organ or location; M1b, multiple lesions in a single organ or location; and M1c, metastases in multiple locations (for M1b vs M1a, hazard ratio [HR] = 2.28, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.71, 3.05; for M1c vs M1a, HR = 3.65, 95% CI: 2.75, 4.85); these subdivisions were externally validated. The multilevel subdivision system could be further used to discriminate among subgroups of differential OS under the M1b subcategory. Findings from analysis of multilevel subgroups suggested that patients with a single metastatic lesion (M1-B1, M1-L1, M1-H1, M1-N1) or two lesions in the liver only (M1-H2) had high rates of complete response (CR) or complete surgical resection (CSR) and 3-year OS after treatment (CR plus CSR rates >30%, and 3-year OS rates >50%); there were high 3-year OS rates (>50%) in patients with stage M1-B2, M1-L2, or M1-H3 disease but relatively low rates of CR or CSR. Conclusion Use of the multilevel M1 subdivision system in patients with NPC could facilitate more precise prognosis prediction and better identification of patients who will respond well to treatment than the conventional subdivision strategy.

        "Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to garner substantial interest in medical imaging. The potential applications are vast and include the entirety of the medical imaging life cycle from image creation to diagnosis to outcome prediction. The chief obstacles to development and clinical implementation of AI algorithms include availability of sufficiently large, curated, and representative training data that includes expert labeling (eg, annotations). Current supervised AI methods require a curation process for data to optimally train, validate, and test algorithms. Currently, most research groups and industry have limited data access based on small sample sizes from small geographic areas. In addition, the preparation of data is a costly and time-intensive process, the results of which are algorithms with limited utility and poor generalization. In this article, the authors describe fundamental steps for preparing medical imaging data in AI algorithm development, explain current limitations to data curation, and explore new approaches to address the problem of data availability. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020",
        "Purpose To assess cerebral microbleed (CMB) prevalence in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and associations with clinical outcomes. Materials and Methods CMBs are associated with aging and neurodegenerative disorders. The prevalence of CMBs has not previously been well established. In this study, 445 patients with MS (266 with relapsing-remitting MS, 138 with secondary progressive MS, and 41 with primary progressive MS), 45 patients with CIS, 51 patients with other neurological diseases, and 177 healthy control subjects (HCs) underwent 3-T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and clinical examinations. A subset of 168 patients with MS and 50 HCs underwent neuropsychological testing. Number of CMBs was assessed on susceptibility-weighted minimum intensity projections by using the Microbleed Anatomic Rating Scale; volume was calculated by using quantitative susceptibility maps. Differences between groups were analyzed with the \u03c72 test, Fisher exact test, Student t test, and analysis of variance; associations of CMBs with clinical and other MR imaging outcomes were explored with correlation and regression analyses. Because CMB frequency increases with age, prevalence was investigated in participants at least 50 years of age and younger than 50 years. Results Significantly more patients with MS than HCs had CMBs (19.8% vs 7.4%, respectively; P = .01) in the group at least 50 years old. A trend toward greater presence of CMBs was found in patients with MS (P = .016) and patients with CIS who were younger than 50 years (P = .039) compared with HCs. In regression analysis adjusted for age, hypertension, and normalized brain volume, increased number of CMBs was significantly associated with increased physical disability in the MS population (R2 = 0.23, P < .0001). In correlation analysis, increased number of CMBs was significantly associated with deteriorated auditory and verbal learning and memory (P = .006) and visual information processing speed trends (P = .049) in patients with MS. Conclusion Monitoring CMBs may be relevant in patients with MS and CIS at higher risk for developing cognitive and physical disability. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Invasive coronary angiography (ICA) with measurement of fractional flow reserve (FFR) by means of a pressure wire technique is the established reference standard for the functional assessment of coronary artery disease (CAD) ( 1 , 2 ). Coronary computed tomographic (CT) angiography has emerged as a noninvasive method for direct assessment of CAD and plaque characterization with high diagnostic accuracy compared with ICA ( 3 , 4 ). However, the solely anatomic assessment provided with both coronary CT angiography and ICA has poor discriminatory power for ischemia-inducing lesions. FFR derived from standard coronary CT angiography (FFRCT) data sets by using any of several advanced computational analytic approaches enables combined anatomic and hemodynamic assessment of a coronary lesion by a single noninvasive test. Current technical approaches to the calculation of FFRCT include algorithms based on full- and reduced-order computational fluid dynamic modeling, as well as artificial intelligence deep machine learning ( 5 , 6 ). A growing body of evidence has validated the diagnostic accuracy of FFRCT techniques compared with invasive FFR. Improved therapeutic guidance has been demonstrated, showing the potential of FFRCT to streamline and rationalize the care of patients suspected of having CAD and improve outcomes while reducing overall health care costs ( 7 , 8 ). The purpose of this review is to describe the scientific principles, clinical validation, and implementation of various FFRCT approaches, their precursors, and related imaging tests. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017.",
        "Background Portable, low-field-strength (0.064-T) MRI has the potential to transform neuroimaging but is limited by low spatial resolution and low signal-to-noise ratio. Purpose To implement a machine learning super-resolution algorithm that synthesizes higher spatial resolution images (1-mm isotropic) from lower resolution T1-weighted and T2-weighted portable brain MRI scans, making them amenable to automated quantitative morphometry. Materials and Methods An external high-field-strength MRI data set (1-mm isotropic scans from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies data set) and segmentations for 39 regions of interest (ROIs) in the brain were used to train a super-resolution convolutional neural network (CNN). Secondary analysis of an internal test set of 24 paired low- and high-field-strength clinical MRI scans in participants with neurologic symptoms was performed. These were part of a prospective observational study (August 2020 to December 2021) at Massachusetts General Hospital (exclusion criteria: inability to lay flat, body habitus preventing low-field-strength MRI, presence of MRI contraindications). Three well-established automated segmentation tools were applied to three sets of scans: high-field-strength (1.5\u20133 T, reference standard), low-field-strength (0.064 T), and synthetic high-field-strength images generated from the low-field-strength data with the CNN. Statistical significance of correlations was assessed with Student t tests. Correlation coefficients were compared with Steiger Z tests. Results Eleven participants (mean age, 50 years \u00b1 14; seven men) had full cerebrum coverage in the images without motion artifacts or large stroke lesion with distortion from mass effect. Direct segmentation of low-field-strength MRI yielded nonsignificant correlations with volumetric measurements from high field strength for most ROIs (P > .05). Correlations largely improved when segmenting the synthetic images: P values were less than .05 for all ROIs (eg, for the hippocampus [r = 0.85; P < .001], thalamus [r = 0.84; P = .001], and whole cerebrum [r = 0.92; P < .001]). Deviations from the model (z score maps) visually correlated with pathologic abnormalities. Conclusion This work demonstrated proof-of-principle augmentation of portable MRI with a machine learning super-resolution algorithm, which yielded highly correlated brain morphometric measurements to real higher resolution images. \u00a9 RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Purpose To determine if heat stress and hepatic laser thermal ablation induce hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) growth and to identify growth factors induced by heat stress. Materials and Methods Non-heat-stressed HCC cells were cocultured with HCC cells or hepatocytes that were heat stressed at 37\u00b0C (physiologic), 45\u00b0C (moderate), or 50\u00b0C (severe) for 10 minutes and proliferation monitored with bioluminescence imaging for up to 6 days after heat stress (three experiments). Rats bearing orthotopic N1S1 HCC were randomly assigned to undergo immediate sham or laser thermal (3 W for 60 or 90 seconds; hereafter, 3W\u00d760s and 3W\u00d790s, respectively) ablation of the median (local) or left (distant) hepatic lobe, and tumor growth was monitored with magnetic resonance imaging for up to 18 days after ablation (six or more rats per group). Experiments were repeated with rats randomly assigned to receive either the adjuvant phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor (NVP-BEZ235) or the vehicle control. Heat-stressed HCC cells and hepatocytes were analyzed by using microarray or quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis for growth factor expression (three or more experiments). Groups were compared by using one- or two-way analysis of variance, and post hoc pairwise comparison was performed with the Dunnett test. Results There were more non-heat-stressed HCC cells when cells were cocultured with cells subjected to moderate but not physiologic or severe heat stress (P < .001 for both). Local intrahepatic N1S1 tumors were larger at day 18 in the 3W\u00d760s (mean, 3102 mm3 \u00b1 463 [standard error]; P = .004) and 3W\u00d790s (mean, 3538 mm3 \u00b1 667; P < .001) groups than in the sham group (mean, 1363 mm3 \u00b1 361) but not in distant intrahepatic tumors (P = .31). Adjuvant BEZ235 resulted in smaller N1S1 tumors in the BEZ235 and laser thermal ablation group than in the vehicle control and laser thermal ablation group (mean, 1731 mm3 \u00b1 1457 vs 3844 mm3 \u00b1 2400, P < .001). Moderate heat stress induced expression of growth factors in HCC cells and hepatocytes, including heparin-binding growth factor, fibroblast growth factor 21, and nerve growth factor (range, 2.9-66.9-fold; P < .05). Conclusion Moderate heat stress and laser thermal ablation induce hepatocellular carcinoma growth, which is prevented with adjuvant PI3K/mTOR/protein kinase B inhibition.",
        "Purpose To establish performance benchmarks for modern screening digital mammography and assess performance trends over time in U.S. community practice. Materials and Methods This HIPAA-compliant, institutional review board\u2013approved study measured the performance of digital screening mammography interpreted by 359 radiologists across 95 facilities in six Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) registries. The study included 1 682 504 digital screening mammograms performed between 2007 and 2013 in 792 808 women. Performance measures were calculated according to the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System, 5th edition, and were compared with published benchmarks by the BCSC, the National Mammography Database, and performance recommendations by expert opinion. Benchmarks were derived from the distribution of performance metrics across radiologists and were presented as 50th (median), 10th, 25th, 75th, and 90th percentiles, with graphic presentations using smoothed curves. Results Mean screening performance measures were as follows: abnormal interpretation rate (AIR), 11.6 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.5, 11.6); cancers detected per 1000 screens, or cancer detection rate (CDR), 5.1 (95% CI: 5.0, 5.2); sensitivity, 86.9% (95% CI: 86.3%, 87.6%); specificity, 88.9% (95% CI: 88.8%, 88.9%); false-negative rate per 1000 screens, 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7, 0.8); positive predictive value (PPV) 1, 4.4% (95% CI: 4.3%, 4.5%); PPV2, 25.6% (95% CI: 25.1%, 26.1%); PPV3, 28.6% (95% CI: 28.0%, 29.3%); cancers stage 0 or 1, 76.9%; minimal cancers, 57.7%; and node-negative invasive cancers, 79.4%. Recommended CDRs were achieved by 92.1% of radiologists in community practice, and 97.1% achieved recommended ranges for sensitivity. Only 59.0% of radiologists achieved recommended AIRs, and only 63.0% achieved recommended levels of specificity.

        "Purpose The Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) Pediatric Bone Age Machine Learning Challenge was created to show an application of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging, promote collaboration to catalyze AI model creation, and identify innovators in medical imaging. Materials and Methods The goal of this challenge was to solicit individuals and teams to create an algorithm or model using ML techniques that would accurately determine skeletal age in a curated data set of pediatric hand radiographs. The primary evaluation measure was the mean absolute distance (MAD) in months, which was calculated as the mean of the absolute values of the difference between the model estimates and those of the reference standard, bone age. Results A data set consisting of 14 236 hand radiographs (12 611 training set, 1425 validation set, 200 test set) was made available to registered challenge participants. A total of 260 individuals or teams registered on the Challenge website. A total of 105 submissions were uploaded from 48 unique users during the training, validation, and test phases. Almost all methods used deep neural network techniques based on one or more convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The best five results based on MAD were 4.2, 4.4, 4.4, 4.5, and 4.5 months, respectively. Conclusion The RSNA Pediatric Bone Age Machine Learning Challenge showed how a coordinated approach to solving a medical imaging problem can be successfully conducted.

As part of her work-up, she underwent routine echocardiography that showed a normal heart but incidentally revealed multiple lesions in the liver. An outpatient CT scan was performed to characterize the liver lesions. The patient had emigrated to Canada from the Middle East several years earlier and had no medical history of note; in particular, there was no history of cancer or predisposing factors for chronic liver disease. The patient's clinical examination findings; laboratory test results, including complete blood count; and liver function test results were normal.",
        "To review the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings in eight patients who developed marrow lesions after undergoing physiotherapy with use of ultrasound diathermy.The authors retrospectively reviewed the medical charts and MR images of eight patients (six women and two men aged 22-69 years) who received ultrasound diathermy treatment for a variety of soft tissue injuries involving primarily the knee, shoulder, and wrist. All patients underwent MR imaging without the use of intravenous gadolinium-based contrast material. The institutional review board approved the study, and the requirement to obtain informed consent was waived.MR imaging of all patients revealed subcortical rim or arc lesions with low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images, without involvement of the deeper aspect of the bone marrow. The imaging features of the lesions were similar to those of focal osteonecrosis. Follow-up MR imaging performed in three patients approximately 2-3 months after cessation of ultrasound therapy revealed resolution of the bone lesions. Symptoms resolved in all patients.This study demonstrated that ultrasound diathermy may produce an osseous injury. The abnormality itself was usually mild and transient, with apparent full recovery after termination of therapy.",
        "The World Health Organization (WHO) undertook the development of a rapid guide on the use of chest imaging in the diagnosis and management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The rapid guide was developed over 2 months by using standard WHO processes, except for the use of \"rapid reviews\" and online meetings of the panel. The evidence review was supplemented by a survey of stakeholders regarding their views on the acceptability, feasibility, impact on equity, and resource use of the relevant chest imaging modalities (chest radiography, chest CT, and lung US). The guideline development group had broad expertise and country representation. The rapid guide includes three diagnosis recommendations and four management recommendations. The recommendations cover patients with confirmed or who are suspected of having COVID-19 with different levels of disease severity, throughout the care pathway from outpatient facility or hospital entry to home discharge. All recommendations are conditional and are based on low certainty evidence (",
        "To investigate the use of photoacoustic (PA) spectrum analysis (PASA) to identify microstructural changes corresponding to fat accumulation in mouse livers ex vivo and in situ.The laboratory animal protocol for this work was approved by the university committee on use and care of animals. Six mice with normal livers and six mice with fatty livers were examined ex vivo with a PA system at 1200 nm, and nine similar pairs of mice were examined at 532 nm. To explore the feasibility of this technique for future study in an in vivo mouse model, an additional pair of normal and fatty mouse livers was scanned in situ with an ultrasonographic (US) and PA dual-modality imaging system. The PA signals acquired were analyzed by using the proposed PASA method. Results of the groups were compared by using the Student t test.Prominent differences between the PASA parameters from the fatty and normal mouse livers were observed. The analysis of the PASA parameters from six normal and six fatty mouse livers indicates that there are differences of up to 5 standard deviations between the PASA parameters of the normal livers and those of the fatty livers at 1200 nm; for parameters from nine normal and nine fatty mouse livers at 532 nm, the differences were approximately 2 standard deviations (P < .05) for each PASA parameter.The results supported our hypothesis that the PASA allows quantitative identification of the microstructural changes that differentiate normal from fatty livers. Compared with that at 532 nm, PASA at 1200 nm is more reliable for fatty liver diagnosis. Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To determine if computed tomographic (CT) texture and histogram analysis measurements of the primary mass are independently associated with overall survival in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who were previously treated with cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and docetaxel (TPF) induction chemotherapy. Materials and Methods This institutional review board\u2013approved retrospective study included 72 patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who were treated with induction TPF chemotherapy in 2004\u20132010. CT texture and histogram analysis of the primary mass on the pretherapy CT images were performed by using TexRAD software before and after application of spatial filters at different anatomic scales ranging from fine detail to coarse features. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the association between overall survival and the baseline CT imaging measurements and clinical variables. Results Primary mass entropy and skewness measurements with multiple spatial filters were associated with overall survival. Multivariate Cox regression analysis incorporating clinical and imaging variables indicated that primary mass size (hazard ratio [HR], 1.58 for each 1-cm increase; P = .018), N stage (HR, 8.77 for N3 vs N0 or N1; P = .002; HR, 4.99 for N3 vs N2; P = .001), and primary mass entropy (HR, 2.10 for each 0.5-unit increase; P = .036) and skewness (HR, 3.67 for each 1.0-unit increase; P = .009) measurements with the 1.0 spatial filter were independently associated with overall survival. Conclusion Independent of tumor size, N stage, and other clinical variables, primary mass CT texture and histogram analysis parameters are associated with overall survival in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who were treated with induction TPF. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To report the incidence of cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT) in a prospective cohort of preterm infants with a gestational age of less than 29 weeks. Materials and Methods The local medical ethics review board approved this study, and written parental consent was obtained. Preterm infants with a gestational age of less than 29 weeks who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit were prospectively studied with cranial ultrasonography (US). The scanning protocol included visualization with color Doppler imaging of the superior sagittal sinus and transverse sinuses through the anterior (8.5-MHz probe) and mastoid (13-MHz probe) fontanelles. When feasible, magnetic resonance imaging was performed to confirm cranial US-diagnosed CSVT. The differences between preterm infants with and those without CSVT were analyzed by using Mann-Whitney tests for continuous variables and Fisher exact tests for categorical data. Results Cranial US was used to document CSVT in 11 of 249 preterm infants with a gestational age of less than 29 weeks. Transverse sinuses were most frequently affected (in all 11 patients with CSVT). All infants with CSVT were asymptomatic. Postnatal age at diagnosis ranged from 5 to 34 days. The mean gestational age was significantly lower in infants with CSVT (25.9 weeks vs 26.8 weeks, P = .038). Of the risk factors studied, only duration of mechanical ventilation was associated with CSVT; it was significantly longer in the CSVT group. Conclusion Systematic serial cranial US of infants with a gestational age of less than 29 weeks showed a remarkably high incidence of CSVT of 4.4%. Cranial US including color Doppler imaging with scans obtained through the mastoid fontanelle can depict CSVT at an early stage. Treatment of this possibly important condition needs attention. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "To prospectively assess the diagnostic performance of diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the detection of pelvic lymph node metastases in patients with prostate and/or bladder cancer staged as N0 with preoperative cross-sectional imaging.This study was approved by an independent ethics committee. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Patients with no enlarged lymph nodes on preoperative cross-sectional images who were scheduled for radical resection of the primary tumor and extended pelvic lymph node dissection were enrolled. All patients were examined with a 3-T MR unit, and examinations included conventional and DW MR imaging of the entire pelvis. Image analysis was performed by three independent readers blinded to any clinical information. Metastases were diagnosed on the basis of high signal intensity on high b value DW MR images and morphologic features (shape, border). Histopathologic examination served as the standard of reference. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated, and bias-corrected 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained with the bootstrap method. The Fleiss and Cohen \u03ba and median test were applied for statistical analyses.A total of 4846 lymph nodes were resected in 120 patients. Eighty-eight lymph node metastases were found in 33 of 120 patients (27.5%). Short-axis diameter of these metastases was less than or equal to 3 mm in 68, more than 3 mm to 5 mm in 13, more than 5 mm to 8 mm in five; and more than 8 mm in two. On a per-patient level, the three readers correctly detected metastases in 26 (79%; 95% CI: 64%, 91%), 21 (64%; 95% CI: 45%, 79%), and 25 (76%; 95% CI: 60%, 90%) of the 33 patients with metastases, with respective specificities of 85% (95% CI: 78%, 92%), 79% (95% CI: 70%, 88%), and 84% (95% CI: 76%, 92%). Analyzed according to hemipelvis, lymph node metastases were detected with histopathologic examination in 44 of 240 pelvic sides (18%); the three readers correctly detected these on DW MR images in 26 (59%; 95% CI: 45%, 73%), 19 (43%; 95% CI: 27%, 57%), and 28 (64%; 95% CI: 47%, 78%) of the 44 cases.DW MR imaging enables noninvasive detection of small lymph node metastases in normal-sized nodes in a substantial percentage of patients with prostate and bladder cancer diagnosed as N0 with conventional cross-sectional imaging techniques.",

There may be associated ileus and perforation leading to surgical emergency with high mortality.\r\nDiabetes mellitus is a debilitating disease that affects all systems in the body and Literature documents a higher incidence of complications associated with gallstone disease (GSD) in diabetics than in the non-diabetic population. No local document regarding the association between GS formation and DM is available. This study was therefore designed to determine the incidence of gallstones in diabetes mellitus, the effect of demographic and social factors on the formation of GS in diabetic patients. The study also evaluated the association between clinical symptoms and type of DM more prevalent with gallstone formation.Methodology:\r\n400 diabetic patients of aged between 15years and 82years, attending the Diabetic clinic at the University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan within a six month- period were examined for presence of gallstones using ultrasonography.Results:\r\nGS was found in 70 (17.5%) out of the 400 patients; 59 (51.92%) of these were above the age of 40 and in effect were of type II DM; with a male to female ratio\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof 3:4; BMI greater than 25kgm-2 were seen in 56 (48.3%) patients; smoking and alcohol intake were insignificantly implicated.Jaundice was recorded in 8 (11.4%) while abdominal pain was in 24 (34.3%) and 52 (74.3%) patients of those with GSD had had diabetes for more than 4years.Conclusion:\r\nIncidence of gallstone disease in diabetes mellitus is influenced significantly by age, BMI and duration of the disease, while the influence of gender, social factors and parity are not strong associated factors.",
        "To compare the antiquated x-ray system of Hoffmans and van Kleef (circa 1896) with modern x-ray equipment in terms of radiation dose, x-ray beam properties, image quality, and electrical parameters.The antiquated x-ray system consisted of a Ruhmkorff inductor, battery, and Crookes tube. The radiation dose rate, x-ray beam properties, and electrical characteristics of this system were determined. A modern computed radiography plate was used to compare images of a hand specimen obtained by using the antiquated system with images obtained by using the modern system.A peak voltage of 73 kV was obtained with an 8-V battery. With Crookes tube number 9, the half-value layer of the generated x-rays was 0.56 mm Al. Pinhole images showed that the x-rays originated from an extended area of the glass wall, causing image blurring. When measured on the skin of a hand specimen, the radiation dose of the antiquated system was about 10 times greater than that of the modern system for the same detector signal. The estimated skin dose was about 74 mGy for the antiquated system and 0.05 mGy for the modern system. The corresponding exposure times were 90 minutes and 21 msec.Radiation dose and exposure time of the antiquated system were greater than those of the modern system by about three and five orders of magnitude, respectively. Images of the hand specimen obtained with the antiquated system were severely blurred but were still awe inspiring, considering the simplicity of the system.http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.11101899/-/DC1.",
        "To retrospectively compare the detection and characterization of hepatic perfusion disorder (HPD) associated with focal liver lesions (FLLs) at contrast material-enhanced ultrasonography (US) by using contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) as the reference standard.The study was approved by the local institutional ethics committee, and informed consent was waived. Three hundred fifty patients (mean age, 50 years \u00b1 11 [standard deviation]; age range, 19-82 years; 168 women, 182 men) underwent contrast-enhanced US and contrast-enhanced CT between April 2008 and July 2010. Two independent readers reviewed contrast-enhanced US images for the detection and characterization of HPD. The largest lesion or the lesion best identified at contrast-enhanced US per patient was used for statistical analysis. Contrast-enhanced CT was used as the reference standard. Contrast-enhanced US and CT interreader agreement of diagnoses was assessed by using the weighted \u03ba coefficient, and influences of lesion size, enhancement covering rate, and liver cirrhosis were evaluated by using logistic regression analysis and the paired \u03c7(2) test. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy of contrast-enhanced US for HPD detection were calculated.Contrast-enhanced US results showed HPD features similar to those of CT imaging. CT depicted 50 HPDs in 350 patients, and contrast-enhanced US depicted 55 HPDs in 350 patients. The agreement for HPD diagnosis between US and CT was good (\u03ba = 0.749). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of contrast-enhanced US were 84.0%, 95.7%, 76.4%, 97.3%, and 0.945, respectively. Rapid enhancement coverage (P < .001) and lesion size (P = .002) were significant predictors of the occurrence of HPD. Liver cirrhosis did not have significant influence for HPD detection (P = .087). Image zooming, limited acoustic window, lesion diameter greater than 5 cm, attenuation, and blurred images were the main reasons for the false-positive diagnosis of HPD at contrast-enhanced US.The HPD in FLLs can reliably be detected with contrast-enhanced US, which correlated well with contrast-enhanced CT images.",

He denied any trauma to the site. At that time, physical examination demonstrated swelling in his right upper thigh. All other work-up, including complete blood count and chest radiography, yielded negative results. The initial diagnosis was lymphangioma of the thigh. He continued to experience worsening swelling in his right upper thigh with no other symptoms over the next year. He was referred to our facility, where he underwent US evaluation of the thigh lesion, an MRI scan encompassing the entire extent of his thigh lesion, and a CT scan of his abdomen and pelvis.",
        "Purpose To assess cancer detection rates, false-positive rates before arbitration, positive predictive values for women recalled after arbitration, and the type of cancers detected with use of digital mammography alone and combined with tomosynthesis in a large prospective screening trial. Materials and Methods A prospective, reader- and modality-balanced screening study of participants undergoing combined mammography plus tomosynthesis, the results of which were read independently by four different radiologists, is under way. The study was approved by a regional ethics committee, and all participants provided written informed consent. The authors performed a preplanned interim analysis of results from 12631 examinations interpreted by using mammography alone and mammography plus tomosynthesis from November 22, 2010, to December 31, 2011. Analyses were based on marginal log-linear models for binary data, accounting for correlated interpretations and adjusting for reader-specific performance levels by using a two-sided significance level of .0294. Results Detection rates, including those for invasive and in situ cancers, were 6.1 per 1000 examinations for mammography alone and 8.0 per 1000 examinations for mammography plus tomosynthesis (27% increase, adjusted for reader; P = .001). False-positive rates before arbitration were 61.1 per 1000 examinations with mammography alone and 53.1 per 1000 examinations with mammography plus tomosynthesis (15% decrease, adjusted for reader; P < .001). After arbitration, positive predictive values for recalled patients with cancers verified later were comparable (29.1% and 28.5%, respectively, with mammography alone and mammography plus tomosynthesis; P = .72). Twenty-five additional invasive cancers were detected with mammography plus tomosynthesis (40% increase, adjusted for reader; P < .001). The mean interpretation time was 45 seconds for mammography alone and 91 seconds for mammography plus tomosynthesis (P < .001). Conclusion The use of mammography plus tomosynthesis in a screening environment resulted in a significantly higher cancer detection rate and enabled the detection of more invasive cancers. \u00a9RSNA, 2013 Clinical trial registration no.

        "Purpose To evaluate the feasibility of using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) to visualize the in vivo recruitment of iron oxide\u2013labeled macrophages and indium 111 (111In)-labeled macrophages in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and to monitor disease activity. Materials and Methods This study had institutional animal care and use committee approval. Twenty-seven C57/B6 mice with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced IBD and control mice were included. Peritoneal macrophages were harvested from seven thioglycollate-treated mice and were labeled with superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles. Macrophage iron content was determined by using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. SPIO nanoparticle\u2013labeled macrophages (5 \u00d7 106) were intravenously administered. Mice with DSS-induced IBD (n = 8) and control mice (n = 6) were imaged with a 9.4-T MR imaging unit at 0, 5, and 24 hours after macrophage administration. Percentage normalized enhancement (NE) was calculated for the intestinal wall and liver 24 hours after injection. Six mice with IBD coinjected with SPIO nanoparticles and 111In oxine\u2013labeled macrophages were imaged with MR imaging and SPECT/CT after 24 hours. The pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of the implanted macrophages were determined. Correlation between percentage NE and IBD scores was calculated. Results Ex vivo mass spectrometry revealed strong SPIO nanoparticle uptake (7.4 pg iron per cell). R2* correlated with cell number (r = 0.9813, P < .05). Percentage NE correlated with both clinical (r = 0.924) and pathologic (r = 0.795) IBD score. Cell circulation half-life in the first and second phases was 0.32 hour and 10.2 hours, respectively. SPECT/CT showed that approximately 3% of the injected dose was present in the intestines 24 hours after injection; this was confirmed at MR imaging and histologic examination. Indium 111\u2013labeled cells were present in all tissue associated with the reticuloendothelial system or mononuclear phagocyte system at 24 hours. Conclusion SPIO nanoparticles and 111In-labeled macrophages could be observed in vivo at MR imaging and SPECT/CT in mice with IBD. Percentage NE at MR imaging correlates with disease activity. \u00a9 RSNA, 2014 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To assess the feasibility of multiplanar vascular navigation with a new magnetically assisted remote-controlled (MARC) catheter with real-time magnetic resonance (MR) imaging at 1.5 T and 3 T and to compare it with standard x-ray guidance in simulated endovascular catheterization procedures.A 1.6-mm-diameter custom clinical-grade microcatheter prototype with lithographed double-saddle coils at the distal tip was deflected with real-time MR imaging. Two inexperienced operators and two experienced operators catheterized anteroposterior (celiac, superior mesenteric, and inferior mesenteric arteries) and mediolateral (renal arteries) branch vessels in a cryogel abdominal aortic phantom. This was repeated with conventional x-ray fluoroscopy by using clinical catheters and guidewires. Mean procedure times and percentage success data were analyzed with linear mixed-effects regression.The MARC catheter tip was visible at 1.5 T and 3 T. Among inexperienced operators, MARC MR imaging guidance was not statistically different from x-ray guidance at 1.5 T (67% successful vessel selection turns with MR imaging vs 76% with x-ray guidance, P = .157) and at 3 T (75% successful turns with MR imaging vs 76% with x-ray guidance, P = .869). Experienced operators were more successful in catheterizing vessels with x-ray guidance (98% success within 60 seconds) than with 1.5-T (65%, P < .001) or 3-T (75%) MR imaging. Among inexperienced operators, mean procedure time was nearly equivalent by using MR imaging (31 seconds) and x-ray guidance (34 seconds, P = .436). Among experienced operators, catheterization was faster with x-ray guidance (20 seconds) compared with 1.5-T MR imaging (42 seconds, P < .001), but MARC guidance improved at 3 T (31 seconds). MARC MR imaging guidance at 3 T was not significantly different from x-ray guidance for the celiac (P = .755), superior mesenteric (P = .358), and inferior mesenteric (P = .065) arteries.Multiplanar navigation with a new MARC catheter with real-time MR imaging at 1.5 T and 3 T is feasible and comparable to x-ray guidance for anteroposterior vessels at 3 T in a vascular phantom.",
        "Purpose To determine if patient survival and mechanisms of right ventricular failure in pulmonary hypertension could be predicted by using supervised machine learning of three-dimensional patterns of systolic cardiac motion. Materials and Methods The study was approved by a research ethics committee, and participants gave written informed consent. Two hundred fifty-six patients (143 women; mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 63 years \u00b1 17) with newly diagnosed pulmonary hypertension underwent cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, right-sided heart catheterization, and 6-minute walk testing with a median follow-up of 4.0 years. Semiautomated segmentation of short-axis cine images was used to create a three-dimensional model of right ventricular motion. Supervised principal components analysis was used to identify patterns of systolic motion that were most strongly predictive of survival. Survival prediction was assessed by using difference in median survival time and area under the curve with time-dependent receiver operating characteristic analysis for 1-year survival. Results At the end of follow-up, 36% of patients (93 of 256) died, and one underwent lung transplantation. Poor outcome was predicted by a loss of effective contraction in the septum and free wall, coupled with reduced basal longitudinal motion. When added to conventional imaging and hemodynamic, functional, and clinical markers, three-dimensional cardiac motion improved survival prediction (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.73 vs 0.60, respectively; P < .001) and provided greater differentiation according to difference in median survival time between high- and low-risk groups (13.8 vs 10.7 years, respectively; P < .001). Conclusion A machine-learning survival model that uses three-dimensional cardiac motion predicts outcome independent of conventional risk factors in patients with newly diagnosed pulmonary hypertension.

        "Purpose To compare the performance of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) and two-dimensional synthetic mammography (SM) with that of digital mammography (DM) in a population-based mammographic screening program. Materials and Methods In this prospective cohort study, data from 37 185 women screened with DBT and SM and from 61 742 women screened with DM as part of a population-based screening program in 2014 and 2015 were included. Early performance measures, including recall rate due to abnormal mammographic findings, rate of screen-detected breast cancer, positive predictive value of recall, positive predictive value of needle biopsy, histopathologic type, tumor size, tumor grade, lymph node involvement, hormonal status, Ki-67 level, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status were compared in women who underwent DBT and SM screening and in those who underwent DM screening by using \u03c72 tests, two-sample unpaired t tests, and tests of proportions. Results Recall rates were 3.4% for DBT and SM screening and 3.3% for DM screening (P = .563). DBT and SM screening showed a significantly higher rate of screen-detected cancer compared with DM screening (9.4 vs 6.1 cancers per 1000 patients screened, respectively; P < .001). The rate of detection of tumors 10 mm or smaller was 3.2 per 1000 patients screened with DBT and SM and 1.8 per 1000 patients screened with DM (P < .001), and the rate of grade 1 tumors was 3.3 per 1000 patients screened with DBT and SM versus 1.4 per 1000 patients screened with DM (P < .001). On the basis of immunohistochemical analyses, rates of lymph node involvement and tumor subtypes did not differ between women who underwent DBT and SM screening and those who underwent DM screening. Conclusion DBT and SM screening increased the detection rate of histologically favorable tumors compared with that attained with DM screening. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Background Mammographic density improves the accuracy of breast cancer risk models. However, the use of breast density is limited by subjective assessment, variation across radiologists, and restricted data. A mammography-based deep learning (DL) model may provide more accurate risk prediction. Purpose To develop a mammography-based DL breast cancer risk model that is more accurate than established clinical breast cancer risk models. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included 88 994 consecutive screening mammograms in 39 571 women between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2012. For each patient, all examinations were assigned to either training, validation, or test sets, resulting in 71 689, 8554, and 8751 examinations, respectively. Cancer outcomes were obtained through linkage to a regional tumor registry. By using risk factor information from patient questionnaires and electronic medical records review, three models were developed to assess breast cancer risk within 5 years: a risk-factor-based logistic regression model (RF-LR) that used traditional risk factors, a DL model (image-only DL) that used mammograms alone, and a hybrid DL model that used both traditional risk factors and mammograms. Comparisons were made to an established breast cancer risk model that included breast density (Tyrer-Cuzick model, version 8 [TC]). Model performance was compared by using areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) with DeLong test (P < .05). Results The test set included 3937 women, aged 56.20 years \u00b1 10.04. Hybrid DL and image-only DL showed AUCs of 0.70 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.66, 0.75) and 0.68 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.73), respectively. RF-LR and TC showed AUCs of 0.67 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.72) and 0.62 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.66), respectively. Hybrid DL showed a significantly higher AUC (0.70) than TC (0.62; P < .001) and RF-LR (0.67; P = .01). Conclusion Deep learning models that use full-field mammograms yield substantially improved risk discrimination compared with the Tyrer-Cuzick (version 8) model. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "To investigate whether the presence of myocardial infarction (MI) detected with late gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is an independent predictor of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) in patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and those with overt diabetes mellitus (DM).Institutional review board approval was obtained for this study, and all subjects provided written informed consent. Late gadolinium-enhanced and cine MR imaging were performed in 190 patients with IFG and 160 patients with DM without known previous MI to evaluate the presence and extent of late gadolinium enhancement as well as global and regional left ventricular function. MACEs were defined as cardiac death, MI, unstable angina, heart failure, and ventricular arrhythmia. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to investigate the relationship between clinical and MR imaging variables and MACEs.Follow-up information was obtained in 181 of the 190 patients with IFG (95%) and 151 of the 160 patients with DM (94%). MACEs were observed in 15 of the 181 patients with IFG (8.3%) and 24 of the 151 with DM (15.9%). Late gadolinium enhancement was an independent predictor for MACE in both the IFG group (adjusted hazard ratio, 5.186; P = .003) and DM group (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.229; P = .015). MACE-free survival was significantly higher in patients with IFG than in those with DM (P = .019, log-rank test). However, the MACE-free survival curve for patients with IFG and late gadolinium enhancement was similar to that for patients with DM and late gadolinium enhancement (P = .735).The presence of MI detected with late gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging is the strongest multivariable predictor of adverse cardiac events in patients with IFG. Late gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging may help identify a subpopulation of subjects in the prediabetic stage who may benefit from more intensive treatments.",
        "Purpose To determine whether gadolinium deposits in neural tissues of patients with intracranial abnormalities following intravenous gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) exposure might be related to blood-brain barrier integrity by studying adult patients with normal brain pathologic characteristics. Materials and Methods After obtaining antemortem consent and institutional review board approval, the authors compared postmortem neuronal tissue samples from five patients who had undergone four to 18 gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) examinations between 2005 and 2014 (contrast group) with samples from 10 gadolinium-naive patients who had undergone at least one MR examination during their lifetime (control group). All patients in the contrast group had received gadodiamide. Neuronal tissues from the dentate nuclei, pons, globus pallidus, and thalamus were harvested and analyzed with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, and light microscopy to quantify, localize, and assess the effects of gadolinium deposition. Results Tissues from the four neuroanatomic regions of gadodiamide-exposed patients contained 0.1\u201319.4 \u03bcg of gadolinium per gram of tissue in a statistically significant dose-dependent relationship (globus pallidus: \u03c1 = 0.90, P = .04). In contradistinction, patients in the control group had undetectable levels of gadolinium with ICP-MS. All patients had normal brain pathologic characteristics at autopsy. Three patients in the contrast group had borderline renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate <45 mL/min/1.73 m2) and hepatobiliary dysfunction at MR examination. Gadolinium deposition in the contrast group was localized to the capillary endothelium and neuronal interstitium and, in two cases, within the nucleus of the cell. Conclusion Gadolinium deposition in neural tissues after GBCA administration occurs in the absence of intracranial abnormalities that might affect the permeability of the blood-brain barrier. These findings challenge current understanding of the biodistribution of these contrast agents and their safety. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017",
        "Background Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a target of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), demonstrates its highest surface expression in the lung, small bowel, and vasculature, suggesting abdominal viscera may be susceptible to injury. Purpose To report abdominal imaging findings in patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Materials and Methods In this retrospective cross-sectional study, patients consecutively admitted to a single quaternary care center from March 27 to April 10, 2020, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were included. Abdominal imaging studies performed in these patients were reviewed, and salient findings were recorded. Medical records were reviewed for clinical data. Univariable analysis and logistic regression were performed. Results A total of 412 patients (average age, 57 years; range, 18 to >90 years; 241 men, 171 women) were evaluated. A total of 224 abdominal imaging studies were performed (radiography, n = 137; US, n = 44; CT, n = 42; MRI, n = 1) in 134 patients (33%). Abdominal imaging was associated with age (odds ratio [OR], 1.03 per year of increase; P = .001) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission (OR, 17.3; P < .001). Bowel-wall abnormalities were seen on 31% of CT images (13 of 42) and were associated with ICU admission (OR, 15.5; P = .01). Bowel findings included pneumatosis or portal venous gas, seen on 20% of CT images obtained in patients in the ICU (four of 20). Surgical correlation (n = 4) revealed unusual yellow discoloration of the bowel (n = 3) and bowel infarction (n = 2). Pathologic findings revealed ischemic enteritis with patchy necrosis and fibrin thrombi in arterioles (n = 2). Right upper quadrant US examinations were mostly performed because of liver laboratory findings (87%, 32 of 37), and 54% (20 of 37) revealed a dilated sludge-filled gallbladder, suggestive of bile stasis. Patients with a cholecystostomy tube placed (n = 4) had negative bacterial cultures. Conclusion Bowel abnormalities and gallbladder bile stasis were common findings on abdominal images of patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Patients who underwent laparotomy often had ischemia, possibly due to small-vessel thrombosis. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020",
        "Purpose To characterize the progression of healing across aneurysm necks following treatment with a flow diverter in a rabbit aneurysm model. Materials and Methods With institutional animal care and use committee approval, saccular aneurysms were created in 20 rabbits and treated with flow diverters. On days 1, 3, and 7 and weeks 4 and 8 after implantation, the aneurysm and the device-implanted vessel were harvested. En face staining of the gross specimen was performed for endothelial cells, endothelial progenitor cells, smooth muscle cells, and inflammatory cells. Results The parent artery segments covered by the flow diverters were completely devoid of endothelial cells at 1 and 3 days but had completely reendothelialized by 7 days. At all time points, the struts along the patent portions of the aneurysm necks harbored scattered tissue islands composed exclusively of inflammatory cells. At 4 and 8 weeks, all samples contiguous with the tissue along the parent arteries had translucent tissue present along the occluded segments of the aneurysm neck. The vast majority of endothelial cells were contiguous with the parent artery and had smooth muscle cells underlying them. Endothelial progenitor cells were not observed along the neck of any aneurysm. Aneurysm closure was noted only when complete or nearly complete endothelialization over the device struts was present. Conclusion The initial event following flow diversion treatment is adherence of clusters of inflammatory cells across the aneurysm neck. Endothelialization is relatively delayed and derived exclusively from cells in the adjacent parent artery. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "Purpose To document utility of shear-wave (SW) elastography for assessing liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis B and to compare its performance with that of transient elastography. Materials and Methods Ethics committee approved the study, and informed consent was obtained. Patients with liver biopsy correlation (n = 226) and healthy patients (n = 171) were analyzed. Results of SW elastography of liver, SW elastography of spleen, and transient elastography of liver were compared and correlated according to METAVIR scores. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs), binary logistic regression, and Delong test were used. Results AUC for SW elastography of liver, transient elastography of liver, and SW elastography of spleen was, respectively, 0.86, 0.80, and 0.81 for fibrosis (\u2265F1 stage); 0.88, 0.78, and 0.82 for moderate fibrosis (\u2265F2 stage); 0.93, 0.83, and 0.83 for severe fibrosis (\u2265F3 stage); and 0.98, 0.92, and 0.84 for cirrhosis (F4 stage). SW elastography of liver showed significantly higher accuracy than transient elastography of liver and SW elastography of spleen in all fibrosis stages (P = .01\u2013.04). SW elastography of spleen showed similar accuracy with transient elastography of liver (P = .21\u2013.99). Combination SW elastography of liver and SW elastography of spleen to predict fibrosis staging showed diagnostic accuracy not further improved compared with SW elastography of liver alone (similar AUC; \u2265F1, P = .87; \u2265F2, P = .81; \u2265F3, P = .84; \u2265F4, P = .88). SW elastography of liver had higher successful rate than transient elastography of liver (98.9% vs 89.6%). Prevalence of discordance in at least two stages with liver histologic staging was 10.2% (23 of 226) for SW elastography of liver and 28.2% (58 of 206) for SW elastography of spleen. Conclusion SW elastography provides more accurate correlation of liver elasticity with liver fibrosis stage compared with transient elastography, especially in identification of stage F2 or greater. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "Purpose To develop a deep learning\u2013based method for fully automated quantification of left ventricular (LV) function from short-axis cine MR images and to evaluate its performance in a multivendor and multicenter setting. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included cine MRI data sets obtained from three major MRI vendors in four medical centers from 2008 to 2016. Three convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with the U-NET architecture were trained on data sets of increasing variability: (a) a single-vendor, single-center, homogeneous cohort of 100 patients (CNN1); (b) a single-vendor, multicenter, heterogeneous cohort of 200 patients (CNN2); and (c) a multivendor, multicenter, heterogeneous cohort of 400 patients (CNN3). All CNNs were tested on an independent multivendor, multicenter data set of 196 patients. CNN performance was evaluated with respect to the manual annotations from three experienced observers in terms of (a) LV detection accuracy, (b) LV segmentation accuracy, and (c) LV functional parameter accuracy. Automatic and manual results were compared with the paired Wilcoxon test, Pearson correlation, and Bland-Altman analysis. Results CNN3 achieved the highest performance on the independent testing data set. The average perpendicular distance compared with manual analysis was 1.1 mm \u00b1 0.3 for CNN3, compared with 1.5 mm \u00b1 1.0 for CNN1 (P < .05) and 1.3 mm \u00b1 0.6 for CNN2 (P < .05). The LV function parameters derived from CNN3 showed a high correlation (r2 \u2265 0.98) and agreement with those obtained by experts for data sets from different vendors and centers. Conclusion A deep learning\u2013based method trained on a data set with high variability can achieve fully automated and accurate cine MRI analysis on multivendor, multicenter cine MRI data. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 See also the editorial by Colletti in this issue.",

        "History A 68-year-old man with a remote history of a previously resected high-grade urothelial carcinoma in the renal pelvis was being observed and was undergoing urologic treatment for recurrent low-grade urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. During his most recent evaluation, he reported no specific symptoms and denied experiencing hematuria, dysuria, or abdominal pain. At routine surveillance MRI of the abdomen and pelvis (images not shown), a lesion was noted in the peripheral zone of the prostate gland. The prostate-specific antigen level was elevated (7.51 ng/mL [normal range, 0.00\u20134.00 ng/mL]). The patient had no family history of prostate cancer and had never undergone prostate biopsy. MRI of the prostate with an endorectal coil was subsequently performed.",
        "Purpose To assess the ability of an engineered epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)\u2013binding fibronectin domain to serve as a positron emission tomographic (PET) probe for molecular imaging of EGFR in a xenograft mouse model. Materials and Methods An EGFR-binding fibronectin domain (fibronectin abbreviated to Fn when bound) was site-specifically labeled with copper 64 (64Cu) (8 MBq/nmol). Copper 64\u2013Fn binding was tested in cell cultures with varying EGFR expression. Stability in human and mouse serum was measured in vitro. Animal experiments were approved by the Stanford University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Copper 64\u2013Fn (approximately 2 MBq) was used for PET in mice (n = 5) bearing EGFR-overexpressing xenografted tumors (approximately 5\u201310 mm in diameter). Results of tomography were compared with those of ex vivo gamma counting of dissected tissues. Statistical analysis was performed with t tests and adjustment for multiple comparisons. Results Copper 64\u2013Fn exhibited EGFR-dependent binding to multiple cell lines in culture. The tracer was stable for 24 hours in human and mouse serum at 37\u00b0C. The tracer exhibited good tumor localization (3.4% injected dose [ID]/g \u00b1 1.0 [standard deviation] at 1 hour), retention (2.7% ID/g \u00b1 0.6 at 24 hours), and specificity (8.6 \u00b1 3.0 tumor-to-muscle ratio, 8.9 \u00b1 4.7 tumor-to-blood ratio at 1 hour). Specific targeting was verified with low localization to low-expressing MDA-MB-435 tumors (0.7% ID/g \u00b1 0.8 at 1 hour, P = .018); specificity was further demonstrated, as a nonbinding control fibronectin had low localization to EGFR-overexpressing xenografts (0.8% ID/g \u00b1 0.2 at 1 hour, P = .013). Conclusion The stability, low background, and target-specific tumor uptake and retention of the engineered fibronectin domain make it a promising EGFR molecular imaging agent. More broadly, it validates the fibronectin domain as a potential scaffold for a generation of various molecular imaging agents. \u00a9 RSNA, 2012 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.12111504/-/DC1",
        "To describe the use of an imaging selection tool, multiphase computed tomographic (CT) angiography, in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and to demonstrate its interrater reliability and ability to help determine clinical outcome.The local ethics board approved this study. Data are from the pilot phase of PRoveIT, a prospective observational study analyzing utility of multimodal imaging in the triage of patients with AIS. Patients underwent baseline unenhanced CT, single-phase CT angiography of the head and neck, multiphase CT angiography, and perfusion CT. Multiphase CT angiography generates time-resolved images of pial arteries. Pial arterial filling was scored on a six-point ordinal scale, and interrater reliability was tested. Clinical outcomes included a 50% or greater decrease in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) over 24 hours and 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-2. The ability to predict clinical outcomes was compared between single-phase CT angiography, multiphase CT angiography, and perfusion CT by using receiver operating curve analysis, Akaike information criterion (AIC), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC).A total of 147 patients were included. Interrater reliability for multiphase CT angiography is excellent (n = 30, \u03ba = 0.81, P < .001). At receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the ability to predict clinical outcome is modest (C statistic = 0.56, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.52, 0.63 for \u226550% decrease in NIHSS over 24 hours; C statistic = 0.6, 95% CI: 0.53, 0.68 for 90-day mRS score of 0-2) but better than that of models using single-phase CT angiography and perfusion CT (P < .05 overall). With AIC and BIC, models that use multiphase CT angiography are better than models that use single-phase CT angiography and perfusion CT for a decrease of 50% or more in NIHSS over 24 hours (AIC = 166, BIC = 171.7; values were lowest for multiphase CT angiography) and a 90-day mRS score of 0-2 (AIC = 132.1, BIC = 137.4; values were lowest for multiphase CT angiography).Multiphase CT angiography is a reliable tool for imaging selection in patients with AIS.",
        "Purpose To evaluate whether a dual-energy (DE) computed tomographic (CT) virtual noncalcium technique can improve the detection rate of acute thoracolumbar vertebral compression fractures in patients with osteoporosis compared with that at magnetic resonance (MR) imaging depending on the level of experience of the reading radiologist. Materials and Methods This retrospective study was approved by the institutional ethics committee. Informed consent was obtained from all patients. Forty-nine patients with osteoporosis who were suspected of having acute vertebral fracture underwent DE CT and MR imaging. Conventional linear-blended CT scans and corresponding virtual noncalcium reconstructions were obtained. Five radiologists with varying levels of experience evaluated gray-scale CT scans for the presence of fractures and their suspected age. Then, virtual noncalcium images were evaluated to detect bone marrow edema. Findings were compared with those from MR imaging (the standard of reference). Sensitivity and specificity analyses for diagnostic performance and matched pair analyses were performed on vertebral fracture and patient levels. Results Sixty-two fractures were classified as fresh and 52 as old at MR imaging. The diagnostic performance of all readers in the detection of fresh fractures improved with the addition of virtual noncalcium reconstructions compared with that with conventional CT alone. Although the diagnostic accuracy of the least experienced reader with virtual noncalcium CT (accuracy with CT alone, 61%; accuracy with virtual noncalcium technique, 83%) was within the range of that of the most experienced reader with CT alone, the latter improved his accuracy with the noncalcium technique (from 81% to 95%), coming close to that with MR imaging. The number of vertebrae rated as unclear decreased by 59%-90% or from 15-53 to 2-13 in absolute numbers across readers. The number of patients potentially referred to MR imaging decreased by 36%-87% (from 11-23 to 2-10 patients). Considering the gain in true decisions with the virtual noncalcium technique on a patient level, between 12 (most experienced reader) and 17 (least experienced reader) MR examinations could have been avoided. Conclusion The DE CT-based virtual noncalcium technique may enable depiction of bone marrow edema in thoracolumbar vertebral compression fractures in patients with osteoporosis, with good accordance with MR imaging when images are read by experienced radiologists. Although less experienced readers improved their diagnostic performance to some degree, the experienced reader's diagnostic performance approached that with MR imaging. (\u00a9) RSNA, 2016.",
        "History A 24-year-old right-handed woman presented to a neuro-ophthalmology clinic in Massachusetts in the summer with acute binocular diplopia when looking down and to the left, which started about 1 month earlier. Her medical history was notable for Raynaud syndrome, recurrent streptococcal pharyngitis, and an allergy to amoxicillin. Three days prior to developing diplopia, she presented to an outside emergency department due to fever, chills, and back pain. She received ciprofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection based on urinalysis, which demonstrated few bacteria and was negative for leukocyte esterase, nitrites, and white blood cells. She then presented again to an outside emergency department for diplopia evaluation. Initial MRI and MR angiography of the brain at that time did not demonstrate any relevant findings, and the patient was referred to our department for neuro-ophthalmic evaluation, where she was seen 4 weeks later. Neuro-ophthalmic examination revealed 20/20 visual acuity in both eyes, and a right hypertropia in left gaze, downgaze and right head tilt, with right eye excyclotorsion. There were no ocular signs of myasthenia gravis or thyroid eye disease, nor did the patient report ocular or systemic symptoms. She denied recent travel. High-spatial-resolution MRI of the brain and orbit were performed.",
        "To perform a radiogenomic analysis of women with breast cancer to study the multiscale relationships among quantitative computer vision-extracted dynamic contrast material-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging phenotypes, early metastasis, and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) expression determined by means of high-resolution next-generation RNA sequencing.In this institutional review board-approved study, an automated image analysis platform extracted 47 computational quantitative features from DCE MR imaging data in a training set (n = 19) to screen for MR imaging biomarkers indicative of poor metastasis-free survival (MFS). The lncRNA molecular landscape of the candidate feature was defined by using an RNA sequencing-specific negative binomial distribution differential expression analysis. Then, this radiogenomic biomarker was applied prospectively to a validation set (n = 42) to allow prediction of MFS and lncRNA expression by using quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis.The quantitative MR imaging feature, enhancing rim fraction score, was predictive of MFS in the training set (P = .007). RNA sequencing analysis yielded an average of 55.7 \u00d7 10(6) reads per sample and identified 14 880 lncRNAs from a background of 189 883 transcripts per sample. Radiogenomic analysis allowed identification of three previously uncharacterized and five named lncRNAs significantly associated with high enhancing rim fraction, including Homeobox transcript antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR) (P < .05), a known predictor of poor MFS in patients with breast cancer. Independent validation confirmed the association of the enhancing rim fraction phenotype with both MFS (P = .002) and expression of four of the top five differentially expressed lncRNAs (P < .05), including HOTAIR.The enhancing rim fraction score, a quantitative DCE MR imaging lncRNA radiogenomic biomarker, is associated with early metastasis and expression of the known predictor of metastatic progression, HOTAIR.",
        "Purpose To develop and evaluate a supportive algorithm using deep learning for detecting cerebral aneurysms at time-of-flight MR angiography to provide a second assessment of images already interpreted by radiologists. Materials and Methods MR images reported by radiologists to contain aneurysms were extracted from four institutions for the period from November 2006 through October 2017. The images were divided into three data sets: training data set, internal test data set, and external test data set. The algorithm was constructed by deep learning with the training data set, and its sensitivity to detect aneurysms in the test data sets was evaluated. To find aneurysms that had been overlooked in the initial reports, two radiologists independently performed a blinded interpretation of aneurysm candidates detected by the algorithm. When there was disagreement, the final diagnosis was made in consensus. The number of newly detected aneurysms was also evaluated. Results The training data set, which provided training and validation data, included 748 aneurysms (mean size, 3.1 mm \u00b1 2.0 [standard deviation]) from 683 examinations; 318 of these examinations were on male patients (mean age, 63 years \u00b1 13) and 365 were on female patients (mean age, 64 years \u00b1 13). Test data were provided by the internal test data set (649 aneurysms [mean size, 4.1 mm \u00b1 3.2] in 521 examinations, including 177 male patients and 344 female patients with mean age of 66 years \u00b1 12 and 67 years \u00b1 13, respectively) and the external test data set (80 aneurysms [mean size, 4.1 mm \u00b1 2.1] in 67 examinations, including 19 male patients and 48 female patients with mean age of 63 years \u00b1 12 and 68 years \u00b1 12, respectively). The sensitivity was 91% (592 of 649) and 93% (74 of 80) for the internal and external test data sets, respectively. The algorithm improved aneurysm detection in the internal and external test data sets by 4.8% (31 of 649) and 13% (10 of 80), respectively, compared with the initial reports. Conclusion A deep learning algorithm detected cerebral aneurysms in radiologic reports with high sensitivity and improved aneurysm detection compared with the initial reports. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 See also the editorial by Flanders in this issue.",
        "To develop a magnetic resonance (MR) \"fingerprinting\" technique for quantitative abdominal imaging.This HIPAA-compliant study had institutional review board approval, and informed consent was obtained from all subjects. To achieve accurate quantification in the presence of marked B0 and B1 field inhomogeneities, the MR fingerprinting framework was extended by using a two-dimensional fast imaging with steady-state free precession, or FISP, acquisition and a Bloch-Siegert B1 mapping method. The accuracy of the proposed technique was validated by using agarose phantoms. Quantitative measurements were performed in eight asymptomatic subjects and in six patients with 20 focal liver lesions. A two-tailed Student t test was used to compare the T1 and T2 results in metastatic adenocarcinoma with those in surrounding liver parenchyma and healthy subjects.Phantom experiments showed good agreement with standard methods in T1 and T2 after B1 correction. In vivo studies demonstrated that quantitative T1, T2, and B1 maps can be acquired within a breath hold of approximately 19 seconds. T1 and T2 measurements were compatible with those in the literature. Representative values included the following: liver, 745 msec \u00b1 65 (standard deviation) and 31 msec \u00b1 6; renal medulla, 1702 msec \u00b1 205 and 60 msec \u00b1 21; renal cortex, 1314 msec \u00b1 77 and 47 msec \u00b1 10; spleen, 1232 msec \u00b1 92 and 60 msec \u00b1 19; skeletal muscle, 1100 msec \u00b1 59 and 44 msec \u00b1 9; and fat, 253 msec \u00b1 42 and 77 msec \u00b1 16, respectively. T1 and T2 in metastatic adenocarcinoma were 1673 msec \u00b1 331 and 43 msec \u00b1 13, respectively, significantly different from surrounding liver parenchyma relaxation times of 840 msec \u00b1 113 and 28 msec \u00b1 3 (P < .0001 and P < .01) and those in hepatic parenchyma in healthy volunteers (745 msec \u00b1 65 and 31 msec \u00b1 6, P < .0001 and P = .021, respectively).A rapid technique for quantitative abdominal imaging was developed that allows simultaneous quantification of multiple tissue properties within one 19-second breath hold, with measurements comparable to those in published literature.",
        "Purpose To evaluate the potential utility of a number of parameters obtained at T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic contrast material\u2013enhanced multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of prostate cancer and assessment of cancer aggressiveness. Materials and Methods In this institutional review board\u2013approved HIPAA-compliant study, multiparametric MR images were acquired with an endorectal coil in 48 patients with prostate cancer (median age, 62.5 years; age range, 44\u201373 years) who subsequently underwent prostatectomy. A radiologist and a pathologist identified 104 regions of interest (ROIs) (61 cancer ROIs, 43 normal ROIs) based on correlation of histologic and MR findings. The 10th percentile and average apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values, T2-weighted signal intensity histogram skewness, and Tofts Ktrans were analyzed, both individually and combined, via linear discriminant analysis, with receiver operating characteristic curve analysis with area under the curve (AUC) as figure of merit, to distinguish cancer foci from normal foci. Spearman rank-order correlation (\u03c1) was calculated between cancer foci Gleason score (GS) and image features. Results AUC (maximum likelihood estimate \u00b1 standard error) values in the differentiation of prostate cancer from normal foci of 10th percentile ADC, average ADC, T2-weighted skewness, and Ktrans were 0.92 \u00b1 0.03, 0.89 \u00b1 0.03, 0.86 \u00b1 0.04, and 0.69 \u00b1 0.04, respectively. The combination of 10th percentile ADC, average ADC, and T2-weighted skewness yielded an AUC value for the same task of 0.95 \u00b1 0.02. GS correlated moderately with 10th percentile ADC (\u03c1 = \u22120.34, P = .008), average ADC (\u03c1 = \u22120.30, P = .02), and Ktrans (\u03c1 = 0.38, P = .004). Conclusion The combination of 10th percentile ADC, average ADC, and T2-weighted skewness with CAD is promising in the differentiation of prostate cancer from normal tissue. ADC image features and Ktrans moderately correlate with GS. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "To determine if quantitative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging techniques (sodium MR imaging, glycosaminoglycan [GAG] chemical exchange saturation transfer [CEST], and T2* mapping) could be used as potential markers for biochemical changes in the Achilles tendon induced by ciprofloxacin intake.The ethics committee of the Medical University of Vienna approved the protocol (number 1225/2012), and all patients gave written informed consent. Fourteen ankles from seven men (mean age, 32 years \u00b1 12 [standard deviation]) were included in the study. All patients underwent 7-T MR imaging examinations of the Achilles tendon at baseline and 10 days and 5 months after ciprofloxacin intake. Sodium signal and T2* maps were acquired with the variable echo-time sequence and the GAG CEST values were acquired with a three-dimensional radiofrequency spoiled gradient-recalled-echo sequence.The mean sodium signal was significantly decreased by 25% in the whole tendon (from baseline to 10 days after ciprofloxacin intake, 130 arbitrary units [au] \u00b1 8 to 98 au \u00b1 5, respectively; P = .023) and returned to baseline after 5 months (116 au \u00b1 10), as observed also at the tendon insertion (baseline, 10 days after ciprofloxacin intake, and 5 months after ciprofloxacin intake, 134 au \u00b1 8, 105 au \u00b1 5, and 119 au \u00b1 9, respectively; P = .034). The mean GAG CEST value in the whole tendon was parallel to the sodium signal with a decrease from baseline to 10 days after ciprofloxacin intake, 4.74% \u00b1 0.75 to 4.50% \u00b1 0.23, respectively (P = .028) and an increase at 5 months after ciprofloxacin intake to 4.88% \u00b1 1.02.In conclusion, this study demonstrates a ciprofloxacin-induced reversible reduction of the normalized sodium MR imaging signal and the GAG CEST effect in the Achilles tendon of healthy volunteers. Changes in sodium MR imaging and GAG CEST in men may reflect a decrease of GAG content in the Achilles tendon after ciprofloxacin intake.",
        "Purpose To reduce radiotracer requirements for amyloid PET/MRI without sacrificing diagnostic quality by using deep learning methods. Materials and Methods Forty data sets from 39 patients (mean age \u00b1 standard deviation [SD], 67 years \u00b1 8), including 16 male patients and 23 female patients (mean age, 66 years \u00b1 6 and 68 years \u00b1 9, respectively), who underwent simultaneous amyloid (fluorine 18 [18F]\u2013florbetaben) PET/MRI examinations were acquired from March 2016 through October 2017 and retrospectively analyzed. One hundredth of the raw list-mode PET data were randomly chosen to simulate a low-dose (1%) acquisition. Convolutional neural networks were implemented with low-dose PET and multiple MR images (PET-plus-MR model) or with low-dose PET alone (PET-only) as inputs to predict full-dose PET images. Quality of the synthesized images was evaluated while Bland-Altman plots assessed the agreement of regional standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) between image types. Two readers scored image quality on a five-point scale (5 = excellent) and determined amyloid status (positive or negative). Statistical analyses were carried out to assess the difference of image quality metrics and reader agreement and to determine confidence intervals (CIs) for reading results. Results The synthesized images (especially from the PET-plus-MR model) showed marked improvement on all quality metrics compared with the low-dose image. All PET-plus-MR images scored 3 or higher, with proportions of images rated greater than 3 similar to those for the full-dose images (\u221210% difference [eight of 80 readings], 95% CI: \u221215%, \u22125%). Accuracy for amyloid status was high (71 of 80 readings [89%]) and similar to intrareader reproducibility of full-dose images (73 of 80 [91%]). The PET-plus-MR model also had the smallest mean and variance for SUVR difference to full-dose images. Conclusion Simultaneously acquired MRI and ultra\u2013low-dose PET data can be used to synthesize full-dose\u2013like amyloid PET images. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "To examine recall rates from screening mammography and the mammographic findings that caused recall in women who underwent digital breast tomosynthesis with conventional mammography (referred to as two-dimensional [ 2D two-dimensional ] with three-dimensional [ 3D three-dimensional ] imaging [ 2D two-dimensional + 3D three-dimensional ]) and in women who underwent conventional mammography alone (referred to as 2D two-dimensional ).This was an institutional review board-approved, HIPAA-compliant study with waivers of informed consent. A retrospective review of 2D two-dimensional + 3D three-dimensional and 2D two-dimensional screening mammograms from August 1, 2011, to December 31, 2012, was performed. Recall rates and abnormalities that caused recall were compared by controlling for differences in patient age, breast density, and risk factors. Cancer detection rate was assessed from this time period and from 1 year before the introduction of tomosynthesis for a historic control.This study included 17 955 screening mammograms; of the total, there were 8591 (47.8%) 2D two-dimensional + 3D three-dimensional screening examinations and 9364 (52.2%) 2D two-dimensional examinations. The recall rate was 7.8% (671 of 8592) for 2D two-dimensional + 3D three-dimensional and 12.3% (1154 of 9364) for 2D two-dimensional (P < .0001); the rate of recall was 36.6% lower in the 2D two-dimensional + 3D three-dimensional group than in the 2D two-dimensional group. Recall rates for the 2D two-dimensional + 3D three-dimensional group were significantly lower for patients with asymmetries, ( 2D two-dimensional + 3D three-dimensional vs 2D two-dimensional , 3.1% [267 of 8591] vs 7.4% [689 of 9364], respectively; P < .0001) and calcifications ( 2D two-dimensional + 3D three-dimensional vs 2D two-dimensional , 2.4% [205 of 8591] vs 3.2% [297 of 9364], respectively; P = .0014). For patients with masses and architectural distortion, the difference in recall rates was not significant (masses: 2D two-dimensional + 3D three-dimensional vs 2D two-dimensional , 2.5% [215 of 8591] vs 2.5% [237 of 9364], respectively; P = .90; architectural distortion: 2D two-dimensional + 3D three-dimensional vs 2D two-dimensional , 0.68% [58 of 8591] vs 0.69% [65 of 9364]; P = .88). Cancer detection was highest in the 2D two-dimensional + 3D three-dimensional group at 5.9 cancers per 1000 examinations, with 5.7 cancers per 1000 examinations in the concurrent 2D two-dimensional group, and 4.4 cancers per 1000 examinations in the historic control.Use of tomosynthesis ( 2D two-dimensional + 3D three-dimensional ) compared with conventional mammography ( 2D two-dimensional ) is associated with a lower recall rate of screening mammography, most often for asymmetries.",

        "Purpose To determine if a molecular imaging approach targeting the highly oxidative enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) can help noninvasively identify and confirm sites of vascular wall inflammation in a murine model of vasculitis. Materials and Methods Animal experiments were approved by the institutional animal care committee. Twenty-six mice were studied, including eight MPO-deficient and six sham-operated mice as controls. Vasculitis was induced with intraperitoneal injection of Candida albicans water-soluble fraction (CAWS). Aortic root magnetic resonance imaging was performed after intravenous injection of the activatable MPO sensor (bis-5-hydroxytryptamide-diethylenetriaminepentatacetate gadolinium) (n = 23), referred to as MPO-Gd, or gadopentetate dimeglumine (n = 10). Seven mice were randomly assigned to receive either MPO-Gd or gadopentetate dimeglumine first. Aortic root specimens were collected for biochemical and histopathologic analyses to validate imaging findings. Statistical significance was calculated for contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) by using the paired t test. Results In the aortic root, the mean MPO-Gd CNRs after agent injection (CNR = 28.1) were more than 2.5-fold higher than those of sham-operated mice imaged with MPO-Gd and vasculitis mice imaged with gadopentetate dimeglumine (CNR = 10.6) (P < .05). MPO-Gd MR imaging helped identify areas of vasculitis that were not seen at unenhanced and contrast material\u2013enhanced imaging with gadopentetate dimeglumine. Histopathologic and biochemical analyses for MPO and myeloid cells confirmed imaging findings. In MPO-deficient mice, injection of CAWS did not result in a vasculitis phenotype, implying a key role of the imaging target in disease cause. Conclusion Molecular imaging targeting MPO can be a useful biomarker to noninvasively detect and confirm inflammation in vasculitis by using a murine model of Kawasaki disease. \u00a9 RSNA, 2011 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.11110040/-/DC1",
        "History A 19-year-old woman with no pertinent medical history was brought to the emergency department after being found unconscious on her bathroom floor by her roommate. In the preceding weeks, she had reported intractable nausea and vomiting, for which she had been taking ondansetron. No other medications had been prescribed. The day prior to presentation, she had contacted her mother and described increasing confusion. Glasgow coma scale score on arrival in the emergency department was 4. Intravenous naloxone was administered, without immediate response. Initial blood glucose level was 232 mg/dL (12.8 mmol/L) (normal range, 79-140 mg/dL [4.4- 7.7 mmol/L]), and other routine laboratory test results were normal. Urine toxicology results were negative. Cerebrospinal fluid evaluation revealed levels were within normal limits. Neurologic examination revealed dilated pupils, which showed a sluggish response to light, and left lower extremity rigidity with intermittent tremors. Initial unenhanced cranial computed tomographic (CT) findings were negative. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the brain was performed. The patient's condition deteriorated, with increasing cerebral edema over the next week, and she was declared brain dead. Her liver was transplanted into an adult recipient, who subsequently developed cerebral edema and elevated plasma ammonia levels, resulting in death in the immediate postoperative period.",

        "To determine radiation dose indexes for computed tomography (CT) performed with renal colic protocols in the United States, including frequency of reduced-dose technique usage and any institutional-level factors associated with high or low dose indexes.The Dose Imaging Registry (DIR) collects deidentified CT data, including examination type and dose indexes, for CT performed at participating institutions; thus, the DIR portion of the study was exempt from institutional review board approval and was HIPAA compliant. CT dose indexes were examined at the institutional level for CT performed with a renal colic protocol at institutions that contributed at least 10 studies to the registry as of January 2013. Additionally, patients undergoing CT for renal colic at a single institution (with institutional review board approval and informed consent from prospective subjects and waiver of consent from retrospective subjects) were studied to examine individual renal colic CT dose index patterns and explore relationships between patient habitus, demographics, and dose indexes. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze dose indexes, and linear regression and Spearman correlations were used to examine relationships between dose indexes and institutional factors.There were 49 903 renal colic protocol CT examinations conducted at 93 institutions between May 2011 and January 2013. Mean age \u00b1 standard deviation was 49 years \u00b1 18, and 53.9% of patients were female. Institutions contributed a median of 268 (interquartile range, 77-699) CT studies. Overall mean institutional dose-length product (DLP) was 746 mGy \u22c5 cm (effective dose, 11.2 mSv), with a range of 307-1497 mGy \u22c5 cm (effective dose, 4.6-22.5 mSv) for mean DLPs. Only 2% of studies were conducted with a DLP of 200 mGy \u22c5 cm or lower (a \"reduced dose\") (effective dose, 3 mSv), and only 10% of institutions kept DLP at 400 mGy \u22c5 cm (effective dose, 6 mSv) or less in at least 50% of patients.Reduced-dose renal protocol CT is used infrequently in the United States.

        "To compare the sensitivity and specificity of diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for identifying liver metastases from neuroendocrine tumor (NET) to those of T2-weighted fast spin-echo (FSE) and three-dimensional dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging, with surgical and histopathologic findings as the reference standard.This retrospective study was approved by institutional review board, and informed consent was waived. Fifty-nine patients with NETs (41 patients with 162 liver metastases, and 18 control subjects with no liver metastases) underwent MR imaging that included DW, T2-weighted FSE, and dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MR sequences. Images were retrospectively reviewed by two abdominal radiologists, independently, for the detection and characterization of liver metastases. MR findings were compared with histopathologic and intraoperative ultrasonography findings for metastasis on a lesion-by-lesion basis to determine the sensitivity of each MR sequence alone and combined. Specificity was calculated by using the control population. Interreader agreement for each MR sequence and McNemar test were also calculated.There was excellent agreement between observers 1 and 2 for characterizing liver metastases at per-lesion analysis (\u03ba coefficient: 0.86-1.00). DW MR was more sensitive (observer 1: sensitivity, 71.6% [116 of 162], 95% confidence interval [CI]: 64.2%, 78.0%; observer 2: sensitivity, 71.0% [115 of 162], 95% CI: 63.6%, 77.4%) than T2-weighted FSE (observer 1: sensitivity, 55.6% [90 of 162], 95% CI: 47.9%, 63.0%; observer 2: sensitivity, 55.6% [90 of 162], 95% CI: 47.9%, 63.0%) and dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MR (observer 1: sensitivity, 47.5% [77 of 162], 95% CI: 34.0%, 55.2%; observer 2: sensitivity, 48.1% [78 of 162], 95% CI: 40.6%, 55.8%) (P < .001 for both, McNemar test). The specificity of these sequences ranged from 88.9% to 100% (DW MR vs T2-weighted FSE MR: P > .99, DW MR vs dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MR: P = .61, and T2-weighted FSE MR vs dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MR: P = .61, McNemar test).DW MR imaging was more sensitive for the detection and characterization of liver metastases from NETs than T2-weighted FSE and dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging and should be systematically performed.",
        "Purpose To determine whether the predonation computed tomography (CT)-based volume of the future remnant kidney is predictive of postdonation renal function in living kidney donors. Materials and Methods This institutional review board-approved, retrospective, HIPAA-compliant study included 126 live kidney donors who had undergone predonation renal CT between January 2007 and December 2014 as well as 2-year postdonation measurement of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The whole kidney volume and cortical volume of the future remnant kidney were measured and standardized for body surface area (BSA). Bivariate linear associations between the ratios of whole kidney volume to BSA and cortical volume to BSA were obtained. A linear regression model for 2-year postdonation eGFR that incorporated donor age, sex, and either whole kidney volume-to-BSA ratio or cortical volume-to-BSA ratio was created, and the coefficient of determination (R2) for the model was calculated. Factors not statistically additive in assessing 2-year eGFR were removed by using backward elimination, and the coefficient of determination for this parsimonious model was calculated. Results Correlation was slightly better for cortical volume-to-BSA ratio than for whole kidney volume-to-BSA ratio (r = 0.48 vs r = 0.44, respectively). The linear regression model incorporating all donor factors had an R2 of 0.66. The only factors that were significantly additive to the equation were cortical volume-to-BSA ratio and predonation eGFR (P = .01 and P < .01, respectively), and the final parsimonious linear regression model incorporating these two variables explained almost the same amount of variance (R2 = 0.65) as did the full model. Conclusion The cortical volume of the future remnant kidney helped predict postdonation eGFR at 2 years. The cortical volume-to-BSA ratio should thus be considered for addition as an important variable to living kidney donor evaluation and selection guidelines. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018.",
        "Background Macrophage burden is a major factor in the risk of atherosclerotic plaque rupture, and its evaluation remains challenging with molecular noninvasive imaging approaches. Photon-counting CT (PCCT) with k-edge imaging aims to allow for the specific detection of macrophages using gold nanoparticles. Purpose To perform k-edge imaging in combination with gold nanoparticles to detect and quantify the macrophage burden within the atherosclerotic aortas of rabbits. Materials and Methods Atherosclerotic and control New Zealand white rabbits were imaged before and at several time points up to 2 days after intravenous injection of gold nanoparticles (3.5 mL/kg, 65 mg gold per milliliter). Aortic CT angiography was performed at the end of the follow-up using an intravenous injection of an iodinated contrast material. Gold k-edge and conventional CT images were reconstructed for qualitative and quantitative assessment of the macrophage burden. PCCT imaging results were compared with findings at histologic examination, quantitative histomorphometry, transmission electron microscopy, and quantitative inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. Pearson correlations between the macrophage area measured in immunostained sections and the concentration of gold and attenuation measured in the corresponding PCCT sections were calculated. Results Seven rabbits with atherosclerosis and four control rabbits without atherosclerosis were analyzed. In atherosclerotic rabbits, calcifications were observed along the aortic wall before injection. At 2 days after injection of gold nanoparticles, only gold k-edge images allowed for the distinction of plaque enhancement within calcifications and for lumen enhancement during angiography. A good correlation was observed between the gold concentration measured within the wall and the macrophage area in 35 plaques (five per rabbit) (r = 0.82; 95% CI: 0.67, 0.91; P < .001), which was higher than that observed on conventional CT images (r = 0.41; 95% CI: 0.09, 0.65; P = .01). Transmission electron microscopy and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry analyses confirmed the gold k-edge imaging findings. Conclusion Photon-counting CT with gold nanoparticles allowed for the noninvasive evaluation of both molecular and anatomic information in vivo in rabbits with atherosclerotic plaques.

        "To evaluate accuracy and interobserver variability with the use of the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 2.0 for detection of prostate cancer at multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in a biopsy-na\u00efve patient population.This retrospective HIPAA-compliant study was approved by the local ethics committee, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients for use of their imaging and histopathologic data in future research studies. In 101 biopsy-na\u00efve patients with elevated prostate-specific antigen levels who underwent multiparametric MR imaging of the prostate and subsequent transrectal ultrasonography (US)-MR imaging fusion-guided biopsy, suspicious lesions detected at multiparametric MR imaging were scored by five readers who were blinded to pathologic results by using to the newly revised PI-RADS and the scoring system developed in-house. Interobserver agreement was evaluated by using \u03ba statistics, and the correlation of pathologic results with each of the two scoring systems was evaluated by using the Kendall \u03c4 correlation coefficient.Specimens of 162 lesions in 94 patients were sampled by means of transrectal US-MR imaging fusion biopsy. Results for 87 (54%) lesions were positive for prostate cancer. Kendall \u03c4 values with the PI-RADS and the in-house-developed scoring system, respectively, at T2-weighted MR imaging in the peripheral zone were 0.51 and 0.17 and in the transitional zone, 0.45 and -0.11; at diffusion-weighted MR imaging, 0.42 and 0.28; at dynamic contrast material-enhanced MR imaging, 0.23 and 0.24, and overall suspicion scores were 0.42 and 0.49. Median \u03ba scores among all possible pairs of readers for PI-RADS and the in-house-developed scoring system, respectively, for T2-weighted MR images in the peripheral zone were 0.47 and 0.15; transitional zone, 0.37 and 0.07; diffusion-weighted MR imaging, 0.41 and 0.57; dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging, 0.48 and 0.41; and overall suspicion scores, 0.46 and 0.55.Use of the revised PI-RADS provides moderately reproducible MR imaging scores for detection of clinically relevant disease.",
        "To assess interpretation performance and radiation dose when two-dimensional synthesized mammography (SM) images versus standard full-field digital mammography (FFDM) images are used alone or in combination with digital breast tomosynthesis images.A fully crossed, mode-balanced multicase (n = 123), multireader (n = 8), retrospective observer performance study was performed by using deidentified images acquired between 2008 and 2011 with institutional review board approved, HIPAA-compliant protocols, during which each patient signed informed consent. The cohort included 36 cases of biopsy-proven cancer, 35 cases of biopsy-proven benign lesions, and 52 normal or benign cases (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System [BI-RADS] score of 1 or 2) with negative 1-year follow-up results. Accuracy of sequentially reported probability of malignancy ratings and seven-category forced BI-RADS ratings was evaluated by using areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) in the random-reader analysis.Probability of malignancy-based mean AUCs for SM and FFDM images alone was 0.894 and 0.889, respectively (difference, -0.005; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.062, 0.054; P = .85). Mean AUC for SM with tomosynthesis and FFDM with tomosynthesis was 0.916 and 0.939, respectively (difference, 0.023; 95% CI: -0.011, 0.057; P = .19). In terms of the reader-specific AUCs, five readers performed better with SM alone versus FFDM alone, and all eight readers performed better with combined FFDM and tomosynthesis (absolute differences from 0.003 to 0.052). Similar results were obtained by using a nonparametric analysis of forced BI-RADS ratings.SM alone or in combination with tomosynthesis is comparable in performance to FFDM alone or in combination with tomosynthesis and may eliminate the need for FFDM as part of a routine clinical study.",
        "Purpose To develop a silicon (Si) and cadmium telluride (CdTe) imaging Compton camera for biomedical application on the basis of technologies used for astrophysical observation and to test its capacity to perform three-dimensional (3D) imaging. Materials and Methods All animal experiments were performed according to the Animal Care and Experimentation Committee (Gunma University, Maebashi, Japan). Flourine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), iodine 131 (131I) methylnorcholestenol, and gallium 67 (67Ga) citrate, separately compacted into micro tubes, were inserted subcutaneously into a Wistar rat, and the distribution of the radioisotope compounds was determined with 3D imaging by using the Compton camera after the rat was sacrificed (ex vivo model). In a separate experiment, indium 111(111In) chloride and 131I-methylnorcholestenol were injected into a rat intravenously, and copper 64 (64Cu) chloride was administered into the stomach orally just before imaging. The isotope distributions were determined with 3D imaging after sacrifice by means of the list-mode-expectation-maximizing-maximum-likelihood method. Results The Si/CdTe Compton camera demonstrated its 3D multinuclear imaging capability by separating out the distributions of FDG, 131I-methylnorcholestenol, and 67Ga-citrate clearly in a test-tube\u2013implanted ex vivo model. In the more physiologic model with tail vein injection prior to sacrifice, the distributions of 131I-methylnorcholestenol and 64Cu-chloride were demonstrated with 3D imaging, and the difference in distribution of the two isotopes was successfully imaged although the accumulation on the image of 111In-chloride was difficult to visualize because of blurring at the low-energy region. Conclusion The Si/CdTe Compton camera clearly resolved the distribution of multiple isotopes in 3D imaging and simultaneously in the ex vivo model. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "Purpose To determine the usefulness of whole-body diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to assess the response of bone metastases to treatment in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Materials and Methods A phase II prospective clinical trial of the poly-(adenosine diphosphate\u2013ribose) polymerase inhibitor olaparib in mCRPC included a prospective magnetic resonance (MR) imaging substudy; the study was approved by the institutional research board, and written informed consent was obtained. Whole-body DWI was performed at baseline and after 12 weeks of olaparib administration by using 1.5-T MR imaging. Areas of abnormal signal intensity on DWI images in keeping with bone metastases were delineated to derive total diffusion volume (tDV); five target lesions were also evaluated. Associations of changes in volume of bone metastases and median apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) with response to treatment were assessed by using the Mann-Whitney test and logistic regression; correlation with prostate-specific antigen level and circulating tumor cell count were assessed by using Spearman correlation (r). Results Twenty-one patients were included. All six responders to olaparib showed a decrease in tDV, while no decrease was observed in all nonresponders; this difference between responders and nonresponders was significant (P = .001). Increases in median ADC were associated with increased odds of response (odds ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00, 1.15; P = .04). A positive association was detected between changes in tDV and best percentage change in prostate-specific antigen level and circulating tumor cell count (r = 0.63 [95% CI: 0.27, 0.83] and r = 0.77 [95% CI: 0.51, 0.90], respectively). When assessing five target lesions, decreases in volume were associated with response (odds ratio for volume increase, 0.89; 95% CI: 0.80, 0.99; P = .037). Conclusion This pilot study showed that decreases in volume and increases in median ADC of bone metastases assessed with whole-body DWI can potentially be used as indicators of response to olaparib in mCRPC.

        "Background There is significant pulmonary functional deficit related to obesity, but no prospective CT studies have evaluated the effects of obesity on the lungs and trachea. Purpose To evaluate lung parenchymal and tracheal CT morphology before and 6 months after bariatric surgery, with functional and symptomatic correlation. Materials and Methods A prospective longitudinal study of 51 consecutive individuals referred for bariatric surgery was performed (from November 2011 to November 2013). All individuals had undergone limited (three-location) inspiratory and end-expiratory thoracic CT before and after surgery, with concurrent pulmonary function testing, body mass index calculation, and modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale and Epworth scoring. Two thoracic radiologists scored the CT extent of mosaic attenuation, end-expiratory air trapping, and tracheal shape. The inspiratory and end-expiratory cross-sectional areas of the trachea were measured. The paired t test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for pre- and postsurgical comparisons. Spearman correlation and logistic regression were used to evaluate correlations between CT findings and functional and symptom indexes. Results A total of 51 participants (mean age, 52 years \u00b1 8 [standard deviation]; 20 men) were evaluated. Before surgery, air trapping extent correlated most strongly with decreased total lung capacity (Spearman rank correlation coefficient [rs] = -0.40, P = .004). After surgery, there were decreases in percentage mosaic attenuation (0% [interquartile range {IQR}: 0%\u20132.5%] vs 0% [IQR: 0%\u20130%], P < .001), air trapping (9.6% [IQR: 5.8%\u201315.8%] vs 2.5% [IQR: 0%\u20136.7%], P < .001), and tracheal collapse (201 mm2 [IQR: 181\u2013239 mm2] vs 229 mm2 [186\u2013284 mm2], P < .001). After surgery, mMRC dyspnea score change correlated positively with air trapping extent change (rs = 0.46, P = .001) and end-expiratory tracheal shape change (rs = 0.40, P = .01). At multivariable analysis, air trapping was the main determinant for decreased dyspnea after surgery (odds ratio, 1.2; 95% confidence interval: 1.1, 1.2; P = .03). Conclusion Dyspnea improved in obese participants after weight reduction, which correlated with less tracheal collapse and air trapping at end-expiration chest CT. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "History A 65-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 1-week history of constipation, which was associated with increasing abdominal distention and not passing flatus. Four weeks prior to the current admission he had been diagnosed with metastatic primary adenocarcinoma of the appendix. One week ago, he had been hospitalized with small-bowel obstruction, for which he required laparotomy and loop ileostomy. His medical history included basal cell carcinoma, rheumatoid arthritis, and Barrett esophagus. Physical examination revealed a distended abdomen with tenderness at palpation within the right upper quadrant and lower abdomen and reduced bowel sounds at auscultation. Initial plain-film radiography of the abdomen at admission revealed dilated gas-filled small-bowel loops, suggestive of obstruction. His small-bowel obstruction was managed conservatively on this occasion. Nine days after his admission, the patient became unwell and reported a productive cough. He became tachycardic, tachypneic, and hypotensive. Relevant blood tests at this stage revealed a C-reactive protein level of 206 mg/L (normal range, 0\u201310 mg/L), a white blood cell count of 24.5 \u00d7 109/L (normal range, [4.0\u201311.0] \u00d7 109/L), a red blood cell count of 3.39 \u00d7 1012/L (normal range, [4.5\u20135.5] \u00d7 1012/L), a hemoglobin level of 93 g/L (normal range, 130\u2013170 g/L), and a hematocrit level of 0.27 (normal range, 0.4\u20130.5).

        "Purpose To evaluate whether radiomic feature\u2013based magnetic resonance (MR) imaging signatures allow prediction of survival and stratification of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma with improved accuracy compared with that of established clinical and radiologic risk models. Materials and Methods Retrospective evaluation of data was approved by the local ethics committee and informed consent was waived. A total of 119 patients (allocated in a 2:1 ratio to a discovery [n = 79] or validation [n = 40] set) with newly diagnosed glioblastoma were subjected to radiomic feature extraction (12 190 features extracted, including first-order, volume, shape, and texture features) from the multiparametric (contrast material\u2013enhanced T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery imaging sequences) and multiregional (contrast-enhanced and unenhanced) tumor volumes. Radiomic features of patients in the discovery set were subjected to a supervised principal component (SPC) analysis to predict progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) and were validated in the validation set. The performance of a Cox proportional hazards model with the SPC analysis predictor was assessed with C index and integrated Brier scores (IBS, lower scores indicating higher accuracy) and compared with Cox models based on clinical (age and Karnofsky performance score) and radiologic (Gaussian normalized relative cerebral blood volume and apparent diffusion coefficient) parameters. Results SPC analysis allowed stratification based on 11 features of patients in the discovery set into a low- or high-risk group for PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 2.43; P = .002) and OS (HR, 4.33; P < .001), and the results were validated successfully in the validation set for PFS (HR, 2.28; P = .032) and OS (HR, 3.45; P = .004). The performance of the SPC analysis (OS: IBS, 0.149; C index, 0.654; PFS: IBS, 0.138; C index, 0.611) was higher compared with that of the radiologic (OS: IBS, 0.175; C index, 0.603; PFS: IBS, 0.149; C index, 0.554) and clinical risk models (OS: IBS, 0.161, C index, 0.640; PFS: IBS, 0.139; C index, 0.599). The performance of the SPC analysis model was further improved when combined with clinical data (OS: IBS, 0.142; C index, 0.696; PFS: IBS, 0.132; C index, 0.637). Conclusion An 11-feature radiomic signature that allows prediction of survival and stratification of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma was identified, and improved performance compared with that of established clinical and radiologic risk models was demonstrated. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To evaluate the effect of changes in hematocrit level on myocardial extracellular volume (ECV) fraction, as quantified with cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in an animal model. Materials and Methods Thirteen adult male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent cardiac MR imaging before and after induction of anemia. MR imaging procedures, including unenhanced and contrast material\u2013enhanced T1 mapping, were performed by using a saturation recovery Look-Locker sequence with a 9.4-T unit. An optimized T1 mapping sequence was established in the phantom study. Systolic function of the left ventricle (LV) was calculated from the cine images. Native and postcontrast T1 values of the LV myocardium at the midcavity level and LV blood pool, partition coefficients, and ECV were calculated. Histopathologic examination of the heart was performed after sacrifice. Intergroup comparison of variables was performed with the paired t test. Results The postanemia models exhibited lower hematocrit levels, postcontrast T1 values of the LV pool, and partition coefficients (mean, 45.7% \u00b1 5.2 [standard deviation]; 563.8 msec \u00b1 155.7; and 29.2 \u00b1 3.5, respectively) than did the preanemia models (mean, 59.0% \u00b1 4.1; 690.2 msec \u00b1 109.7; and 38.2 \u00b1 4.4, respectively) (P < .05 for all comparisons). There were no differences between the pre- and postanemia groups in terms of LV ejection fraction (mean, 72.7% \u00b1 2.1 vs 73.2% \u00b1 4.7; P = .78) and ECV (mean, 15.5% \u00b1 2.0 vs 16.0% \u00b1 1.9; P = .24). Conclusion Myocardial ECV measured with contrast-enhanced T1 mapping cardiac MR imaging did not significantly change despite changes in hematocrit level in anemic rat models. Extrapolation of this finding from animal models to human subjects suggests that ECV measured with MR imaging could be a robust parameter in anemic patients. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To detect adoptively transferred immune attack in a mouse model of islet cell transplantation by using a long-circulating paramagnetic T1 contrast agent, a protected graft copolymer (PGC) that is covalently linked to gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Gd-DTPA-F), which accumulates in the sites of inflammation that are characterized by vascular disruption.All animal experiments were performed in compliance with institutional guidelines and approved by the subcommittee on research animal care. Six nonobese diabetic severe combined immunodeficiency mice received transplanted human islet cells under the kidney capsule and adoptively transferred 5 \u00d7 10(6) splenocytes from 6-week-old nonobese diabetic mice. These mice also served as control subjects for comparison of pre- and postadoptive transfer MR imaging results. Mice that received phosphate-buffered saline solution only were included as nonadoptive-transfer control subjects (n = 2). In vivo magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed before and 17 hours after intravenous injections of PGC-Gd-DTPA-F, followed by histologic examination. Statistical differences were analyzed by means of a paired Student t test and repeated two-way analysis of variance.MR imaging results showed significantly greater accumulation of PGC-Gd-DTPA-F in the graft area after immune attack initiated by adoptive transfer of splenocytes compared with that of the same area before the transfer (T1, 137.2 msec \u00b1 39.3 and 239.5 msec \u00b1 17.6, respectively; P < .001). These results were confirmed at histologic examination, which showed considerable leakage of the contrast agent into the islet cell interstitium.PGC-Gd-DTPA-F-enhanced MR imaging allows for the in vivo assessment of vascular damage of the graft T cell challenge.",
        "Background Renal impairment is common in patients with coronary artery disease and, if severe, late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging for myocardial infarction (MI) evaluation cannot be performed. Purpose To develop a fully automatic framework for chronic MI delineation via deep learning on non\u2013contrast material\u2013enhanced cardiac cine MRI. Materials and Methods In this retrospective single-center study, a deep learning model was developed to extract motion features from the left ventricle and delineate MI regions on nonenhanced cardiac cine MRI collected between October 2015 and March 2017. Patients with chronic MI, as well as healthy control patients, had both nonenhanced cardiac cine (25 phases per cardiac cycle) and LGE MRI examinations. Eighty percent of MRI examinations were used for the training data set and 20% for the independent testing data set. Chronic MI regions on LGE MRI were defined as ground truth. Diagnostic performance was assessed by analysis of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). MI area and MI area percentage from nonenhanced cardiac cine and LGE MRI were compared by using the Pearson correlation, paired t test, and Bland-Altman analysis. Results Study participants included 212 patients with chronic MI (men, 171; age, 57.2 years \u00b1 12.5) and 87 healthy control patients (men, 42; age, 43.3 years \u00b1 15.5). Using the full cardiac cine MRI, the per-segment sensitivity and specificity for detecting chronic MI in the independent test set was 89.8% and 99.1%, respectively, with an AUC of 0.94. There were no differences between nonenhanced cardiac cine and LGE MRI analyses in number of MI segments (114 vs 127, respectively; P = .38), per-patient MI area (6.2 cm2 \u00b1 2.8 vs 5.5 cm2 \u00b1 2.3, respectively; P = .27; correlation coefficient, r = 0.88), and MI area percentage (21.5% \u00b1 17.3 vs 18.5% \u00b1 15.4; P = .17; correlation coefficient, r = 0.89). Conclusion The proposed deep learning framework on nonenhanced cardiac cine MRI enables the confirmation (presence), detection (position), and delineation (transmurality and size) of chronic myocardial infarction. However, future larger-scale multicenter studies are required for a full validation. Published under a CC BY 4.0 license. Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Purpose To evaluate the feasibility of percutaneous isolated pancreas perfusion (PIPP) by using a pig model. Materials and Methods All experiments were approved by the institutional Animal Experiment Ethics Committee. Fifteen pigs were assigned to five groups, and PIPP was performed. Angiographic and dye injection studies were performed to confirm the patency of the PIPP system (group 1). Blood that contained cisplatin (1.5 mg per kilogram of body weight) in an extracorporeal circuit was circulated through the pancreas at three infusion rates (40, 60, and 80 mL/min) to determine the optimal infusion rate in terms of safety and pharmacologic effectiveness (groups 2, 3, and 4, respectively). Chronological laboratory data and histologic findings were assessed in group 5, which received the optimal infusion rate. Maximum platinum concentration (Cmax) and area under the platinum concentration\u2013time curve were compared by using the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests. Results Angiography and dye injection confirmed the patency of the PIPP system. Histopathologic examinations showed no abnormalities in the pancreas or other organs at a 40 mL/min infusion rate of cisplatin. However, edematous changes in the pancreas were observed at higher infusion rates. The pharmacologic effectiveness did not differ significantly among groups; therefore, the optimal infusion rate of 40 mL/min was selected. The median pancreatic-to-systemic exposure ratios were 71.8 for Cmax and 54.8 for the area under the curve. All laboratory data remained normal or returned to pretreatment levels within 1 week. Conclusion PIPP at a 40 mL/min infusion rate appears to be safe and feasible for perfusion of the pancreas. \u00a9 RSNA, 2015",
        "To assess whether architectural alterations exist in the white matter of patients with syndromic and complex craniosynostosis.The medical ethics committee approved this study. Written informed consent was obtained from parents or guardians before imaging. A prospective study was performed in children with syndromic and complex craniosynostosis aged 6-14 years. Forty-five patients were included: four had Apert syndrome, 14 had Crouzon-Pfeiffer syndrome, eight had Muenke syndrome, 11 had Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, and eight had complex craniosynostosis. In addition, seven control subjects were evaluated. For diffusion-tensor imaging, an echo-planar sequence was used with a diffusion gradient (b = 1000 sec/mm(2)) applied in 25 noncollinear directions. Regions of interest (ROIs) were placed in the following white matter structures: pontine crossing tract, corticospinal tracts, medial cerebral peduncles, uncinate fasciculus (measured bilaterally), anterior commissure, frontal and occipital white matter (measured bilaterally), fornix, corpus callosum (measured in the genu and splenium), and corpus cingulum (measured bilaterally). Eigenvalues were measured in all ROIs and fractional anisotropy (FA) was calculated.Across all measured ROIs, FA values were generally lower in all patients combined than in the control subjects (P < .001). There were no significant differences among subgroups of patients.Diffusion-tensor imaging measurements of white matter tracts reveal significant white matter integrity differences between children with craniosynostosis and healthy control subjects. This could imply that the developmental delays seen in these patients could be caused by the presence of a primary disorder of the white matter microarchitecture.",
        "The image biomarker standardisation initiative (IBSI) is an independent international collaboration which works towards standardising the extraction of image biomarkers from acquired imaging for the purpose of high-throughput quantitative image analysis (radiomics). Lack of reproducibility and validation of high-throughput quantitative image analysis studies is considered to be a major challenge for the field. Part of this challenge lies in the scantiness of consensus-based guidelines and definitions for the process of translating acquired imaging into high-throughput image biomarkers. The IBSI therefore seeks to provide image biomarker nomenclature and definitions, benchmark data sets, and benchmark values to verify image processing and image biomarker calculations, as well as reporting guidelines, for high-throughput image analysis.",
        "Purpose To determine whether changes in coronary opacification normalized to the aorta (corrected coronary opacification [CCO]) across stents can help identify in-stent restenosis (ISR) severity with use of invasive coronary angiography as the standard of reference. Materials and Methods This study was approved by the institutional review board, and the requirement to obtain informed consent was waived. The authors retrospectively analyzed 106 patients (88 men, 18 women; mean age, 59.6 years \u00b1 10.4; age range, 36\u201384 years) who had previously undergone stent implantation within 3 months of coronary computed tomographic (CT) angiography. Attenuation values in the coronary lumen were measured proximal and distal to the stents and normalized to the descending aorta. The CCO difference across the stent was compared with the severity of ISR. One-way analysis of variance least significant difference was used for comparison. Results A total of 141 stents were assessed. Seventy-six stents were normally patent, 18 had ISR of less than 50%, 28 had ISR of 50%\u201399%, and 19 were fully occluded. The median CCO differences in the four groups were 0.078, 0.163, 0.346, and 0.606, respectively. There was no significant difference between stents with an ISR of at least 50% and those with total occlusion (P = .056), although the other groups had significant differences at pairwise comparison (P < .01 for all). For stents smaller than 3 mm in diameter, the median CCO differences in the four groups were 0.086, 0.136, 0.390, and 0.471, respectively. The CCO differences across normal stents and stents with ISR of less than 50% were significantly less than those across stents with an ISR of at least 50% and those with total occlusion (P < .01 for all). There were no significant differences between stents with no ISR and those with an ISR of less than 50% (P = .821) and between stents with an ISR of at least 50% and those with an ISR of 100% (P = .836). Conclusion The CCO difference across coronary stents is related to ISR severity in obstructive ISR in stents smaller than 3 mm in diameter. \u00a9 RSNA, 2014",
        "To evaluate the diagnostic performance of contrast material-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) angiography for preoperative detection and localization of accessory pudendal arteries (APAs) in patients with prostate cancer.This prospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained. Between July 2007 and December 2010, 127 patients underwent contrast-enhanced MR angiography following prostate MR imaging at 3.0 T before robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP). APAs were defined as any arteries located in the periprostatic region and anastomosed with the common penile artery or its branches; they were then subclassified into lateral and apical APAs. For detecting and localizing APAs, MR angiograms were evaluated prospectively by one reader and retrospectively by two independent blinded readers. Diagnostic performance was determined on a per-patient basis by using surgical findings as the reference standard. In addition, the origin of APAs identified at both surgery and contrast-enhanced MR angiography was determined by consensus of two retrospective readers. Interreader agreements were assessed by using k statistics.At surgery, 19 APAs (seven right apical, three left apical, four right lateral, and five left lateral) were detected in 16 patients, and 16 of these APAs were localized in 13 patients at preoperative contrast-enhanced MR angiography. Prospectively, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of contrast-enhanced MR angiography for the localization of APAs were 81.3%, 93.7%, and 92.1%, while retrospectively they were 87.5%, 91.9%, and 91.3% for reader 2 and 75.0%, 90.1%, and 88.2% for reader 3, respectively. Overall interreader agreement was substantial (k = 0.795). Nine and seven APAs originated from the obturator artery and the inferior vesical artery, respectively.Contrast-enhanced MR angiography can be used for the preoperative detection of APAs in patients with prostate cancer.",
        "Background Trends in the detection of suspicious microcalcifications at mammography screening and the yield of these lesions after recall are unknown. Purpose To determine trends in recall and outcome of screen-detected microcalcifications during 20 years of mammography screening. Materials and Methods The authors performed a retrospective analysis of a consecutive series of 817 656 screening examinations (January 1997 to January 2017) in a national breast screening program. In 2009-2010 (transition period), screen-film mammography (SFM) was gradually replaced by full-field digital mammography (FFDM). The recalls of suspicious microcalcifications from all radiology reports and pathologic outcome of recalled women with 2-year follow-up were analyzed. Screening outcome in the era of SFM (1997-2008), the transition period (2009-2010), and the era of FFDM (2011-2016) were compared. Trends over time and variations between the SFM and FFDM periods were expressed by using proportions with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). In cases where the analysis based on the CI confirmed clear periods (eg, before and after introduction of FFDM), pre- and postchange outcomes were compared by using \u03c72 tests. Results A total of 18 592 women (median age, 59 years; interquartile range, 14 years) were recalled at mammography screening, 3556 of whom had suspicious microcalcifications. The recall rate for microcalcifications increased from 0.1% in 1997-1998 to 0.5% in 2015-2016 (P < .001). This was temporally associated with the change from SFM to FFDM. The recalls yielding ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) increased from 0.3 per 1000 screening examinations with SFM to 1.1 per 1000 screening examinations with FFDM (P < .001), resulting in a decrease in the positive predictive value for recall for suspicious microcalcifications from 51% to 33% (P < .001). More than half of all DCIS lesions were high grade (52.6%; 393 of 747). The distribution of DCIS grades was stable during the 20-year screening period (P = .36). Conclusion The recall rate for suspicious microcalcifications at mammographic screening increased during the past 2 decades, whereas the ductal carcinoma in situ detection rate increased less rapidly, resulting in a lower positive predictive value for recall. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020.",
        "Background Cervical spine CT is regularly performed to exclude cervical spine injury during the initial evaluation of trauma patients. Patients with asymmetry of the lateral atlantodental interval (LADI) often undergo subsequent MRI to rule out ligamentous injuries. The clinical relevance of an asymmetric LADI and the benefit of additional MRI remain unclear. Purpose To evaluate the diagnostic benefit of additional MRI in patients with blunt trauma who have asymmetry of the LADI and no other cervical injuries. Materials and Methods Patients who underwent cervical spine CT during initial trauma evaluation between March 2017 and August 2019 were retrospectively evaluated. Those who underwent subsequent MRI because of LADI asymmetry of 1 mm or greater with no other signs of cervical injury were identified and reevaluated by two readers blinded to clinical data and initial study reports regarding possible ligamentous injuries. Results Among 1553 patients, 146 (9%) had LADI asymmetry of 1 mm or greater. Of these, 46 patients (mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 39 years \u00b1 22; 28 men; median LADI asymmetry, 2.4 mm [interquartile range, 1.8-3.1 mm]) underwent supplementary MRI with no other signs of cervical injury at initial CT. Ten of the 46 patients (22%) showed cervical tenderness at clinical examination, and 36 patients (78%) were asymptomatic. In two of the 46 patients (4%), MRI revealed alar ligament injury; both of these patients showed LADI asymmetry greater than 3 mm, along with cervical tenderness at clinical examination, and underwent treatment for ligamentous injury. In 13 of the 46 patients (28%), signal intensity alterations of alar ligaments without signs of rupture were observed. Four of these 13 patients (31%) were subsequently treated for ligamentous injury despite being asymptomatic. Conclusion Subsequent MRI following CT of the cervical spine in trauma patients with lateral atlantodental interval asymmetry may have diagnostic benefit only in symptomatic patients. In asymptomatic patients without proven cervical injuries, subsequent MRI showed no diagnostic benefit and may even lead to overtreatment. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Background Chest radiography has not been validated for its prognostic utility in evaluating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Purpose To analyze the prognostic value of a chest radiograph severity scoring system for younger (nonelderly) patients with COVID-19 at initial presentation to the emergency department (ED); outcomes of interest included hospitalization, intubation, prolonged stay, sepsis, and death. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, patients between the ages of 21 and 50 years who presented to the ED of an urban multicenter health system from March 10 to March 26, 2020, with COVID-19 confirmation on real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction were identified. Each patient's ED chest radiograph was divided into six zones and examined for opacities by two cardiothoracic radiologists, and scores were collated into a total concordant lung zone severity score. Clinical and laboratory variables were collected. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship between clinical parameters, chest radiograph scores, and patient outcomes. Results The study included 338 patients: 210 men (62%), with median age of 39 years (interquartile range, 31\u201345 years). After adjustment for demographics and comorbidities, independent predictors of hospital admission (n = 145, 43%) were chest radiograph severity score of 2 or more (odds ratio, 6.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.5, 11; P < .001) and obesity (odds ratio, 2.4 [95% CI: 1.1, 5.4] or morbid obesity). Among patients who were admitted, a chest radiograph score of 3 or more was an independent predictor of intubation (n = 28) (odds ratio, 4.7; 95% CI: 1.8, 13; P = .002) as was hospital site. No significant difference was found in primary outcomes across race and ethnicity or those with a history of tobacco use, asthma, or diabetes mellitus type II. Conclusion For patients aged 21\u201350 years with coronavirus disease 2019 presenting to the emergency department, a chest radiograph severity score was predictive of risk for hospital admission and intubation. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Background Tumor perfusion may inform therapeutic response and resistance in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) treated with antiangiogenic therapy. Purpose To determine if arterial spin labeled (ASL) MRI perfusion changes are associated with tumor response and disease progression in metastatic RCC treated with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Materials and Methods In this prospective study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00749320), metastatic RCC perfusion was measured with ASL MRI before and during sunitinib or pazopanib therapy between October 2008 and March 2014. Objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) were calculated. Perfusion was compared between responders and nonresponders at baseline, at week 2, after cycle 2 (12 weeks), after cycle 4 (24 weeks), and at disease progression and compared with the ORR by using the Wilcoxon rank sum test and with PFS by using the log-rank test. Results Seventeen participants received sunitinib (mean age, 59 years \u00b1 7.0 [standard deviation]; 11 men); 11 participants received pazopanib (mean age, 63 years \u00b1 6.6; eight men). Responders had higher baseline tumor perfusion than nonresponders (mean, 404 mL/100 g/min \u00b1 213 vs 199 mL/100 g/min \u00b1 136; P = .02). Perfusion decreased from baseline to week 2 (-53 mL/100 g/min \u00b1 31; P < .001), after cycle 2 (-65 mL/100 g/min \u00b1 25; P < .001), and after cycle 4 (-79 mL/100 g/min \u00b1 15; P = .008). Interval reduction in perfusion at those three time points was not associated with ORR (P = .63, .29, and .27, respectively) or PFS (P = .28, .27, and .32). Perfusion increased from cycle 4 to disease progression (51% \u00b1 11; P < .001). Conclusion Arterial spin labeled perfusion MRI may assist in identifying responders to vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors and may help detect early evidence of disease progression in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Purpose To identify differences in radiologic assessment methods and determine optimal imaging criteria for response evaluation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients treated with chemoembolization. Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval was obtained, and patient informed consent was waived. The present study included 332 patients with intermediate stage HCC and Child-Pugh A cirrhosis who underwent serial chemoembolization. All measurable target lesions of 1 cm or larger in diameter were uni- and bidimensionally measured both at baseline and during follow-up. Intermodel agreement among the guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO), Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), and modified RECIST (mRECIST) were examined. The most reliable model was selected on the basis of the correlation with survival prediction. Results The \u03ba values of comparisons among WHO, RECIST, and mRECIST guidelines were less than 0.20, whereas the \u03ba value for the comparison of EASL and mRECIST guidelines was 0.94. In patients with a partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD), compared with patients with a complete response (CR), hazard ratios (HRs) for survival were 2.99 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.14, 4.17), 3.49 (95% CI: 1.71, 7.10), and 15.63 (95% CI: 9.51, 25.69), respectively, for EASL criteria. In patients with a PR, SD, or PD, compared with patients with a CR, the HRs were 2.75 (95% CI: 1.96, 3.87), 6.32 (95% CI: 3.67, 10.90), and 16.06 (95% CI: 9.76, 26.43), respectively, for mRECIST guidelines (P < .001). The C index for the multivariate model was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.79) for both EASL and mRECIST guidelines, thus exhibiting satisfactory capability to help predict survival. The Cox regression model revealed that both mRECIST and EASL guidelines were independent predictors of overall survival (P < .001 for both). Conclusion The enhancement models more accurately helped predict long-term survival in HCC patients treated with chemoembolization. \u00a9 RSNA, 2011",
        "Purpose To evaluate the diagnostic potential of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM)\u2013derived parameters for differentiation of common pancreatic tumors, chronic pancreatitis, and normal pancreas and for characterization of the malignancy potential of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs). Materials and Methods The institutional review board approved this retrospective study, and informed consent was waived. Ninety-three consecutive patients with surgically resected and pathologically confirmed pancreatic tumors (39 pancreatic adenocarcinomas [PACs], 17 neuroendocrine tumors [NETs], and 37 IPMNs), seven patients with chronic pancreatitis, and 26 patients with a normal pancreas were included in this study. All patients underwent pancreatic 3.0-T magnetic resonance imaging, including IVIM diffusion-weighted imaging with 10 b values used (from 0 to 1000 sec/mm2). The ADC, slow component of diffusion (Dslow), incoherent microcirculation (Dfast), and perfusion fraction (f) were calculated. Steel-Dwass and Mann-Whitney U tests were used for comparison. The diagnostic performance of the parameters was evaluated by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis with Bonferroni correction. Results Among ADC- and IVIM-derived parameters, Dfast and f values of PACs were significantly lower than those of normal pancreas, chronic pancreatitis, and NETs (all P < .05 in post hoc analyses). For differentiation of PACs from NETs, f and Dfast showed a significant difference (P < .0001 for both) and were more useful parameters than ADC and Dslow in ROC analysis (all P < .05). Malignant IPMNs had significantly lower ADC and Dslow values and higher Dfast and f values when compared with benign IPMNs (all P < .05). In ROC analysis, f showed the highest area under the ROC curve value for distinguishing malignant from benign IPMNs. Conclusion IVIM-derived perfusion-related parameters could be helpful for the differentiation of common malignant tumors in the pancreas and for distinguishing malignant from benign IPMNs. Dfast and f were more valuable parameters in the differentiation of PACs from NETs than were ADC and Dslow. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Background In the first (prevalent) supplemental MRI screening round of the Dense Tissue and Early Breast Neoplasm Screening (DENSE) trial, a considerable number of breast cancers were found at the cost of an increased false-positive rate (FPR). In incident screening rounds, a lower cancer detection rate (CDR) is expected due to a smaller pool of prevalent cancers, and a reduced FPR, due to the availability of prior MRI examinations. Purpose To investigate screening performance indicators of the second round (incidence round) of the DENSE trial. Materials and Methods The DENSE trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01315015) is embedded within the Dutch population-based biennial mammography screening program for women aged 50-75 years. MRI examinations were performed between December 2011 and January 2016. Women were eligible for the second round when they again had a negative screening mammogram 2 years after their first MRI. The recall rate, biopsy rate, CDR, FPR, positive predictive values, and distributions of tumor characteristics were calculated and compared with results of the first round using 95% CIs and \u03c72 tests. Results A total of 3436 women (median age, 56 years; interquartile range, 48-64 years) underwent a second MRI screening. The CDR was 5.8 per 1000 screening examinations (95% CI: 3.8, 9.0) compared with 16.5 per 1000 screening examinations (95% CI: 13.3, 20.5) in the first round. The FPR was 26.3 per 1000 screening examinations (95% CI: 21.5, 32.3) in the second round versus 79.8 per 1000 screening examinations (95% CI: 72.4, 87.9) in the first round. The positive predictive value for recall was 18% (20 of 110 participants recalled; 95% CI: 12.1, 26.4), and the positive predictive value for biopsy was 24% (20 of 84 participants who underwent biopsy; 95% CI: 16.0, 33.9), both comparable to that of the first round. All tumors in the second round were stage 0-I and node negative. Conclusion The incremental cancer detection rate in the second round was 5.8 per 1000 screening examinations-compared with 16.5 per 1000 screening examinations in the first round. This was accompanied by a strong reduction in the number of false-positive results. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "To investigate the association between radiologist interpretive volume and diagnostic mammography performance in community-based settings.This study received institutional review board approval and was HIPAA compliant. A total of 117,136 diagnostic mammograms that were interpreted by 107 radiologists between 2002 and 2006 in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium were included. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the adjusted effect on sensitivity and the rates of false-positive findings and cancer detection of four volume measures: annual diagnostic volume, screening volume, total volume, and diagnostic focus (percentage of total volume that is diagnostic). Analyses were stratified by the indication for imaging: additional imaging after screening mammography or evaluation of a breast concern or problem.Diagnostic volume was associated with sensitivity; the odds of a true-positive finding rose until a diagnostic volume of 1000 mammograms was reached; thereafter, they either leveled off (P < .001 for additional imaging) or decreased (P = .049 for breast concerns or problems) with further volume increases. Diagnostic focus was associated with false-positive rate; the odds of a false-positive finding increased until a diagnostic focus of 20% was reached and decreased thereafter (P < .024 for additional imaging and P < .001 for breast concerns or problems with no self-reported lump). Neither total volume nor screening volume was consistently associated with diagnostic performance.Interpretive volume and diagnostic performance have complex multifaceted relationships. Our results suggest that diagnostic interpretive volume is a key determinant in the development of thresholds for considering a diagnostic mammogram to be abnormal. Current volume regulations do not distinguish between screening and diagnostic mammography, and doing so would likely be challenging.",
        "A 27-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department with fever and thoracic pain. In the previous 6 months, the patient lost a substantial amount of weight (12 kg). His family history was negative for cardiac disease. Electrocardiography revealed sinus rhythm, and diffuse T-wave inversion. Two-dimensional echocardiography was performed (Fig 1) and revealed normal left systolic function (ejection fraction, 60%). Laboratory tests showed elevated levels of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (1.07 ng/mL; normal value, <0.015 ng/mL), high levels of C-reactive protein (16 mg/dL; normal range, 0-5 mg/dL), and leukocytosis with an eosinophilia level of 8710/\u03bcL (normal level, <400/\u03bcL). Parasitic and infectious diseases (Toxocara canis, strongyloides, filariasis, cysticercosis, fasciola, trichinella, echinococcosis) were excluded based on blood and fecal test results. Corticosteroid therapy was started, and the patient was dismissed. A few days later, he was readmitted to the emergency department with a headache and suddenly blurred vision. Neurologic and ophthalmologic findings were normal, and MRI of the brain was performed (Fig 2). Cardiac MRI (Fig 3) was performed 2 days later and revealed the following quantitative results: (a) left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVDV) of 165 mL (LVDV/body surface area [BSA], 89 mL/m2; normal range, 64-100 mL/m2), left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVSV) of 80 mL (LVSV/BSA, 43 mL/m2; normal range, 17-39 mL/m2); stroke volume (SV) of 85 mL (SV/BSA, 46 mL/m2; normal range, 43-67 mL/m2); and ejection fraction of 52% and (b) right ventricular end-diastolic volume (RVDV) of 163 mL (RVDV/BSA, 88 mL/m2; normal range, 63-111 mL/m2), right ventricular end-systolic volume (RVSV) of 81 mL (RVSV/BSA, 44 mL/m2; normal range, 32-92 mL/m2); stroke volume (SV) of 82 mL (SV/BSA, 44 mL/m2; normal range, 39-71 mL/m2); and ejection fraction of 50%.",
        "To determine performance and utilization of screening breast ultrasonography (US) in women with dense breast tissue who underwent additional screening breast US in the 1st year since implementation of Connecticut Public Act 09-41 requiring radiologists to inform patients with heterogeneous or extremely dense breasts at mammography that they may benefit from such examination.Informed consent was waived for this institutional review board-approved, HIPAA-compliant retrospective review of 935 women with dense breasts at mammography who subsequently underwent handheld screening and whole-breast US from October 1, 2009, through September 30, 2010.Of 935 women, 614 (65.7%) were at low risk, 149 (15.9%) were at intermediate risk, and 87 (9.3%) were at high risk for breast cancer. Of the screening breast US examinations, in 701 (75.0%), results were classified as Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) category 1 or 2; in 187 (20.0%), results were classified as BI-RADS category 3; and in 47 (5.0%), results were classified as BI-RADS category 4. Of 63 aspirations or biopsies recommended and performed in 53 patients, in nine, lesions were BI-RADS category 3, and in 54, lesions were BI-RADS category 4. Among 63 biopsies and aspirations, three lesions were malignant (all BI-RADS category 4, diagnosed with biopsy). All three cancers were smaller than 1 cm, were found in postmenopausal patients, and were solid masses. One cancer was found in each risk group. In 44 of 935 (4.7%) patients, examination results were false-positive. Overall positive predictive value (PPV) for biopsy or aspirations performed in patients with BI-RADS category 4 masses was 6.5% (three of 46; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7%, 19%). Overall cancer detection rate was 3.2 cancers per 1000 women screened (three of 935; 95% CI: 0.8 cancers per 1000 women screened, 10 cancers per 1000 women screened).Technologist-performed handheld screening breast US offered to women in the general population with dense breasts can aid detection of small mammographically occult breast cancers (cancer detection rate, 0.8-10 cancers per 1000 women screened), although the overall PPV is low.",
        "Background SARS-CoV-2 targets angiotensin-converting enzyme 2\u2013expressing cells in the respiratory tract. There are reports of breathlessness in patients many months after infection. Purpose To determine whether hyperpolarized xenon 129 MRI (XeMRI) imaging could be used to identify the possible cause of breathlessness in patients at 3 months after hospital discharge following COVID-19 infection. Materials and Methods This prospective study was undertaken between August and December of 2020, with patients and healthy control volunteers being enrolled. All patients underwent lung function tests; ventilation and dissolved-phase XeMRI, with the mean red blood cell (RBC) to tissue or plasma (TP) ratio being calculated; and a low-dose chest CT, with scans being scored for the degree of abnormalities after COVID-19. Healthy control volunteers underwent XeMRI. The intraclass correlation coefficient was calculated for volunteer and patient scans to assess repeatability. A Wilcoxon rank sum test and Cohen effect size calculation were performed to assess differences in the RBC/TP ratio between patients and control volunteers. Results Nine patients (mean age, 57 years \u00b1 7 [standard deviation]; six male patients) and five volunteers (mean age, 29 years \u00b1 3; five female volunteers) were enrolled. The mean time from hospital discharge for patients was 169 days (range, 116\u2013254 days). There was a difference in the RBC/TP ratio between patients and control volunteers (0.3 \u00b1 0.1 vs 0.5 \u00b1 0.1, respectively; P = .001; effect size, 1.36). There was significant difference between the RBC and gas phase spectral full width at half maximum between volunteers and patients (median \u00b1 range, 567 \u00b1 1 vs 507 \u00b1 81 [P = .002] and 104 \u00b1 2 vs 122 \u00b1 17 [P = .004], respectively). Results were reproducible, with intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.82 and 0.88 being demonstrated for patients and volunteers, respectively. Participants had normal or nearly normal CT scans (mean, seven of 25; range, zero of 25 to 10 of 25). Conclusion Hyperpolarized xenon 129 MRI results showed alveolar capillary diffusion limitation in all nine patients after COVID-19 pneumonia, despite normal or nearly normal results at CT. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 See also the editorial by Dietrich in this issue.",
        "To evaluate tumor response by means of volumetric assessment, survival, and changes in patient symptoms after the treatment of unresectable and/or recurrent pleural mesothelioma by using regional nonselective transarterial chemoperfusion as a palliative treatment option.This retrospective study was approved by the hospital ethical committee, and all patients signed an informed consent prior to treatment. Thirty-nine patients (mean age, 64.0 years; 10 women and 29 men) with unresectable pleural mesothelioma were treated with repetitive transarterial chemoperfusion between March 2007 and March 2010, with a mean of 2.9 sessions per patient at 4-week intervals. Transarterial chemoperfusion was performed by using mitomycin C, cisplatin, and gemcitabine. Computed tomography findings and patient symptoms were evaluated. Tumor response was evaluated by using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors guidelines, and survival was assessed with the Kaplan-Meier method. The change in volume for the partial-response group was tested by using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.In 36% of treated tumors (14 of 39), partial response was achieved, and tumor volume decreased from a mean value \u00b1 standard deviation of 839.6 mL \u00b1 590.3 (range, 3.9-1972.2 mL) to 137 mL \u00b1 399.8 (range, 0.88-1131.4; P = .00012). In 49% of tumors (19 of 39), stable disease was noted. In 15% of tumors (six of 39), progressive disease was seen. Mean specific growth rate of the tumor was 0.00158% per day. The mean survival time was 14.2 months (range, 2.1-33.1 months) from the start of treatment. For patients with tumors that responded to treatment, mean survival time was 15 months (range, 4.5-33.1 months). Mean time to disease progression was 2.6 months for all tumors, 1.5 months for stable disease, and 1.3 months for progressive disease.Transarterial chemoperfusion may have the potential to yield positive results and response in the treatment of recurrent and/or unresectable pleural mesothelioma. \u00a9 RSNA, 2012.",
        "INTRODUCTION: Mammographic density is a strong predictor of breast cancer. The mammographic breast pattern in all age groups is of great significance in the effort to understand the changes in breast pattern in pathological processes, and diseases prevalent in such age groups. It is also very important as the basis for national policy on breast diseases. Menopause has a significant effect on breast pattern and it is documented to have more important influence on the decline in mammographic densities than age. Breast changes in postmenopausal women are also affected by parity, positive family history of breast cancer and race. This study therefore aimed to describe the breast parenchymal pattern in post menopausal women. The study using ACR BIRADS Category has also correlated the socio-demographic and anthropometric characteristics with the described breast pattern.\r\nMETHODOLOGY: This is a retrospective descriptive study carried out in the Radiology Department of the University College Hospital Ibadan. The mammograms of 196 postmenopausal women which were reported by two experienced breast radiologists in the Department were retrieved and reviewed by the author. The BI-RADS breast parenchymal pattern was classified by the author into two groups, 1and2, and 3and4 for analysis to improve the sensitivity of the result from the small sample size. The final BI-RADS categories were also classified into 0, 1 \u2013 2, 3 \u2013 4 and 5 \u2013 6 groups for the samereason. The report of the mammograms were matched with patients\u2019 data and enteredinto R statistical package for analysis. Chi-square statistical test was used to assess the difference in proportion between these groups and the categorical variables. The p- value was set at 0.05.\r\nRESULTS: The mean age of the women was 55.0\u00b16.8 years and the mean age at menopause was 48.4\u00b14.6 years. The combined BI-RADS 1 and 2 breast parenchymal patterns which are associated with low risk of breast cancer, were found in 82.1% of the study population. The mean age of the women at birth of their first child was 26.12 years. The mean difference in age at first birth between BI-RADS 1and2 and BI-RADS 3and4 was statistically significant p=0.035. Other variables show no significant statistical correlation likely due to the small sample size.\r\nCONCLUSION: The higher percentage of BI-RADS 1 and 2 breast pattern in this study which is associated with lower incidence of breast cancer in African women supports previous publications, as the dense breast is an important singular risk factor for breast cancer. The clustering of low mean age at birth of first child, low mean age at menopause and multiparity, may be responsible for the higher percentage of BI-RADS 1 and 2 breast npatterns in majority of the women in this study. Family and personal history of breast cancer and BMI also correlated with breast pattern; however these were not statistically significant, probably due to the small sample size. Further study with a larger sample size will clarify the statistical significance of these associations.",
        "To investigate the integrity of the default-mode network (DMN) by using independent component analysis (ICA) methods in patients shortly after mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) and healthy control subjects, and to correlate DMN connectivity changes with neurocognitive tests and clinical symptoms.This study was approved by the institutional review board and complied with HIPAA regulations. Twenty-three patients with MTBI who had posttraumatic symptoms shortly after injury (<2 months) and 18 age-matched healthy control subjects were included in this study. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 3 T to characterize the DMN by using ICA methods, including a single-participant ICA on the basis of a comprehensive template from core seeds in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) nodes. ICA z images of DMN components were compared between the two groups and correlated with neurocognitive tests and clinical performance in patients by using Pearson and Spearman rank correlation.When compared with the control subjects, there was significantly reduced connectivity in the PCC and parietal regions and increased frontal connectivity around the MPFC in patients with MTBI (P < .01). These frontoposterior opposing changes within the DMN were significantly correlated (r = -0.44, P = .03). The reduced posterior connectivity correlated positively with neurocognitive dysfunction (eg, cognitive flexibility), while the increased frontal connectivity correlated negatively with posttraumatic symptoms (ie, depression, anxiety, fatigue, and postconcussion syndrome).These results showed abnormal DMN connectivity patterns in patients with MTBI, which may provide insight into how neuronal communication and information integration are disrupted among DMN key structures after mild head injury.",
        "Purpose To evaluate the variation among U.S. hospitals in overall use and yield of in-hospital computed tomographic (CT) pulmonary angiography (PA) in patients undergoing total hip replacement (THR) or total knee replacement (TKR) surgery. Materials and Methods Patients in the Premier Research Database who underwent elective TKR or THR between 2007 and 2011 were enrolled in this HIPAA-compliant, institutional review board-approved retrospective observational study. The informed consent requirement was waived. Hospitals were categorized into low, medium, and high tertiles of CT PA use to compare baseline patient- and hospital-level characteristics and pulmonary embolism (PE) positivity rates. To further investigate between-hospital variation in CT PA use, a hierarchical logistic regression model that included hospital-specific random effects and fixed patient- and hospital-level effects was used. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to measure the amount of variability in CT PA use attributable to between-hospital variation. Results The cohort included 205 198 patients discharged from 178 hospitals (median of 734.5 patients discharged per hospital; interquartile range, 316-1461 patients) with 3647 CT PA studies (1.8%). The crude frequency of CT PA scans among the hospitals ranged from 0% to 6.2% (median, 1.6%); more than 90% of the hospitals performed CT PA in less than 3% of their patients. The mean hospital-level PE positivity rate was 12.3% (median, 9.1%); there was no significant difference in PE positivity rate across low through high CT PA use tertiles (11.3%, 11.9%, 12.9%, P = .37). After adjustment for hospital- and patient-level factors, the remaining amount of interhospital variation was relatively low (ICC, 9.0%). Conclusion Limited interhospital variation in use and yield of in-hospital CT PA was observed among patients undergoing TKR or THR in the United States. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Five cases of axillary lymphadenopathy are presented, which occurred after COVID-19 vaccination and mimicked metastasis in a vulnerable oncologic patient group. Initial radiologic diagnosis raised concerns for metastasis. However, further investigation revealed that patients received COVID-19 vaccinations in the ipsilateral arm prior to imaging. In two cases, lymph node biopsy results confirmed vaccination-related reactive lymphadenopathy. Ipsilateral axillary swelling or lymphadenopathy was reported based on symptoms and physical examination in COVID-19 vaccine trials. Knowledge of the potential for COVID-19 vaccine-related ipsilateral adenopathy is necessary to avoid unnecessary biopsy and change in therapy. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021.",
        "Purpose To evaluate the normal biodistribution and kinetics of (S)-4-(3-[18F]fluoropropyl)-l-glutamic acid ((18)F FSPG) in healthy volunteers and to compare (18)F FSPG mean and maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmean and SUVmax, respectively) with those of (18)F fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) across a variety of organs. Materials and Methods This protocol was reviewed and approved by all appropriate regulatory authorities. An 8-mCi (\u00b110%) dose of (18)F FSPG was given to five subjects (three women, two men), and seven whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) scans were performed 5, 10, 20, 30, 45, 150, and 240 minutes after injection. Regions of interest were analyzed on the resultant (18)F FSPG images to evaluate the kinetics of this radiotracer. The images obtained 45 minutes after injection were used to measure SUVmean and SUVmax in additional regions of the body. These values were compared with similar values obtained with (18)F FDG PET published previously. Descriptive statistics, including average and standard deviation across the five subjects, were used. (18)F FSPG SUVmean and SUVmax were compared. Results On the (18)F FSPG images obtained 45 minutes after injection, there was only low-grade background activity in the majority of analyzed regions. Prominent activity was seen throughout the pancreas. Clearance of the radiotracer through the kidneys and collection in the bladder also were seen. SUV quantification shows notable differences between (18)F FSPG and (18)F FDG in the pancreas ((18)F FSPG SUVmean, 8.2; (18)F FDG SUVmean, 1.3), stomach ((18)F FSPG SUVmax, 3.6; (18)F FDG SUVmax, 1.6), and brain ((18)F FSPG SUVmean, 0.08; (18)F FDG SUVmean, 7.8). The kinetic data showed rapid clearance of the radiotracer from the blood pool and most organs, except the pancreas. Conclusion (18)F FSPG is a PET radiopharmaceutical characterized by rapid clearance from most healthy tissues, except the pancreas and kidneys. A consistent biodistribution pattern was observed with low background uptake. The physiologic uptake of this new radiotracer throughout the body is described in more detail, which is important for improved interpretative accuracy and understanding potential clinical applications.

        "Purpose To develop a deep learning (DL) algorithm to assess mammographic breast density. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, a deep convolutional neural network was trained to assess Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) breast density based on the original interpretation by an experienced radiologist of 41 479 digital screening mammograms obtained in 27 684 women from January 2009 to May 2011. The resulting algorithm was tested on a held-out test set of 8677 mammograms in 5741 women. In addition, five radiologists performed a reader study on 500 mammograms randomly selected from the test set. Finally, the algorithm was implemented in routine clinical practice, where eight radiologists reviewed 10 763 consecutive mammograms assessed with the model. Agreement on BI-RADS category for the DL model and for three sets of readings-(a) radiologists in the test set, (b) radiologists working in consensus in the reader study set, and (c) radiologists in the clinical implementation set-were estimated with linear-weighted \u03ba statistics and were compared across 5000 bootstrap samples to assess significance. Results The DL model showed good agreement with radiologists in the test set (\u03ba = 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.66, 0.68) and with radiologists in consensus in the reader study set (\u03ba = 0.78; 95% CI: 0.73, 0.82). There was very good agreement (\u03ba = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.84, 0.86) with radiologists in the clinical implementation set; for binary categorization of dense or nondense breasts, 10 149 of 10 763 (94%; 95% CI: 94%, 95%) DL assessments were accepted by the interpreting radiologist. Conclusion This DL model can be used to assess mammographic breast density at the level of an experienced mammographer. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article .

        "Purpose To investigate the value of T2-weighted-based radiomics compared with qualitative assessment at T2-weighted imaging and diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging for diagnosis of clinical complete response in patients with rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy-radiation therapy (CRT). Materials and Methods This retrospective study included 114 patients with rectal cancer who underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging after CRT between March 2012 and February 2016. Median age among women (47 of 114, 41%) was 55.9 years (interquartile range, 45.4-66.7 years) and median age among men (67 of 114, 59%) was 55 years (interquartile range, 48-67 years). Surgical histopathologic analysis was the reference standard for pathologic complete response (pCR). For qualitative assessment, two radiologists reached a consensus. For radiomics, one radiologist segmented the volume of interest on high-spatial-resolution T2-weighted images. A random forest classifier was trained to separate the patients by their outcomes after balancing the number of patients in each response category by using the synthetic minority oversampling technique. Statistical analysis was performed by using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, McNemar test, and Benjamini-Hochberg method. Results Twenty-one of 114 patients (18%) achieved pCR. The radiomic classifier demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.93 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.87, 0.96), sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 0.84, 1), specificity of 91% (95% CI: 0.84, 0.96), positive predictive value of 72% (95% CI: 0.53, 0.87), and negative predictive value of 100% (95% CI: 0.96, 1). The diagnostic performance of radiomics was significantly higher than was qualitative assessment at T2-weighted imaging or DW imaging alone (P < .02). The specificity and positive predictive values were significantly higher in radiomics than were at combined T2-weighted and DW imaging (P < .0001). Conclusion T2-weighted-based radiomics showed better classification performance compared with qualitative assessment at T2-weighted and DW imaging for diagnosing pCR in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer after CRT. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To compare image quality obtained in phantoms with virtual monochromatic spectral (VMS) imaging with that obtained with conventional 120-kVp computed tomography (CT) for a given radiation dose.Three syringes were filled with a diluted contrast medium (each syringe contained a contrast medium with a different iodine concentration [5, 10, or 15 mg of iodine per milliliter]), and a fourth syringe was filled with water. These syringes were placed in a torso phantom meant to simulate the standard human physique. The phantom was examined with a CT system and use of the fast kilovoltage switching (80 and 140 kVp) and conventional (120 kVp) modes. Image noise and contrast-to-noise (CNR) ratio were analyzed on VMS images and 120-kVp CT images.Image noise on VMS images in the range of 67-72 keV was significantly lower than that on the 120-kVp CT images (P < .014). Image noise was lowest at 69 keV and was 12% lower when compared with that on 120-kVp CT images. CNR on the VMS images was highest at 68 keV. CNR on the VMS images obtained at 68 keV in the syringes filled with diluted contrast material (5, 10, and 15 mg of iodine per milliliter) was 28%, 31%, and 30% higher, respectively, compared with that on the 120-kVp CT images (P < .001).VMS imaging at approximately 70 keV yielded lower image noise and higher CNR than did 120-kVp CT for a given radiation dose. VMS imaging has the potential to replace 120-kVp CT as the standard CT imaging modality, since optimal VMS imaging may be expected to yield improved image quality in a patient with standard body habitus.",
        "Purpose To develop a method to assess volumetric cortical bone porosity in clinically practical acquisition times by measuring the signal decay at only two echo times (TEs) as part of a single three-dimensional ultrashort TE (UTE) magnetic resonance (MR) examination. Materials and Methods The study was approved by the institutional review board and complied with HIPAA guidelines. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. A marker of cortical bone porosity called porosity index was defined as the ratio of UTE image intensities at a long and short TE, and the results were compared with biexponential analysis. Porosity index of midtibia cortical bone samples obtained from 16 donors was compared with ground-truth porosity by using micro\u2013computed tomographic (CT) imaging and bone mineral density by peripheral quantitative CT scanner. Reproducibility of porosity index were tested in volunteers, and clinical feasibility was evaluated in postmenopausal women. Interparameter associations were assessed by using Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficient. Results Bone specimen porosity index was correlated with micro-CT imaging porosity (R2 = 0.79) and pore size (R2 = 0.81); age (R2 = 0.64); peripheral quantitative CT scanner density (R2 = 0.49, negatively); and pore water fraction (R2 = 0.62) and T2* (R2 = 0.64) by biexponential analysis. The reproducibility study yielded a coefficient of variation of 2.2% and intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.97. The study that involved postmenopausal women showed a wide range of porosity index (15%\u201338%). Conclusion A two-point MR imaging method to assess cortical bone porosity in humans was conceived and validated. This approach has the potential for clinical use to assess changes in cortical bone porosity that result from disease or in response to therapy. \u00a9 RSNA, 2015 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To evaluate whether contrast material\u2013enhanced (CE) fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition (FIESTA) can depict the anterior optic pathways in patients with large suprasellar tumors. Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval was obtained. Twenty-eight patients with large suprasellar tumors undergoing surgical treatment (19 pituitary adenomas, six meningiomas, and three additional miscellaneous tumors) underwent preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, including CE FIESTA, at 3.0 T. Two radiologists assessed the visibility of five segments of the optic pathways (bilateral optic nerves and optic tracts, optic chiasm) with CE FIESTA and conventional MR imaging, including thin-section coronal T2-weighted imaging and CE T1-weighted imaging, by using a three-point scale. Moreover, the preoperative signal intensity of the optic pathways was correlated with pre- and postoperative visual impairment to determine whether high signal intensity at CE FIESTA is predictive of persistence of visual impairment after surgery. The \u03c72 test was used to compare scores assigned to CE FIESTA and conventional MR images. Results The percentage of anterior optic pathways rated as visible was significantly higher with CE FIESTA than with conventional MR imaging (100% [140 of 140 segments] vs 78% [109 of 140 segments], P < .05). Thirty-one of the 140 segments (22%) were not depicted with conventional MR imaging; all of these 31 segments were visualized with CE FIESTA. For 12 patients who underwent transcranial surgery, the anatomic locations of the optic pathways at CE FIESTA were compatible with the surgical findings. CE FIESTA helped predict persistent visual impairment after surgical treatment with a sensitivity of 75% (three of four patients) and a specificity of 96% (23 of 24 patients). The accuracy of CT FIESTA in the prediction of visual loss was significantly higher than that of T2-weighted imaging (93% [26 of 28 patients] vs 50% [14 of 28 patients], P < .05). Conclusion CE FIESTA is useful for the preoperative localization of the anterior optic pathways in patients with large suprasellar tumors and offers the potential to predict persistent visual impairment after decompression. \u00a9 RSNA, 2012 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.12111363/-/DC1",
        "Background: Neurologic complications in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been described, but the understanding of their pathophysiologic causes and neuroanatomical correlates remains limited  Purpose: To report on the frequency and type of neuroradiological findings in COVID-19  Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, all consecutive adult hospitalized patients with polymerase chain reaction positivity for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and who underwent neuroimaging at Karolinska University Hospital between March 2 and May 24, 2020, were included  All examinations were systematically re-evaluated by 12 readers  Summary descriptive statistics were calculated",
        "Purpose To develop diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) and achievable doses (ADs) for the 10 most common adult computed tomographic (CT) examinations in the United States as a function of patient size by using the CT Dose Index Registry. Materials and Methods Data from the 10 most commonly performed adult CT head, neck, and body examinations from 583 facilities were analyzed. For head examinations, the lateral thickness was used as an indicator of patient size; for neck and body examinations, water-equivalent diameter was used. Data from 1 310 727 examinations (analyzed by using SAS 9.3) provided median values, as well as means and 25th and 75th (DRL) percentiles for volume CT dose index (CTDIvol), dose-length product (DLP), and size-specific dose estimate (SSDE). Applicable results were compared with DRLs from eight countries. Results More than 46% of the facilities were community hospitals; 13% were academic facilities. More than 48% were in metropolitan areas, 39% were suburban, and 13% were rural. More than 50% of the facilities performed fewer than 500 examinations per month. The abdomen and pelvis was the most frequently performed examination in the study (45%). For body examinations, DRLs (75th percentile) and ADs (median) for CTDIvol, SSDE, and DLP increased consistently with the patient's size (water-equivalent diameter). The relationships between patient size and DRLs and ADs were not as strong for head and neck examinations. These results agree well with the data from other countries. Conclusion DRLs and ADs as a function of patient size were developed for the 10 most common adult CT examinations performed in the United States. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017.",
        "A 14-year-old boy presented with asthenia, low back pain, and abdominal distention. The onset of symptoms was slow and progressive over a few months. The patient had no contributing past medical history. At physical examination, all vital signs were normal. Only pallor and positive fluid wave test results were noted; there was no lower limb edema, mucocutaneous lesions, or palpable lymph node enlargement. Laboratory work-up revealed a decreased hemoglobin concentration of 9.3 g/dL (normal range, 12-16 g/dL) and a decreased hematocrit level of 29.8% (normal range, 37%-45%), but all other laboratory values were normal.

        "Some patients with positive chest CT findings may present with negative results of real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this study, the authors present chest CT findings from five patients with COVID-19 infection who had initial negative RT-PCR results. All five patients had typical imaging findings, including ground-glass opacity (five patients) and/or mixed ground-glass opacity and mixed consolidation (two patients). After isolation for presumed COVID-19 pneumonia, all patients were eventually confirmed to have COVID-19 infection by means of repeated swab tests. A combination of repeated swab tests and CT scanning may be helpful for individuals with a high clinical suspicion of COVID-19 infection but negative findings at RT-PCR screening.",
        "To characterize the position, shape, and orientation of the long biceps tendon (LBT) on transverse magnetic resonance (MR) images acquired in neutral position and in maximal external and internal rotation of the shoulder in asymptomatic volunteers.Informed consent was obtained from all volunteers for this institutional review board-approved study. Fifty-three asymptomatic volunteers (mean age, 33 years; age range, 21-58 years) were included. The position of the LBT with respect to the bicipital groove was measured by two musculoskeletal radiologists on three levels along the bicipital groove on axial MR images in neutral position and in external and internal rotation of the shoulder. The shape of the LBT was classified as round, oval, flat, or comma shaped, and the orientation of the LBT was measured.The position of the LBT changed significantly at the entrance into the bicipital groove in the mediolateral and anteroposterior directions (P < .01). The changes of LBT position in external rotation and internal rotation compared with the neutral position were markedly small (< 1.5 mm). Medial eccentricity of the LBT was greatest in the neutral shoulder position at all measurement levels. Differences in LBT shape and orientation were found between the neutral position and external or internal rotation and between the three measurement levels.The position of the LBT is only slightly dependent on shoulder rotation. LBT eccentricity is maximal in the neutral position. Rotational misplacement during image acquisition does not increase LBT eccentricity.",
        "To determine the effect of evidence-based clinical decision support (CDS) on the use and yield of computed tomographic (CT) pulmonary angiography for acute pulmonary embolism (PE) in the emergency department (ED).Institutional review board approval was obtained for this HIPAA-compliant study, which was performed between October 1, 2003, and September 30, 2009, at a 793-bed quaternary care institution with 60,000 annual ED visits. Use (number of examinations per 1000 ED visits) and yield (percentage of examinations positive for acute PE) of CT pulmonary angiography were compared before and after CDS implementation in August 2007. The authors included all adult patients presenting to the ED and developed and validated a natural language processing tool to identify acute PE diagnoses. Linear trend analysis was used to assess for variation in CT pulmonary angiography use. Logistic regression was used to determine variation in yield after controlling for patient demographic and clinical characteristics.Of 338,230 patients presenting to the ED, 6838 (2.0%) underwent CT pulmonary angiography. Quarterly CT pulmonary angiography use increased 82.1% before CDS implementation, from 14.5 to 26.4 examinations per 1000 patients (P<.0001) between October 10, 2003, and July 31, 2007. After CDS implementation, quarterly use decreased 20.1%, from 26.4 to 21.1 examinations per 1000 patients between August 1, 2007, and September 30, 2009 (P=.0379). Overall, 686 (10.0%) of the CT pulmonary angiographic examinations performed during the 6-year period were positive for PE; subsequent to CDS implementation, yield by quarter increased 69.0%, from 5.8% to 9.8% (P=.0323).Implementation of evidence-based CDS in the ED was associated with a significant decrease in use, and increase in yield, of CT pulmonary angiography for the evaluation of acute PE.",
        "Purpose To predict survival in patients with metastatic melanoma by evaluating a combination of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level and initial computed tomographic (CT) findings of tumor devascularization after antiangiogenic therapy. Materials and Methods Consent was waived for this institutional review board\u2013approved, retrospective, secondary analysis. Forty-four patients with metastatic melanoma received bevacizumab therapy in a randomized prospective phase II trial. Target lesions on the initial posttherapy CT images were evaluated by using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, the Choi criteria, and Morphology, Attenuation, Size, and Structure (MASS) criteria. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association of baseline clinical variables including serum LDH and imaging findings with progression-free and overall survival. The receiver operating characteristic curve with area under the curve (AUC) was used to evaluate accuracy. Results In multivariate analysis, a high baseline serum LDH level was associated with decreased progression-free survival (hazard ratio = 1.29 for each increase of 100 IU/L; P = .002) and overall survival (hazard ratio = 1.44 for each increase of 100 IU/L; P = .001). Evaluation with MASS criteria of the first CT examination after therapy strongly predicted progression-free (P < .001) and overall (P < .001) survival. Baseline serum LDH level was moderately accurate for predicting progression-free survival at 9 months (AUC = 0.793) and overall survival at 18 months (AUC = 0.689). The combination of baseline serum LDH levels and evaluation with MASS criteria at the first CT examination after therapy had significantly higher accuracy for predicting progression-free survival at 9 months (AUC = 0.969) and overall survival at 18 months (AUC = 0.813) than did baseline serum LDH levels alone for prediction of progression-free survival (P = .020). Conclusion A combination of baseline serum LDH levels and evaluation with MASS criteria at the first CT examination after bevacizumab therapy had the highest accuracy for predicting survival in patients with metastatic melanoma. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To test the feasibility of noninvasive global assessment of cerebral hemodynamic impairment with use of resting-state blood oxygenation level\u2013dependent functional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Materials and Methods In this institutional review board\u2013approved study, five patients with chronic hypoperfusion without neurologic impairment and six patients with acute stroke underwent 10-minute resting-state functional MR imaging and dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced perfusion MR imaging, which was considered the standard of reference. All patients gave informed consent. The temporal shift of low-frequency signal fluctuations in each voxel compared with the averaged whole brain or global mean signal at resting-state functional MR imaging and the delay in time to peak at dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced perfusion imaging were computed with voxel-wise analysis. The similarity of the temporal delay maps obtained with resting-state functional MR imaging and perfusion data, as well as the stability of the resting-state functional MR imaging measurement, were evaluated with the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and the two-tailed t test (random-effect analysis). Results The brain tissue with normal perfusion at dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced imaging showed no delay to global mean signal at resting-state functional MR imaging, whereas areas of abnormal perfusion with delayed time to peak (3.4 seconds \u00b1 2.1) showed a delay at resting-state functional MR imaging that was similar to the time to peak at dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced perfusion imaging, both in spatial coverage (mean DSC, 0.57 \u00b1 0.16) and tendency (t = 5.1, P < .001). Resting-state functional MR imaging measurements were highly stable (mean DSC, 0.83 \u00b1 0.12). Conclusion Resting-state functional MR imaging temporal-shift analysis can noninvasively demonstrate the extent and degree of perfusion delay in patients with hypoperfusion both with and without neurologic deficit. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",

        "Background Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) are heterogeneous neoplasms, and the prognosis varies based on the subtype. Two broad molecular classes of HCC have been proposed: a proliferative and a nonproliferative class. Purpose To evaluate the gadoxetate-enhanced MRI findings of the proliferative class HCC and its prognostic significance after surgery. Materials and Methods This retrospective cohort study evaluated patients with surgically resected treatment-naive single HCC (\u22645 cm) who underwent hepatic resection from January 2010 through February 2013 and preoperative gadoxetate-enhanced MRI. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine the predictive factors for overall survival (OS), intrahepatic distant recurrence, and extrahepatic metastasis (EM). The mean follow-up period was 75.5 months \u00b1 30.2 (standard deviation). Multivariable logistic regression was performed to determine factors associated with proliferative class HCC. Results A total of 158 patients (mean age, 57 years \u00b1 11; 128 men and 30 women) were evaluated. Forty-two of the 158 HCCs (26.6%) were proliferative class HCCs (17 macrotrabecular-massive HCCs, 14 keratin 19\u2013positive HCCs, 10 scirrhous HCCs, and one sarcomatoid HCC). The proliferative class was associated with worse OS (hazard ratio [HR], 3.1; 95% CI: 1.5, 6.0; P = .01) and higher rates of intrahepatic distant recurrence (HR, 1.83; 95% CI: 1.1, 2.9; P = .01) and EM (HR, 9.97; 95% CI: 3.2, 31.4; P < .001). Rim arterial phase hyperenhancement (APHE) at gadoxetate-enhanced MRI (odds ratio [OR], 6.35; 95% CI: 1.9, 21.7; P = .01) and high serum \u03b1-fetoprotein (>100 ng/mL) (OR, 4.18; 95% CI: 1.64, 10.7; P = .01) were independent predictors for proliferative HCC. The presence of rim APHE was associated with poor OS (HR, 2.4; 95% CI: 1.2, 4.9; P = .02) and higher rates of EM (HR, 7.4; 95% CI: 2.5, 21.7; P < .01). Conclusion The proliferative class of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an independent factor for poor overall survival with increased rates of intrahepatic and extrahepatic metastasis. Rim arterial phase hyperenhancement at gadoxetate-enhanced MRI may help to identify proliferative class HCC and predict poor overall survival and an increased incidence of extrahepatic metastasis. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "History A 29-year-old woman presented with a 6-month history of progressive general fatigue, fluctuating limb weakness, and difficulty climbing stairs. She initially experienced occasional episodes of transient diplopia that developed while reading in the evening. She subsequently started to experience dry eyes and mouth, difficulty chewing, and mild dysphagia that worsened throughout the day. Her medical history included hypothyroidism from Hashimoto thyroiditis and pneumonia with left pleural effusion. She had no smoking history, and her body mass index was normal (23.8 kg/m2). No medication use was reported at admission. Physical examination revealed mild bilateral ptosis, reduced muscle tone and strength that worsened in proximal leg muscles, and decreased deep tendon reflexes. An edrophonium test revealed improvement in muscle strength and eyelid ptosis. Repetitive nerve stimulation revealed low amplitude of compound muscle action potential at rest (0.21 mV), with a marked increase (700%; normal increase, <60%) at high-rate stimulation (50 Hz). Laboratory work-up was unremarkable except for detection of acetylcholine receptor antibodies in the serum (21.30 nmol/L) and P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel antibodies (220 pmol/L). Recent MRI of the brain and spine at an outside hospital showed no abnormal findings. At admission, the patient underwent CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis ( Fig 1 ) followed by thoracic MRI ( Figs 2 , 3 ) to further evaluate CT findings.

        "To evaluate the role of core-needle biopsy (CNB) in thyroid nodules with nondiagnostic results at previous fine-needle aspiration (FNA).From October 2008 to July 2011, 155 nodules from 155 patients (37 men, 118 women) with a mean age of 51.8 years (age range, 22-76 years) with nondiagnostic results at previous FNA were reviewed retrospectively. The Bethesda system for reporting thyroid cytopathologic results was used to assign FNA and CNB findings. Malignant nodules (n = 37) were diagnosed after surgery. Benign nodules (n = 79) were diagnosed either after surgery, with benign findings after FNA and/or CNB that had been repeated at least twice, or after benign cytology findings at FNA or CNB with a stable size at follow-up. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of ultrasonographically guided CNB were evaluated.At CNB, two nodules (1.3%) showed nondiagnostic results, and 135 nodules (87.1%) had conclusive diagnoses. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of core biopsies for the detection of malignancy were 94.6% (35 of 37), 100% (79 of 79), 100% (35 of 35), 97.5% (79 of 81), and 98.3% (114 of 116), respectively. For 28 nodules, nondiagnostic results were found after two or more FNA procedures; however, diagnostic surgery was performed in only one patient.CNB of the thyroid nodule demonstrates high rates of conclusive and accurate diagnoses in patients for whom previous FNA results were nondiagnostic, thereby reducing the need for unnecessary diagnostic surgery.",
        "To compare the diagnostic accuracy of two-dimensional (2D) full-field digital mammography with that of two-view (mediolateral and craniocaudal) and single-view (mediolateral oblique) tomosynthesis in an observer study involving two institutions.Ethical committee approval was obtained. All participating women gave informed consent. Two hundred twenty women (mean age, 56.3; range, 40-80 years) with breast density of 2-4 according to American College of Radiology criteria were recruited between November 2008 and September 2009 and underwent standard treatment plus tomosynthesis with a prototype photon-counting machine. After exclusion criteria were met, this resulted in a final test set of 130 women. Ten accredited readers classified the 130 cases (40 cancers, 24 benign lesions, and 66 normal images) using 2D mammography and two-view tomosynthesis. Another 10 readers reviewed the same cases using 2D mammography but single-view tomosynthesis. The multireader, multicase receiver operating characteristic (ROC) method was applied. The significance of the observed difference in accuracy between 2D mammography and tomosynthesis was calculated.For diagnostic accuracy, 2D mammography performed significantly worse than two-view tomosynthesis (average area under ROC curve [AUC] = 0.772 for 2D, AUC = 0.851 for tomosynthesis, P = .021). Significant differences were found for both masses and microcalcification (P = .037 and .049). The difference in AUC between the two modalities of -0.110 was significant (P = .03) only for the five readers with the least experience (<10 years of reading); with AUC of -0.047 for the five readers with 10 years or more experience (P = .25). No significant difference (P = .79) in reader performance was seen when 2D mammography (average AUC = 0.774) was compared with single-view tomosynthesis (average AUC = 0.775).Two-view tomosynthesis outperforms 2D mammography but only for readers with the least experience. The benefits were seen for both masses and microcalcification. No differences in classification accuracy was seen between and 2D mammography and single-view tomosynthesis.",
        "Purpose To compare gadolinium tissue concentrations of multiple linear and macrocyclic chelates in a rat model to better understand the scope and extent of tissue deposition following multiple intravenous doses of gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA). Materials and Methods In this Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved study, healthy rats received 20 intravenous injections of 2.5 mmol gadolinium per kilogram (gadolinium-exposed group) or saline (control group) over a 26-day period. Unenhanced T1 signal intensities of the dentate nucleus were measured from magnetic resonance (MR) images obtained prior to GBCA injection and 3 days after final injection. Rat brain and renal, hepatic, and splenic tissues were harvested 7 days after final injection and subjected to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and transmission electron microscopy for quantification and characterization of gadolinium deposits. Results Gadolinium deposition in brain tissue significantly varied with GBCA type (F = 31.2; P < .0001), with median concentrations of 0 \u03bcg gadolinium per gram of tissue (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0, 0.2) in gadoteridol-injected rats, 1.6 \u03bcg gadolinium per gram of tissue (95% CI: 0.9, 4.7) in gadobutrol-injected rats, 4.7 \u03bcg gadolinium per gram of tissue (95% CI: 3.5, 6.1) in gadobenate dimeglumine-injected rats, and 6.9 \u03bcg gadolinium per gram of tissue (95% CI: 6.2, 7.0) in gadodiamide-injected rats; a significant positive dose-signal intensity correlation was identified (\u03c1 = 0.93; P < .0001). No detectable neural tissue deposition or MR imaging signal was observed in control rats (n = 6). Similar relative differences in gadolinium deposition were observed in renal, hepatic, and splenic tissues at much higher tissue concentrations (P < .0001). Gadolinium deposits were visualized directly in the endothelial capillary walls and neural interstitium in GBCA-injected rats, but not in control rats. Conclusion Tissue deposition of gadolinium was two- to fourfold higher following administration of the linear agents gadodiamide and gadobenate dimeglumine compared with the macrocyclic agents gadobutrol and gadoteridol. These findings suggest that organ tissue deposition is reduced but not eliminated following administration of macrocyclic GBCA chelates in lieu of linear chelates. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To investigate the utility and accuracy of breast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging as a supplemental screening tool in women at average risk for breast cancer and to investigate the types of cancer detected with MR imaging screening. Materials and Methods This prospective observational study was conducted at two academic breast centers in women aged 40-70 years without breast cancer-associated risk factors (lifetime risk <15%). Between January 2005 and December 2013, women with at least minimal residual breast tissue (American College of Radiology categories A-D) and normal conventional imaging findings (screening mammography with or without screening ultrasonography [US]) were invited to undergo supplemental MR imaging screening. Outcome measures were supplemental cancer detection rates, interval cancer rates, and biologic profiles of MR imaging-detected additional cancers, as well as specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) of MR imaging screening. Tissue diagnoses or 2 years of follow-up were used to establish the reference standard. Results A total of 2120 women were recruited and underwent 3861 screening MR imaging studies, covering an observation period of 7007 women-years. Breast MR imaging depicted 60 additional breast cancers (ductal carcinoma in situ, n = 20; invasive carcinoma, n = 40) for an overall supplemental cancer detection rate of 15.5 per 1000 cases (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.9, 20.0). Forty-eight additional cancers were detected with MR imaging at initial screening (supplemental cancer detection rate, 22.6 per 1000 cases). During the 1741 subsequent screening rounds, 12 of 13 incident cancers were found with MR imaging alone (supplemental cancer detection rate, 6.9 per 1000 cases). One cancer was diagnosed with all three methods (mammography, US, and MR imaging), and none were diagnosed with mammography only or US only. Cancers diagnosed with MR imaging were small (median, 8 mm), node negative in 93.4% of cases, and dedifferentiated (high-grade cancer) in 41.7% of cases at prevalence screening and 46.0% of cases at incidence screening. No interval cancers were observed. MR imaging screening offered high specificity (97.1%; 95% CI: 96.5, 97.6) and high PPV (35.7%; 95% CI: 28.9, 43.1). Conclusion In women at average risk for breast cancer, MR imaging screening improves early diagnosis of prognostically relevant breast cancer. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",

Materials and Methods The authors prospectively enrolled participants with HCM who underwent 3.0-T cardiovascular MRI from August 2011 to October 2017. The authors also enrolled 100 age- and sex-matched healthy participants to form a comparison group. Trabeculae were quantified with fractal analysis of cine slices to estimate the fractal dimension (FD). Participants with HCM were divided into normal and high FD groups according to the upper limit of normal reference value from the healthy group. The primary end point was defined as all-cause mortality and aborted sudden cardiac death. The secondary end point was the composite of the primary end point and readmission to the hospital owing to heart failure. Internal validation was performed using the bootstrapping method. Results A total of 378 participants with HCM (median age, 50 years; age range, 40-61 years; 207 men) and 100 healthy participants (median age, 46 years; age range, 36-59 years; 55 women) were included in this study. During the median follow-up of 33 months \u00b1 18 (standard deviation), the increased maximal apical FD (\u22651.325) had a higher risk of the primary and secondary end points than those with a normal FD (<1.325) (P = .01 and P = .04, respectively). Furthermore, Cox analysis revealed that left ventricular maximal apical FD (hazard ratio range, 1.001-1.008; all P < .05) provided significant prognostic value to predict the primary and secondary end points after adjustment for the European Society of Cardiology predictors and late gadolinium enhancement. Internal validation showed that left ventricular maximal apical FD retained a good performance in predicting the primary end points with an area under the curve of 0.70 \u00b1 0.03. Conclusion Left ventricular apical fractal dimension, which reflects myocardial trabecular complexity, was an independent predictor of the primary and secondary end points in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Purpose To evaluate the effectiveness of small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) in suppressing granulation tissue formation caused by bare metallic stent placement in a rat urethral model. Materials and Methods All experiments were approved by the committee of animal research. In 20 Sprague-Dawley male rats (weight range, 300\u2013350 g), a self-expanding metallic bare stent was inserted in the urethra with fluoroscopic guidance. One group of 10 rats (group A) was treated with MMP-9 siRNA/bioreducible branched polyethylenimine\u2013disulfide cross-linked\u2013indocyanine green (bioreducible BPEI\u2013SS-ICG), while the other group of 10 rats (group B) received control siRNA/bioreducible BPEI\u2013SS-ICG treatment. All rats were sacrificed at 4 weeks. The therapeutic effectiveness of the MMP-9 siRNA/bioreducible BPEI\u2013SS-ICG complex was assessed by comparing the two results of retrograde urethrography, histologic examination, and quantification of MMP-9 by using zymography and Western blot analysis between the two groups. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to evaluate differences. Results Stent placement was successful in all rats without a single case of migration at follow-up. Retrograde urethrography performed 4 weeks after stent placement demonstrated significantly larger luminal diameters of the urethra within the stents in group A compared with those in group B (P = .011). Histologic analysis revealed that the mean percentage of granulation tissue area (P < .001), mean number of epithelial layers (P < .001), and mean thickness of submucosal fibrosis (P < .001) were significantly decreased in group A compared with group B. Meanwhile, the mean density of inflammatory cell infiltration did not significantly differ between the two groups (P = .184). Quantitative analysis disclosed MMP-9 levels to be lower in group A relative to group B, indicating positive inhibition of MMP-9 by MMP-9 siRNA/bioreducible BPEI\u2013SS-ICG. Conclusion MMP-9 siRNA/bioreducible BPEI\u2013SS-ICG is effective for inhibiting granulation tissue formation after bare metallic stent placement in a rat urethral model. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "Purpose To document the imaging findings associated with congenital Zika virus infection as found in the Instituto de Pesquisa in Campina Grande State Paraiba (IPESQ) in northeastern Brazil, where the congenital infection has been particularly severe. Materials and Methods From June 2015 to May 2016, 438 patients were referred to the IPESQ for rash occurring during pregnancy or for suspected fetal central nervous system abnormality. Patients who underwent imaging at IPESQ were included, as well as those with documented Zika virus infection in fluid or tissue (n = 17, confirmed infection cohort) or those with brain findings suspicious for Zika virus infection, with intracranial calcifications (n = 28, presumed infection cohort). Imaging examinations included 12 fetal magnetic resonance (MR) examinations, 42 postnatal brain computed tomographic examinations, and 11 postnatal brain MR examinations. Images were reviewed by four radiologists, with final opinion achieved by means of consensus. Results Brain abnormalities seen in confirmed (n = 17) and presumed (n = 28) congenital Zika virus infections were similar, with ventriculomegaly in 16 of 17 (94%) and 27 of 28 (96%) infections, respectively; abnormalities of the corpus callosum in 16 of 17 (94%) and 22 of 28 (78%) infections, respectively; and cortical migrational abnormalities in 16 of 17 (94%) and 28 of 28 (100%) infections, respectively. Although most fetuses underwent at least one examination that showed head circumference below the 5th percentile, head circumference could be normal in the presence of severe ventriculomegaly (seen in three fetuses). Intracranial calcifications were most commonly seen at the gray matter\u2013white matter junction, in 15 of 17 (88%) and 28 of 28 (100%) confirmed and presumed infections, respectively. The basal ganglia and/or thalamus were also commonly involved with calcifications in 11 of 17 (65%) and 18 of 28 (64%) infections, respectively. The skull frequently had a collapsed appearance with overlapping sutures and redundant skin folds and, occasionally, intracranial herniation of orbital fat and clot in the confluence of sinuses. Conclusion The spectrum of findings associated with congenital Zika virus infection in the IPESQ in northeastern Brazil is illustrated to aid the radiologist in identifying Zika virus infection at imaging. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "In an effort to improve the technical success rates and clinical outcomes of radiofrequency (RF) ablation, Yan et al validated the use of a tumor-penetrating peptide and thermosensitive doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded nanoparticles in combination with RF ablation in a hepatocellular carcinoma mouse model. By achieving higher chemotherapeutic drug concentrations in target lesions, fewer toxic effects, and improved survival end points in an animal tumor model, the authors conclude that superior tumor treatment with RF ablation is possible when combined with molecular-targeted drug delivery systems.",
        "Purpose To investigate the impact of radiation dose on breast density estimation in digital mammography. Materials and Methods With institutional review board approval and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliance under waiver of consent, a cohort of women from the American College of Radiology Imaging Network Pennsylvania 4006 trial was retrospectively analyzed. All patients underwent breast screening with a combination of dose protocols, including standard full-field digital mammography, low-dose digital mammography, and digital breast tomosynthesis. A total of 5832 images from 486 women were analyzed with previously validated, fully automated software for quantitative estimation of density. Clinical Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) density assessment results were also available from the trial reports. The influence of image acquisition radiation dose on quantitative breast density estimation was investigated with analysis of variance and linear regression. Pairwise comparisons of density estimations at different dose levels were performed with Student t test. Agreement of estimation was evaluated with quartile-weighted Cohen kappa values and Bland-Altman limits of agreement. Results Radiation dose of image acquisition did not significantly affect quantitative density measurements (analysis of variance, P = .37 to P = .75), with percent density demonstrating a high overall correlation between protocols (r = 0.88-0.95; weighted \u03ba = 0.83-0.90). However, differences in breast percent density (1.04% and 3.84%, P < .05) were observed within high BI-RADS density categories, although they were significantly correlated across the different acquisition dose levels (r = 0.76-0.92, P < .05). Conclusion Precision and reproducibility of automated breast density measurements with digital mammography are not substantially affected by variations in radiation dose; thus, the use of low-dose techniques for the purpose of density estimation may be feasible.

        "Purpose To determine the interobserver reproducibility of the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 2 lexicon. Materials and Methods This retrospective HIPAA-compliant study was institutional review board\u2013approved. Six radiologists from six separate institutions, all experienced in prostate magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, assessed prostate MR imaging examinations performed at a single center by using the PI-RADS lexicon. Readers were provided screen captures that denoted the location of one specific lesion per case. Analysis entailed two sessions (40 and 80 examinations per session) and an intersession training period for individualized feedback and group discussion. Percent agreement (fraction of pairwise reader combinations with concordant readings) was compared between sessions. \u03ba coefficients were computed. Results No substantial difference in interobserver agreement was observed between sessions, and the sessions were subsequently pooled. Agreement for PI-RADS score of 4 or greater was 0.593 in peripheral zone (PZ) and 0.509 in transition zone (TZ). In PZ, reproducibility was moderate to substantial for features related to diffusion-weighted imaging (\u03ba = 0.535\u20130.619); fair to moderate for features related to dynamic contrast material\u2013enhanced (DCE) imaging (\u03ba = 0.266\u20130.439); and fair for definite extraprostatic extension on T2-weighted images (\u03ba = 0.289). In TZ, reproducibility for features related to lesion texture and margins on T2-weighted images ranged from 0.136 (moderately hypointense) to 0.529 (encapsulation). Among 63 lesions that underwent targeted biopsy, classification as PI-RADS score of 4 or greater by a majority of readers yielded tumor with a Gleason score of 3+4 or greater in 45.9% (17 of 37), without missing any tumor with a Gleason score of 3+4 or greater. Conclusion Experienced radiologists achieved moderate reproducibility for PI-RADS version 2, and neither required nor benefitted from a training session. Agreement tended to be better in PZ than TZ, although was weak for DCE in PZ. The findings may help guide future PI-RADS lexicon updates. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To outline the conceptual development of dual-energy absorptiometric (DXA) region-free analysis, quantify its precision, and evaluate its application to quantify the change in longitudinal femoral periprosthetic bone mineral density (BMD) in patients during the 12 months after total hip arthroplasty.All subjects had undergone total hip arthroplasty for idiopathic arthritis, and the scans were collected as part of previous ethically approved studies (1998-2005) for which informed consent was provided. Contemporary image processing approaches were used to develop a region of interest-free DXA analysis method with increased spatial resolution for assessment of proximal femoral BMD. The method was calibrated, and its accuracy relative to a proprietary algorithm was assessed by using a hip phantom. The precision of the method was examined by using repeat DXA acquisitions in 29 patients, and its ability to allow spatial resolution of localized periprosthetic BMD change at the hip was assessed in an independent group of 19 patients who were measured throughout a 12-month period. Differences were evaluated with t tests (P < .05).The method allowed spatial resolution of more than 10 000 individual BMD data points on a typical archived prosthetic hip scan. The median data point-level error of the method after calibration was -1.9% (interquartile range, -7.2% to 3.5%) relative to a proprietary algorithm. The median data point-level precision, expressed as a coefficient of variation, was 1.4% (interquartile range, 1.2%-1.6%). Evaluation of BMD change in a model of periprosthetic bone loss demonstrated large but highly focal changes in BMD that would not be resolved by using traditional region of interest-based analysis approaches.The proposed approach provides a quantitative, precise method for extracting high-spatial-resolution BMD data from existing DXA datasets without the limitations imposed by region of interest-based analysis.",
        "History A 21-year-old man presented with swelling of the medial aspect of the left thigh of 1-month duration. There was no history of fever or penetrating injury in the left thigh. The patient had undergone renal transplantation 7 years earlier and had been taking immunosuppressants since transplantation. He had undergone two surgeries at the same site in the medial aspect of the left thigh in the past 3 years for a similar problem. At physical examination, there was swelling in the medial aspect of the left thigh, with mild tenderness. A surgical scar was noted anterior to the swelling ( Fig 1 ). No redness or discharging sinus was present. Laboratory results were as follows: hemoglobin level, 11.3 g/dL (normal range, 13.8-17.2 g/dL); white blood cell count, 9.7 \u00d7 109/L (normal range, [4-11] \u00d7 109/L); neutrophil, 75% (normal range, 48%-77%); lymphocyte, 22% (normal range, 10%-24%); eosinophil, 1% (normal range, 0.3%- 7%); monocyte, 1% (normal range, 0.6%-10%); serum creatinine level, 1.3 mg/dL (114.9 \u03bcmol/L) (normal range, 0.5-1.6 mg/dL [44.2-141.4 \u03bcmol/L]); and serum glucose (random) level, 82 mg/dL (4.5 mmol/L) (normal range, 79-140 mg/dL [4.4-7.8 mmol/L]). Radiography of the left thigh showed soft-tissue swelling in the medial aspect of the left thigh, without underlying bone involvement (not shown). Ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the left thigh were performed. [Figure: see text].",
        "Purpose To compare the diagnostic yield and complication rates of electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopic (ENB)-guided and computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous tissue sampling of lung nodules. Materials and Methods Retrospectively identified were 149 patients sampled percutaneously with CT guidance and 146 patients who underwent ENB with transbronchial biopsy of a lung lesion between 2013 and 2015. Clinical data, incidence of complications, and nodule pathologic analyses were assessed through electronic medical record review. Lung nodule characteristics were reviewed through direct image analysis. Molecular marker studies and pathologic analyses from surgical excision were reviewed when available. Multiple-variable logistic regression models were built to compare the diagnostic yield and complication rates for each method and for different patient and disease characteristics. Results CT-guided sampling was more likely to be diagnostic than ENB-guided biopsy (86.0% [129 of 150] vs 66.0% [99 of 150], respectively), and this difference remained significant even after adjustments were made for patient and nodule characteristics (P < .001). Age, American Society of Anesthesiologists class, emphysema grade, nodule size, and distance from pleura were not significant predictors of increased diagnostic yield. Intraprocedural time for physicians was significantly lower with CT-guided sampling (P < .001). Similar yield for molecular analyses was noted with the two approaches (ENB-guided sampling, 88.9% [32 of 36]; CT-guided sampling, 82.0% [41 of 50]). The two groups had similar rates of major complications (symptomatic hemorrhage, P > .999; pneumothorax requiring chest tube and/or admission, P = .417). Conclusion CT-guided transthoracic biopsy provided higher diagnostic yield in the assessment of peripheral pulmonary nodules than navigational bronchoscopy with a similar rate of clinically relevant complications. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",

She denied any associated fever, chills, redness, or pain. She had no relevant medical or surgical history; no evidence of recent pregnancy, abortion, or breastfeeding; and no family history of breast cancer. Clinical examination enabled confirmation of a firm mass occupying the retroareolar region and the outer quadrant of the left breast with no skin retraction, edema, or erythema. There was no evidence of enlarged axillary lymph nodes. US of the left breast (Fig 1), bilateral breast MRI (Fig 2), and fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT (Fig 3) were performed.",
        "Purpose To evaluate the association of multiparametric and multiregional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging features with key molecular characteristics in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Materials and Methods Retrospective data evaluation was approved by the local ethics committee, and the requirement to obtain informed consent was waived. Preoperative MR imaging features were correlated with key molecular characteristics within a single-institution cohort of 152 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Preoperative MR imaging features (n = 31) included multiparametric (anatomic and diffusion-, perfusion-, and susceptibility-weighted images) and multiregional (contrast-enhancing regions and hyperintense regions at nonenhanced fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging) information with histogram quantification of tumor volumes, volume ratios, apparent diffusion coefficients, cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume, and intratumoral susceptibility signals. Molecular characteristics determined included global DNA methylation subgroups (eg, mesenchymal, RTK I \"PGFRA,\" RTK II \"classic\"), MGMT promoter methylation status, and hallmark copy number variations (EGFR, PDGFRA, MDM4, and CDK4 amplification; PTEN, CDKN2A, NF1, and RB1 loss). Univariate analyses (voxel-lesion symptom mapping for tumor location, Wilcoxon test for all other MR imaging features) and machine learning models were applied to study the strength of association and discriminative value of MR imaging features for predicting underlying molecular characteristics. Results There was no tumor location predilection for any of the assessed molecular parameters (permutation-adjusted P > .05). Univariate imaging parameter associations were noted for EGFR amplification and CDKN2A loss, with both demonstrating increased Gaussian-normalized relative cerebral blood volume and Gaussian-normalized relative cerebral blood flow values (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve: 63%\u201369%, false discovery rate\u2013adjusted P < .05). Subjecting all MR imaging features to machine learning\u2013based classification enabled prediction of EGFR amplification status and the RTK II glioblastoma subgroup with a moderate, yet significantly greater, accuracy (63% for EGFR [P < .01], 61% for RTK II [P = .01]) than prediction by chance; prediction accuracy for all other molecular parameters was not significant. Conclusion The authors found associations between established MR imaging features and molecular characteristics, although not of sufficient strength to enable generation of machine learning classification models for reliable and clinically meaningful prediction of molecular characteristics in patients with glioblastoma. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To evaluate coronary arterial lesions and to assess their correlation with clinical findings in patients with Takayasu arteritis (TA) by using coronary computed tomographic (CT) angiography. Materials and Methods This retrospective study was approved by the hospital internal review board, and informed consent was waived. A total of 111 consecutive patients with TA (97 female, 14 male; mean age, 44 years \u00b1 13.8 [standard deviation]; age range, 14\u201374 years) underwent CT angiography of the coronary arteries and aorta with 128-section dual-source CT. CT angiographic, clinical, and laboratory findings of each patient were retrospectively reviewed. Statistical differences between coronary CT angiographic findings and clinical parameters were examined with univariate analysis. Results Of 111 patients, 32 (28.8%) had cardiac symptoms and the remaining 79 (71.2%) had no cardiac symptoms. Fifty-nine patients (53.2%) had coronary arterial lesions at coronary CT angiography. Three main radiologic features were detected: coronary ostial stenosis (n = 31, 28.0%), nonostial coronary arterial stenosis (n = 41, 36.9%), and coronary aneurysm (n = 9, 8.1%). Coronary artery ostial or luminal stenosis of 50% or more or coronary aneurysms were observed in 26 (23.4%) patients with TA. Patients with coronary arterial abnormalities at coronary CT angiography had higher incidences of hypertension (P = .02), were older at the time of CT (P = .01), and had longer duration of TA (P = .02) than those without coronary artery abnormalities. The presence of cardiac symptoms, disease activity, and other comorbidities was not associated with differences in coronary artery involvement. Conclusion In patients with TA, there is a high prevalence of coronary arterial abnormalities at coronary CT angiography, regardless of disease activity or symptoms. Thus, coronary CT angiography may add information on coronary artery lesions in patients with TA. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "Purpose To compare a glycosaminoglycan chemical exchange saturation transfer (gagCEST) imaging method, which enables sampling of the water signal as a function of the presaturation offset (z-spectrum) at 13 points in clinically feasible imaging times, with sodium 23 (23Na) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in patients after cartilage repair surgery (matrix-associated autologous chondrocyte transplantation and microfracture therapy). Materials and Methods One female patient (67.3 years), and 11 male patients (median age, 28.8 years; interquartile range [IQR], 24.6\u201332.3 years) were examined with a 7-T whole-body system, with approval of the local ethics committee after written informed consent was obtained. A modified three-dimensional gradient-echo sequence and a 28-channel knee coil were used for gagCEST imaging. 23Na imaging was performed with a circularly polarized knee coil by using a modified gradient-echo sequence. Statistical analysis of differences and Spearman correlation were applied. Results The median of asymmetries in gagCEST z-spectra summed over all offsets from 0 to 1.3 ppm was 7.99% (IQR, 6.33%\u20138.79%) in native cartilage and 5.13% (IQR, 2.64%\u20136.34%) in repair tissue. A strong correlation (r = 0.701; 95% confidence interval: 0.21, 0.91) was found between ratios of signal intensity from native cartilage to signal intensity from repair tissue obtained with gagCEST or 23Na imaging. The median of dimensionless ratios between native cartilage and repair tissue was 1.28 (IQR, 1.20\u20131.58) for gagCEST and 1.26 (IQR, 1.21\u20131.48) for 23Na MR imaging. Conclusion The high correlation between the introduced gagCEST method and 23Na imaging implies that gagCEST is a potentially useful biomarker for glycosaminoglycans. \u00a9 RSNA, 2011 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.11101841/-/DC1",
        "History A 31-year-old woman with a history of bilateral orthotopic lung transplantation performed 10 months earlier for cystic fibrosis presented for a routine follow-up appointment, with her chief symptom being a cough. The cough started approximately 1 month prior to this appointment and was minimally productive of clear to yellow phlegm. In addition to her cough, she reported increased sinus congestion and a sensation of \u201csomething in her upper chest.\u201d She denied shortness of breath, wheezing, hemoptysis, or cigarette smoking. Review of systems was negative for fever, chills, or night sweats. At physical examination, the patient was afebrile, borderline tachycardic (heart rate, 99 beats per minute), and mildly hypertensive (blood pressure, 138/99 mm Hg). Oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. Laboratory evaluation revealed a white blood cell count of 3.5 \u00d7 109/L (normal range, [3.2\u20139.8] \u00d7 109/L). Pulmonary function testing was notable for a newly decreased ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) to forced vital capacity (FVC) of 64% (2.0 and 3.4 L, respectively) (normal FEV1-to-FVC ratio, 80%), suggesting an obstructive lung process. One month prior to presentation, the patient\u2019s sputum cultures grew Pseudomonas and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The patient showed no evidence of active infection at the time of bronchoscopy. Thus, the bacteria were favored to reflect colonization, and antibiotic therapy was not administered at that time. The patient was taking an immunosuppression regimen of mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept; Genentech, San Francisco, Calif) (1 g twice daily), prednisone (10 mg daily), and tacrolimus (Prograf; Astellas Pharma US, Northbrook, Ill) (goal therapeutic range, 12\u201314 ng/mL).

        "To determine if ultrasonographic (US) renal shear-wave speed (SWS) measurements obtained either before or after intravenous diuretic administration can be used to discriminate obstructive hydronephrosis from unobstructive hydronephrosis in children, with diuretic renal scintigraphy as the reference standard.Institutional review board approval and parental informed consent were obtained for this HIPAA-compliant prospective cross-sectional blind comparison with a reference standard. Between November 2012 and September 2014, 37 children (mean age, 4.1 years; age range, 1 month to 17 years) underwent shear-wave elastography of the kidneys immediately before and immediately after diuretic renal scintigraphy (reference standard for presence of urinary tract obstruction). Median SWS measurements (in meters per second), as well as change in median SWS (median SWS after diuretic administration minus median SWS before diuretic administration) were correlated with the amount of time required for kidney radiotracer activity to fall by 50% after intravenous administration of the diuretic (T1/2). Median SWS measurements were compared with degree of obstruction and degree of hydronephrosis with analysis of variance. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were created.Radiotracer T1/2 values after diuretic administration did not correlate with median SWS measurements obtained before (r = -0.08, P = .53) or after (r = -0.0004, P >.99) diuretic administration, nor did they correlate with intraindividual change in median SWS (r = 0.07, P = .56). There was no significant difference in pre- or postdiuretic median SWS measurements between kidneys with scintigraphic evidence of no, equivocal, or definite urinary tract obstruction (P > .5) or for median SWS measurements between kidneys with increasing degree of hydronephrosis (P > .5). ROC curves showed poor diagnostic performance of median SWS in discerning no, equivocal, or definite urinary tract obstruction (area under the ROC curve ranged from 0.50 to 0.62).US SWS measurements did not enable discrimination of obstructive hydronephrosis from unobstructive hydronephrosis in children.",
        "History A 50-year-old woman presented to the emergency department of our hospital with a 2-day history of lower limb pain associated with unusual asthenia and diffuse arthralgia over the past 3 weeks. She was a native of Guinea and had lived in France for most of her life, working as a personal care assistant. Her only medical history of note was an occurrence of fetal death at 12 weeks gestation when she was 35 years old. She had bilateral lower limb swelling, without changes in skin temperature or color. All proximal and distal arterial pulses were felt. General physical examination findings were otherwise unremarkable. Her laboratory tests showed a decreased hemoglobin concentration of 8.9 g/dL (normal range, 12\u201316 g/dL), a decreased platelet count of 45 \u00d7 109/L (normal range, 150\u2013400 \u00d7 109/L), a C-reactive protein level of 158 mg/L (normal range, <5 mg/L) and a d-dimer level of 2000 mg/L (normal range, <500 mg/L). Compression US of the lower limbs revealed bilateral calf vein thrombosis involving the fibular and posterior tibial veins. Curative anticoagulation using low-molecular-weight heparin (enoxaparin, subcutaneous injection of 100 units per kilogram of body weight twice a day) was started. The day after the start of anticoagulation therapy, the patient reported dyspnea and acute chest and abdominal pain. Her vital signs were assessed, and she had elevated blood pressure and increased heart rate and respiratory rate, but she remained afebrile. Her cardiac auscultation was unremarkable, besides tachycardia. Skin examination revealed small areas of necrosis on the fingertips of her right hand. Laboratory studies were repeated and showed an increase in serum creatinine level from a baseline value of 0.49 mg/dL to a new value of 1.01 mg/dL (normal range, 0.6\u20131.1 mg/dL), an apparition of low-grade proteinuria of 0.43 g per day (normal range, <0.3 g/day), and a high serum troponin level of 1066 ng/L (normal range, <14 ng/L), whereas electrocardiography showed no ST segment modification and echocardiography revealed a moderately altered left ventricular ejection fraction (45%). There was no coronary occlusion seen at emergency coronarography. Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed (Figs 1, 2) together with cardiac MRI (Figs 3, 4).",
        "Background Deep learning reconstruction (DLR) may improve image quality. However, its impact on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of the prostate has yet to be assessed. Purpose To determine whether DLR can improve image quality of diffusion-weighted MRI at b values ranging from 1000 sec/mm2 to 5000 sec/mm2 in patients with prostate cancer. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, images of the prostate obtained at DWI with a b value of 0 sec/mm2, DWI with a b value of 1000 sec/mm2 (DWI1000), DWI with a b value of 3000 sec/mm2 (DWI3000), and DWI with a b value of 5000 sec/mm2 (DWI5000) from consecutive patients with biopsy-proven cancer from January to June 2020 were reconstructed with and without DLR. Image quality was assessed using signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) from region-of-interest analysis and qualitatively assessed using a five-point visual scoring system (1 [very poor] to 5 [excellent]) for each high-b-value DWI sequence with and without DLR. The SNR, CNR, and visual score for DWI with and without DLR were compared with the paired t test and the Wilcoxon signed rank test with Bonferroni correction, respectively. Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) from DWI with and without DLR were also compared with the paired t test with Bonferroni correction. Results A total of 60 patients (mean age, 67 years; age range, 49\u201379 years) were analyzed. DWI with DLR showed significantly higher SNRs and CNRs than DWI without DLR (P < .001); for example, with DWI1000 the mean SNR was 38.7 \u00b1 0.6 versus 17.8 \u00b1 0.6, respectively (P < .001), and the mean CNR was 18.4 \u00b1 5.6 versus 7.4 \u00b1 5.6, respectively (P < .001). DWI with DLR also demonstrated higher qualitative image quality than DWI without DLR (mean score: 4.8 \u00b1 0.4 vs 4.0 \u00b1 0.7, respectively, with DWI1000 [P = .001], 3.8 \u00b1 0.7 vs 3.0 \u00b1 0.8 with DWI3000 [P = .002], and 3.1 \u00b1 0.8 vs 2.0 \u00b1 0.9 with DWI5000 [P < .001]). ADCs derived with and without DLR did not differ substantially (P > .99). Conclusion Deep learning reconstruction improves the image quality of diffusion-weighted MRI scans of prostate cancer with no impact on apparent diffusion coefficient quantitation with a 3.0-T MRI system. \u00a9 RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Background A high number of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia who had barotrauma related to invasive mechanical ventilation at the authors' institution were observed. Purpose To determine if the rate of barotrauma in patients with COVID-19 infection was greater than in other patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation at the authors' institution. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, clinical and imaging data of patients seen between March 1, 2020, and April 6, 2020, who tested positive for COVID-19 and experienced barotrauma associated with invasive mechanical ventilation, were compared with patients without COVID-19 infection during the same period. Historical comparison was made to barotrauma rates of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome from February 1, 2016, to February 1, 2020, at the authors' institution. Comparison of patient groups was performed using categoric or continuous statistical testing as appropriate, with multivariable regression analysis. Patient survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves analysis. Results A total of 601 patients with COVID-19 infection underwent invasive mechanical ventilation (mean age, 63 years \u00b1 15 [standard deviation]; 71% men). Of the total, there were 89 (15%) patients with one or more barotrauma events for a total of 145 barotrauma events (24% overall events) (95% confidence interval [CI]: 21%, 28%). During the same period, 196 patients without COVID-19 infection (mean age, 64 years \u00b1 19; 52% men) with invasive mechanical ventilation had one barotrauma event (0.5%; 95% CI: 0%, 3%;",
        "To compare changes in signal intensity (SI) ratios of the dentate nucleus (DN) and the globus pallidus (GP) to those of other structures on unenhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images between linear and macrocyclic gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs).The study was approved by the ethical committee of the University of Heidelberg (reference no. S-324/2014). Owing to the retrospective character of the study, the ethical committee did not require any written informed consent. Two groups of 50 patients who underwent at least six consecutive MR imaging examinations with the exclusive use of either a linear GBCA (gadopentetate dimeglumine) or a macrocyclic GBCA (gadoterate meglumine) were analyzed retrospectively. The difference in mean SI ratios of DN to pons and GP to thalamus on unenhanced T1-weighted images from the last and first examinations was calculated. One-sample and independent-sample t tests were used to assess the difference in SI ratios for both groups, and regression analysis was performed to account for potential confounders.The SI ratio difference in the linear group was greater than 0 (mean DN difference \u00b1 standard deviation, 0.0407 \u00b1 0.0398 [P < .001]; GP, 0.0287 \u00b1 0.0275 [P < .001]) and significantly larger (DN, P < .001 and standardized difference of 1.16; GP, P < .001 and standardized difference of 0.81) than that in the macrocyclic group, which did not differ from 0 (DN, 0.0016 \u00b1 0.0266 [P = .680]; GP, 0.0031 \u00b1 0.0354 [P = .538]). The SI ratio difference between the last and first examinations for the DN remained significantly different between the two groups in the regression analysis (P < .001).This study indicates that an SI increase in the DN and GP on T1-weighted images is caused by serial application of the linear GBCA gadopentetate dimeglumine but not by the macrocyclic GBCA gadoterate meglumine. Clinical implications of this observation remain unclear.",
        "Purpose To compare hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development after radiofrequency (RF) ablation, partial surgical hepatectomy, and a sham operation and to inhibit HCC recurrence after RF ablation in a mouse model of spontaneously forming HCC in the setting of chronic inflammation (ie, the MDR2 knockout model). Materials and Methods Animal experiments were performed according to an approved animal care committee protocol. The authors compared the survival of MDR2 knockout mice (an inflammation-induced HCC model) that underwent RF ablation, 35% partial hepatectomy (ie, left lobectomy), or a sham operation (controls) by using Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis. Tumor load and tumor frequency in mice that underwent sham operation were further compared with those of mice treated with RF ablation at 1 month after therapy by using a two-tailed Student t test. Liver slices from mice treated with RF ablation were stained for \u03b1\u2212smooth muscle actin and Ki-67 to establish the role of liver regeneration in the tumorigenic effect of RF ablation. Finally, tumor load and tumor incidence were evaluated in mice treated with a c-met inhibitor after RF ablation by using the Mann-Whitney U test. Results Ablation of 3.5% \u00b1 0.02 of the MDR2 knockout mice liver induced increased tumor load (P = .007) and reduced survival (P = .03) in comparison to that of controls, with no significant difference to the 10-fold volume removal of partial hepatectomy. Seven days after RF treatment, the border zone of the coagulation zone was surrounded by \u03b1\u2212smooth muscle actin\u2013positive activated myofibroblasts. A significant elevation of hepatocyte proliferation was also seen 7 days after RF ablation in the distant liver (ablated lobe: P = .003; untreated lobe: P = .02). A c-met inhibitor significantly attenuated HCC development in MDR2 knockout mice treated with RF ablation (P = .001). Conclusion Liver regeneration induced by RF ablation facilitates c-met/hepatocyte growth factor axis\u2013dependent HCC tumor formation after treatment in the MDR2 knockout model. Blockage of the c-met/hepatocyte growth factor axis attenuates HCC recurrence, raising the potential for therapeutic intervention to reverse this potentially deleterious tumorigenic effect. \u00a9 RSNA, 2015",
        "Purpose To identify quantitative imaging biomarkers at fluorine 18 ((18)F) positron emission tomography (PET) for predicting distant metastasis in patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Materials and Methods In this institutional review board-approved HIPAA-compliant retrospective study, the pretreatment (18)F fluorodeoxyglucose PET images in 101 patients treated with stereotactic ablative radiation therapy from 2005 to 2013 were analyzed. Data for 70 patients who were treated before 2011 were used for discovery purposes, while data from the remaining 31 patients were used for independent validation. Quantitative PET imaging characteristics including statistical, histogram-related, morphologic, and texture features were analyzed, from which 35 nonredundant and robust features were further evaluated. Cox proportional hazards regression model coupled with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was used to predict distant metastasis. Whether histologic type provided complementary value to imaging by combining both in a single prognostic model was also assessed. Results The optimal prognostic model included two image features that allowed quantification of intratumor heterogeneity and peak standardized uptake value. In the independent validation cohort, this model showed a concordance index of 0.71, which was higher than those of the maximum standardized uptake value and tumor volume, with concordance indexes of 0.67 and 0.64, respectively. The prognostic model also allowed separation of groups with low and high risk for developing distant metastasis (hazard ratio, 4.8; P = .0498, log-rank test), which compared favorably with maximum standardized uptake value and tumor volume (hazard ratio, 1.5 and 2.0, respectively; P = .73 and 0.54, log-rank test, respectively). When combined with histologic types, the prognostic power was further improved (hazard ratio, 6.9; P = .0289, log-rank test; and concordance index, 0.80). Conclusion PET imaging characteristics associated with distant metastasis that could potentially help practitioners to tailor appropriate therapy for individual patients with early-stage NSCLC were identified.

        "To compare magnetic resonance (MR) elastography and ultrasonographic shear-wave elastography ( SWE shear-wave elastography ) for the staging of hepatic fibrosis ( HF hepatic fibrosis ) in the same individuals.This prospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. The technical success of and reliable liver stiffness ( LS liver stiffness ) measurement rates at MR elastography and SWE shear-wave elastography were compared in 129 patients who underwent both examinations. For mutual validation, LS liver stiffness values measured at both examinations were correlated by using Pearson correlation. The diagnostic performance of the two techniques for the assessment of substantial HF hepatic fibrosis (stage \u2265 F2) was compared by using nonparametric receiver operating characteristic analysis.The technical success rates of MR elastography and SWE shear-wave elastography were 95.35% (123 of 129) and 97.67% (126 of 129), respectively (P = .51). MR elastography provided significantly more reliable LS liver stiffness measurements than did SWE shear-wave elastography (95.35% [123 of 129] vs 75.2% [97 of 129], P < .001). The two examinations showed moderate correlation (r = 0.724). In patients with HF hepatic fibrosis stages of F3 or lower, the two examinations showed moderate-to-strong correlation (r = 0.683 in normal livers, 0.754 in livers with stage F0 or F1 HF hepatic fibrosis , and 0.90 in livers with stage F2 or F3 HF hepatic fibrosis ; P < .001); however, they did not show significant correlation for stage F4 HF hepatic fibrosis (r = 0.30, P = .31). MR elastography and SWE shear-wave elastography showed similar diagnostic capability in depicting HF hepatic fibrosis of stage F2 or greater (P = .98) when LS liver stiffness measurements were reliably performed.MR elastography and SWE shear-wave elastography showed moderate correlation and similar diagnostic performance in the diagnosis of HF hepatic fibrosis of stage F2 or greater; however, MR elastography yielded more reliable LS liver stiffness measurements than did SWE shear-wave elastography .",
        "To evaluate the diagnostic yield of recommended chest computed tomography (CT) prompted by abnormalities detected on outpatient chest radiographic images.This HIPAA-compliant study had institutional review board approval; informed consent was waived. Reports of all outpatient chest radiographic examinations performed at a large academic center during 2008 (n = 29 138) were queried to identify studies that included a recommendation for a chest CT imaging. The radiology information system was queried for these patients to determine if a chest CT examination was obtained within 1 year of the index radiographic examination that contained the recommendation. For chest CT examinations obtained within 1 year of the index chest radiographic examination and that met inclusion criteria, chest CT images were reviewed to determine if there was an abnormality that corresponded to the chest radiographic finding that prompted the recommendation. All corresponding abnormalities were categorized as clinically relevant or not clinically relevant, based on whether further work-up or treatment was warranted. Groups were compared by using t test and Fisher exact test with a Bonferroni correction applied for multiple comparisons.There were 4.5% (1316 of 29138 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 4.3%, 4.8%]) of outpatient chest radiographic examinations that contained a recommendation for chest CT examination, and increasing patient age (P < .001) and positive smoking history (P = .001) were associated with increased likelihood of a recommendation for chest CT examination. Of patients within this subset who met inclusion criteria, 65.4% (691 of 1057 [95% CI: 62.4%, 68.2%) underwent a chest CT examination within the year after the index chest radiographic examination. Clinically relevant corresponding abnormalities were present on chest CT images in 41.4% (286 of 691 [95% CI: 37.7%, 45.2%]) of cases, nonclinically relevant corresponding abnormalities in 20.6% (142 of 691 [95% CI: 17.6%, 23.8%]) of cases, and no corresponding abnormalities in 38.1% (263 of 691 [95% CI: 34.4%, 41.8%]) of cases. Newly diagnosed, biopsy-proven malignancies were detected in 8.1% (56 of 691 [95% CI: 6.2%, 10.4%]) of cases.A radiologist recommendation for chest CT to evaluate an abnormal finding on an outpatient chest radiographic examination has a high yield of clinically relevant findings.",
        "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global health care emergency. Although reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction testing is the reference standard method to identify patients with COVID-19 infection, chest radiography and CT play a vital role in the detection and management of these patients. Prediction models for COVID-19 imaging are rapidly being developed to support medical decision making. However, inadequate availability of a diverse annotated data set has limited the performance and generalizability of existing models. To address this unmet need, the RSNA and Society of Thoracic Radiology collaborated to develop the RSNA International COVID-19 Open Radiology Database (RICORD). This database is the first multi-institutional, multinational, expert-annotated COVID-19 imaging data set. It is made freely available to the machine learning community as a research and educational resource for COVID-19 chest imaging. Pixel-level volumetric segmentation with clinical annotations was performed by thoracic radiology subspecialists for all COVID-19\u2013positive thoracic CT scans. The labeling schema was coordinated with other international consensus panels and COVID-19 data annotation efforts, the European Society of Medical Imaging Informatics, the American College of Radiology, and the American Association of Physicists in Medicine. Study-level COVID-19 classification labels for chest radiographs were annotated by three radiologists, with majority vote adjudication by board-certified radiologists. RICORD consists of 240 thoracic CT scans and 1000 chest radiographs contributed from four international sites. It is anticipated that RICORD will ideally lead to prediction models that can demonstrate sustained performance across populations and health care systems. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "To examine the factors that affect inter- and intraobserver agreement for pulmonary nodule type classification on low-radiation-dose computed tomographic (CT) images, and their potential effect on patient management.Nodules (n = 160) were randomly selected from the Dutch-Belgian Lung Cancer Screening Trial cohort, with equal numbers of nodule types and similar sizes. Nodules were scored by eight radiologists by using morphologic categories proposed by the Fleischner Society guidelines for management of pulmonary nodules as solid, part solid with a solid component smaller than 5 mm, part solid with a solid component 5 mm or larger, or pure ground glass. Inter- and intraobserver agreement was analyzed by using Cohen \u03ba statistics. Multivariate analysis of variance was performed to assess the effect of nodule characteristics and image quality on observer disagreement. Effect on nodule management was estimated by differentiating CT follow-up for ground-glass nodules, solid nodules 8 mm or smaller, and part-solid nodules smaller than 5 mm from immediate diagnostic work-up for solid nodules larger than 8 mm and part-solid nodules 5 mm or greater.Pair-wise inter- and intraobserver agreement was moderate (mean \u03ba, 0.51 [95% confidence interval, 0.30, 0.68] and 0.57 [95% confidence interval, 0.47, 0.71]). Categorization as part-solid nodules and location in the upper lobe significantly reduced observer agreement (P = .012 and P < .001, respectively). By considering all possible reading pairs (28 possible combinations of observer pairs \u00d7 160 nodules = 4480 possible agreements or disagreements), a discordant nodule classification was found in 36.4% (1630 of 4480), related to presence or size of a solid component in 88.7% (1446 of 1630). Two-thirds of these discrepant readings (1061 of 1630) would have potentially resulted in different nodule management.There is moderate inter- and intraobserver agreement for nodule classification by using current recommendations for low-radiation-dose CT examinations of the chest. Discrepancies in nodule categorization were mainly caused by disagreement on the size and presence of a solid component, which may lead to different management in the majority of cases with such discrepancies.

        "Purpose To determine whether two-view shear-wave elastography (SWE) improves the performance of radiologists in differentiating benign from malignant breast masses compared with single-view SWE. Materials and Methods This prospective study was conducted with institutional review board approval, and written informed consent was obtained. B-mode ultrasonographic (US) and orthogonal SWE images were obtained for 219 breast masses (136 benign and 83 malignant; mean size, 14.8 mm) in 219 consecutive women (mean age, 47.9 years; range, 20-78 years). Five blinded radiologists independently assessed the likelihood of malignancy for three data sets: B-mode US alone, B-mode US and single-view SWE, and B-mode US and two-view SWE. Interobserver agreement regarding Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) category and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of each data set were compared. Results Interobserver agreement was moderate (\u03ba = 0.560 \u00b1 0.015 [standard error of the mean]) for BI-RADS category assessment with B-mode US alone. When SWE was added to B-mode US, five readers showed substantial interobserver agreement (\u03ba = 0.629 \u00b1 0.017 for single-view SWE; \u03ba = 0.651 \u00b1 0.014 for two-view SWE). The mean AUC of B-mode US was 0.870 (range, 0.855-0.884). The AUC of B-mode US and two-view SWE (average, 0.928; range, 0.904-0.941) was higher than that of B-mode US and single-view SWE (average, 0.900; range, 0.890-0.920), with statistically significant differences for three readers (P \u2264 .003). Conclusion The performance of radiologists in differentiating benign from malignant breast masses was improved when B-mode US was combined with two-view SWE compared with that when B-mode US was combined with single-view SWE. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Supplemental material: S1.",
        "History A 54-year-old woman presented with typical chest pain during physical training at the gym. She had a history of hypertension controlled with hydrochlorothiazide, without any other cardiovascular risk factor and with neither personal nor family history of ischemic heart disease. She was postmenopausal and had a long-standing history of migraine headaches without hormonal or drug therapy. The patient had no history of clinically important thoracic trauma or invasive chest interventions. Initial electrocardiography (ECG) showed signs of ongoing anterior ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, and emergent coronary angiography with angioplasty and intravascular US were performed ( Fig 1 ). Maximal level of high-sensitive T troponins was 820 ng/L (normal, <13 ng/L), while echocardiography showed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction, with no apparent regional wall motion abnormalities. General physical examination findings were unremarkable, excluding ligamentous hyperlaxity and joint instability. C-reactive protein, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, and angiotensin-converting enzyme blood test results were negative. For further evaluation, arterial phase ECG-synchronized CT angiography from the skull base to the pubis symphysis was performed ( Fig 2 ).

        "To investigate the ability of contrast material-enhanced ultrasonography (US) to help diagnose obstruction of middle hepatic venous (MHV) tributaries soon after living-donor liver transplantation with modified right lobe grafts.The institutional review board approved the study and waived requirement for informed consent. Sixty-five consecutive patients (48 men, 17 women; mean age, 52.8 years; range, 33-69 years) who underwent living-donor liver transplantation with modified right lobe grafts between February and May 2009 were included. All patients underwent contrast-enhanced US and Doppler US on postoperative day 1 and underwent computed tomography (CT) within 7 days after US. At contrast-enhanced US, parenchymal enhancement patterns in the territory of each MHV tributary during arterial and portal venous phases were evaluated. With use of most frequent enhancement patterns in patients with obstruction at MHV tributaries as a criterion, diagnostic performance of contrast-enhanced US was compared with that of Doppler US for diagnosis of obstruction at MHV tributaries; CT was the reference standard. Generalized estimating equations were used to adjust for data clustering.Of 148 MHV tributaries in 65 patients, 36 (24.3%) in 31 patients were diagnosed as obstructed at CT. With arterial high echogenicity or portal low echogenicity used as a criterion for hepatic venous obstruction, contrast-enhanced US had sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 91% (33 of 36), 97% (109 of 112), and 95% (142 of 148), respectively, whereas Doppler US had values of 83% (30 of 36), 86% (97 of 112), and 85% (127 of 148), respectively. Contrast-enhanced US was significantly more specific and accurate than Doppler US for diagnosis of obstruction at MHV tributaries (P=.024 and .01, respectively). Arterial high echogenicity was noted only in the hepatic venous obstruction group.Contrast-enhanced US can help accurately assess hepatic venous obstruction at MHV tributaries after living-donor liver transplantation with a modified right lobe graft. Contrast-enhanced US was significantly more specific than Doppler US, with arterial hyperenhancement in the affected area being specific to hepatic venous obstruction.",
        "Purpose To assess the safety and efficacy of ultrasonography (US)-guided suprapubic transvaginal (ST) radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the treatment of symptomatic uterine leiomyomas at 1-year follow-up. Materials and Methods The institutional review board approved this prospective study, and all patients provided informed consent. ST RFA was performed as an outpatient procedure 3 days after menstruation in 51 women (age range, 32-52 years; mean age, 42.2 years) with 62 leiomyomas. The leiomyomas were assessed with conventional and contrast material-enhanced US before and after ST RFA for leiomyoma size, location, and blood flow. All patients were evaluated for postoperative complications, including abdominal pain, injury to surrounding tissues and organs, vaginal bleeding, increased vaginal discharge, fever, dyspnea, and menorrhagia, after ST RFA and at follow-up visits. The leiomyoma volumes, improvement in leiomyoma-related symptoms, effect on quality of life (QOL), and patient satisfaction were assessed and compared before and after ST RFA and at follow-up visits by using statistical analyses. Results Sixty-two leiomyomas were successfully treated with ST RFA until 90% of the leiomyoma was echogenic. At 1-month follow-up, 46 (74%) leiomyomas had no contrast enhancement, five (8%) had peripheral enhancement, eight (13%) had focal enhancement, and three (5%) had scattered enhancement at contrast-enhanced US. At 6-month follow-up, the number of leiomyomas that had no enhancement, peripheral enhancement, focal enhancement, or scattered enhancement was 43 (69%), seven (11%), nine (15%), and three (5%), respectively. The leiomyoma volumes were significantly (P < .05) reduced at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up (from 33.0 cm(3) \u00b1 25.1 [standard deviation] before treatment to 6.8 cm(3) \u00b1 7.7 at 12-month follow-up). The mean percentage volume reduction at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up was 28%, 57%, 63%, and 78%, respectively. The scores for symptoms and QOL were all significantly improved (P < .05) at follow-up, going from 45 \u00b1 14 and 65 \u00b1 41, respectively, before treatment to 0 and 100, respectively, at 12-month follow-up. No complications were reported during the periprocedural period or throughout follow-up. Most patients (41 of 45) were satisfied.

        "Background Reliable predictive imaging markers of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors are needed. Purpose To develop and validate a pretreatment CT-based radiomics signature to predict response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in advanced solid tumors. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, a radiomics signature was developed in patients with advanced solid tumors (including breast, cervix, gastrointestinal) treated with anti-programmed cell death-1 or programmed cell death ligand-1 monotherapy from August 2012 to May 2018 (cohort 1). This was tested in patients with bladder and lung cancer (cohorts 2 and 3). Radiomics variables were extracted from all metastases delineated at pretreatment CT and selected by using an elastic-net model. A regression model combined radiomics and clinical variables with response as the end point. Biologic validation of the radiomics score with RNA profiling of cytotoxic cells (cohort 4) was assessed with Mann-Whitney analysis. Results The radiomics signature was developed in 85 patients (cohort 1: mean age, 58 years \u00b1 13 [standard deviation]; 43 men) and tested on 46 patients (cohort 2: mean age, 70 years \u00b1 12; 37 men) and 47 patients (cohort 3: mean age, 64 years \u00b1 11; 40 men). Biologic validation was performed in a further cohort of 20 patients (cohort 4: mean age, 60 years \u00b1 13; 14 men). The radiomics signature was associated with clinical response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (area under the curve [AUC], 0.70; 95% CI: 0.64, 0.77; P < .001). In cohorts 2 and 3, the AUC was 0.67 (95% CI: 0.58, 0.76) and 0.67 (95% CI: 0.56, 0.77; P < .001), respectively.

A cohort of 26 370 subjects was retrospectively collected from a radiology archive of CT examinations of the head performed from 1973 through 1992. For comparison, an age- and sex-matched cohort of 96 940 subjects who were not exposed to CT (unexposed cohort) was gathered. The risk of meningioma was assessed by using data from the Swedish Cancer Registry; however, one-third of patients with meningioma had to be excluded because they either had a prevalent meningioma or other brain tumor at the first CT examination or had undergone radiation treatment to the head. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated from time of exposure to the occurrence of meningioma or death or until December 31, 2010, with logistic regression. Results Comparison of exposed and unexposed cohorts showed that there was no statistically significant increase in the risk of meningioma after exposure to CT of the head (HR: 1.49; 95% confidence interval: 0.97, 2.30; P = .07). If incident cases at the time of the first CT examination were not excluded, the risk of meningioma would have been falsely increased (HR: 2.28; 95% confidence interval: 1.56, 3.33; P = .0001). Conclusion When prevalent cases of meningioma at first exposure to CT of the head are excluded, no statistically significant increase in risk of meningioma was found among exposed subjects compared with unexposed control subjects. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017",
        "Background Post-COVID-19 condition encompasses symptoms following COVID-19 infection that linger at least 4 weeks after the end of active infection. Symptoms are wide ranging, but breathlessness is common. Purpose To determine if the previously described lung abnormalities seen on hyperpolarized (HP) pulmonary xenon 129 (129Xe) MRI scans in participants with post-COVID-19 condition who were hospitalized are also present in participants with post-COVID-19 condition who were not hospitalized. Materials and Methods In this prospective study, nonhospitalized participants with post-COVID-19 condition (NHLC) and posthospitalized participants with post-COVID-19 condition (PHC) were enrolled from June 2020 to August 2021. Participants underwent chest CT, HP 129Xe MRI, pulmonary function testing, and the 1-minute sit-to-stand test and completed breathlessness questionnaires. Control subjects underwent HP 129Xe MRI only. CT scans were analyzed for post-COVID-19 interstitial lung disease severity using a previously published scoring system and full-scale airway network (FAN) modeling. Analysis used group and pairwise comparisons between participants and control subjects and correlations between participant clinical and imaging data. Results A total of 11 NHLC participants (four men, seven women; mean age, 44 years \u00b1 11 [SD]; 95% CI: 37, 50) and 12 PHC participants (10 men, two women; mean age, 58 years \u00b110; 95% CI: 52, 64) were included, with a significant difference in age between groups (P = .05). Mean time from infection was 287 days \u00b1 79 (95% CI: 240, 334) and 143 days \u00b1 72 (95% CI: 105, 190) in NHLC and PHC participants, respectively. NHLC and PHC participants had normal or near normal CT scans (mean, 0.3/25 \u00b1 0.6 [95% CI: 0, 0.63] and 7/25 \u00b1 5 [95% CI: 4, 10], respectively). Gas transfer (Dlco) was different between NHLC and PHC participants (mean Dlco, 76% \u00b1 8 [95% CI: 73, 83] vs 86% \u00b1 8 [95% CI: 80, 91], respectively; P = .04), but there was no evidence of other differences in lung function. Mean red blood cell-to-tissue plasma ratio was different between volunteers (mean, 0.45 \u00b1 0.07; 95% CI: 0.43, 0.47]) and PHC participants (mean, 0.31 \u00b1 0.10; 95% CI: 0.24, 0.37; P = .02) and between volunteers and NHLC participants (mean, 0.37 \u00b1 0.10; 95% CI: 0.31, 0.44; P = .03) but not between NHLC and PHC participants (P = .26). FAN results did not correlate with Dlco) or HP 129Xe MRI results. Conclusion Nonhospitalized participants with post-COVID-19 condition (NHLC) and posthospitalized participants with post-COVID-19 condition (PHC) showed hyperpolarized pulmonary xenon 129 MRI and red blood cell-to-tissue plasma abnormalities, with NHLC participants demonstrating lower gas transfer than PHC participants despite having normal CT findings. \u00a9 RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "To estimate the long-term (29-year) effect of mammographic screening on breast cancer mortality in terms of both relative and absolute effects.This study was carried out under the auspices of the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare. The board determined that, because randomization was at a community level and was to invitation to screening, informed verbal consent could be given by the participants when they attended the screening examination. A total of 133 065 women aged 40-74 years residing in two Swedish counties were randomized into a group invited to mammographic screening and a control group receiving usual care. Case status and cause of death were determined by the local trial end point committees and, independently, by an external committee. Mortality analysis was performed by using negative binomial regression.There was a highly significant reduction in breast cancer mortality in women invited to screening according to both local end point committee data (relative risk [RR] = 0.69; 95% confidence interval: 0.56, 0.84; P < .0001) and consensus data (RR = 0.73; 95% confidence interval: 0.59, 0.89; P = .002). At 29 years of follow-up, the number of women needed to undergo screening for 7 years to prevent one breast cancer death was 414 according to local data and 519 according to consensus data. Most prevented breast cancer deaths would have occurred (in the absence of screening) after the first 10 years of follow-up.Invitation to mammographic screening results in a highly significant decrease in breast cancer-specific mortality. Evaluation of the full impact of screening, in particular estimates of absolute benefit and number needed to screen, requires follow-up times exceeding 20 years because the observed number of breast cancer deaths prevented increases with increasing time of follow-up.",
        "Purpose To determine the degree of preoperative fatty degeneration within muscles, postoperative longitudinal changes in fatty degeneration, and differences in fatty degeneration between patients with full-thickness supraspinatus tears who do and those who do not experience a retear after surgery. Materials and Methods This prospective study had institutional review board approval and was conducted in accordance with the Committee for Human Research. Informed consent was obtained. Fifty patients with full-thickness supraspinatus tears (18 men, 32 women; mean age, 67.0 years \u00b1 8.0; age range, 41\u201391 years) were recruited. The degrees of preoperative and postoperative fatty degeneration were quantified by using a two-point Dixon magnetic resonance (MR) imaging sequence; two radiologists measured the mean signal intensity on in-phase [S(In)] and fat [S(Fat)] images. Estimates of fatty degeneration were calculated with \"fat fraction\" values by using the formula S(Fat)/S(In) within the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and subscapularis muscles at baseline preoperative and at postoperative 1-year follow-up MR imaging. Preoperative fat fractions in the failed-repair group and the intact-repair group were compared by using the Mann-Whitney U test. Results The preoperative fat fractions in the supraspinatus muscle were significantly higher in the failed-repair group than in the intact-repair group (37.0% vs 19.5%, P < .001). Fatty degeneration of the supraspinatus muscle tended to progress at 1 year postoperatively in only the failed-repair group. Conclusion MR imaging quantification of preoperative fat fractions by using a two-point Dixon sequence within the rotator cuff muscles may be a viable method for predicting postoperative retear. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016",
        "To determine whether multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging can help identify patients with prostate cancer who would most appropriately be candidates for active surveillance (AS) according to current guidelines and to compare the results with those of conventional clinical assessment scoring systems, including the D'Amico, Epstein, and Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) systems, on the basis of findings at prostatectomy.This institutional review board-approved HIPAA-compliant retrospectively designed study included 133 patients (mean age, 59.3 years) with a mean prostate-specific antigen level of 6.73 ng/mL (median, 4.39 ng/mL) who underwent multiparametric MR imaging at 3.0 T before radical prostatectomy. Informed consent was obtained from all patients. Patients were then retrospectively classified as to whether they would have met AS eligibility criteria or were better served by surgery. AS eligibility criteria for prostatectomy specimens were a dominant tumor smaller than 0.5 mL without Gleason 4 or 5 patterns or extracapsular or seminal vesicle invasion. Conventional clinical assessment scores (the D'Amico, Epstein, and CAPRA scoring systems) were compared with multiparametric MR imaging findings for predicting AS candidates. The level of significance of difference between scoring systems was determined by using the \u03c7(2) test for categoric variables with the level of significance set at P < .05.Among 133 patients, 14 were eligible for AS on the basis of prostatectomy results. The sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), and overall accuracy, respectively, were 93%, 25%, and 70% for the D'Amico system, 64%, 45%, and 88% for the Epstein criteria, and 93%, 20%, and 59% for the CAPRA scoring system for predicting AS candidates (P < .005 for all, \u03c7(2) test), while multiparametric MR imaging had a sensitivity of 93%, a PPV of 57%, and an overall accuracy of 92% (P < .005).Multiparametric MR imaging provides useful additional information to existing clinicopathologic scoring systems of prostate cancer and improves the assignment of treatment (eg, AS or active treatment).",
        "To investigate factors influencing the quality of ultrasonographic (US) elastography in the evaluation of suspicious breast masses.This prospective study was conducted with institutional review board approval; written informed consent was obtained. Between January 2009 and February 2009, real-time US elastography of 312 breast masses (245 benign, 67 malignant) was performed in 268 consecutive patients (mean age, 45.7 years \u00b1 10.2 [standard deviation]) prior to US-guided core biopsy. Five breast radiologists who had performed the examinations assessed the quality of elasticity images as inadequate, low, or high without histologic information. Age, body mass index (BMI), mammographic density, lesion size, lesion depth, and breast thickness at US were analyzed for their association with image quality by using the \u03c7(2) test, Student t test, and multivariate analysis. Sensitivities and specificities for the differentiation of benign from malignant masses on the basis of elastography were calculated and compared between groups of quality scores by using the logistic regression method.The quality of elasticity images was assessed as inadequate in 21 (6.7%) cases, low in 134 (42.9%), and high in 157 (50.3%). According to univariate analysis, smaller lesion size (P = .001), shallower lesion depth (P = .005), less breast thickness where the lesion was located (P < .0001), and benign pathologic finding (P = .004) were significantly associated with higher image quality. There was no correlation of image quality with age (P = .213), BMI (P = .191), mammographic density (P = .091), or distance from the nipple (P = .100). Multivariable analysis showed that breast thickness at the location of target lesions was the most important factor influencing elasticity image quality (P = .001). There were significant differences in sensitivity between higher-quality and lower-quality images (87.0% vs 56.8%, respectively; P = .015) in the differentiation of benign from malignant masses.Breast thickness at the location of the lesion was the most important factor influencing image quality at US elastography. Sensitivity for classification of benign and malignant masses improved with higher quality scores.",
        "The overlap of early Ebola virus disease (EVD) symptoms (eg, fever, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, emesis, and fatigue) with symptoms of other more common travel-related diseases (eg, malaria, typhoid fever, pneumonia, and meningococcemia) may result in delayed diagnosis of EVD before isolation of infected patients. Radiology departments should consider policies for and approaches to decontamination of expensive and potentially easily damaged radiology equipment. In addition, the protection of radiology personnel must be considered during the work-up phase of undiagnosed EVD patients presenting to emergency departments. The purpose of this article is to consider the effect of EVD on radiology departments and imaging equipment, with particular consideration of guidelines currently available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that may be applicable to radiology.",
        "To compare neoplastic and nonneoplastic disease in the anterior extradural space (AES) with regard to the contour of the disease and the tethering of the central septum, as seen on axial magnetic resonance (MR) images.In this institutional review board-approved HIPAA-compliant study, the data of patients who had AES disease determined at MR imaging and underwent diagnostic biopsy were studied. Two blinded observers reviewed the MR images and assigned the patients to one of two groups on the basis of the contour of AES disease: those with a centrally convex disease contour posteriorly and those whose disease contour was tethered in the midline to the posterior aspect of the vertebral body. Biopsy results served as the standard of reference. The two-tailed Fisher exact test, the Breslow-Day test, and \u03ba statistics were used to compare groups. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the midline tethered contour of AES disease for the detection of neoplasm were calculated.The data of 32 patients (16 men, 16 women; mean age, 68 years) were studied. Seventeen patients had malignant epidural disease. Fifteen patients had nonneoplastic epidural disease: Six patients had hematomas, and nine had abscesses. A greater proportion of AES neoplasms (13 [76%] and 14 [82%] of 17 lesions for observers 1 and 2, respectively) than nonneoplastic AES lesions (four [27%] and three [20%] of 15 lesions for observers 1 and 2, respectively) demonstrated midline tethering of the central septum. For observers 1 and 2, a unilobed or bilobed appearance of AES disease had sensitivities of 76% (13 of 17 lesions) and 82% (14 of 17 lesions), respectively; specificities of 73% (11 of 15 lesions) and 80% (12 of 15 lesions), respectively; and accuracies of 75% (24 of 32 lesions) and 81% (26 of 32 lesions), respectively, for the detection of neoplasm. The mean \u03ba value for interobserver variability was 0.62 (95% confidence interval: 0.35, 0.90).AES disease preserving the midline tethering of the central septum is more common with neoplastic disease than with infections or hematomas.",
        "History A 30-year-old woman with polycystic ovarian syndrome who was undergoing hormone replacement therapy presented with a 6-month history of a nonproductive cough and a 1-day history of hemoptysis (approximately 20 mL). Intravenous contrast material\u2013enhanced (100 mL of Omnipaque 350; GE Healthcare, Princeton, NJ) computed tomographic (CT) pulmonary angiography was performed to evaluate for pulmonary embolism. On the basis of the CT pulmonary angiographic findings, chromogranin A and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels were measured and were 7 nmol/L (343 \u00b5g/L) (high) and 2.9 mg per 24 hours (15.167 \u00b5mol/d) (normal), respectively. This patient underwent bronchoscopy and biopsy.

        "Background Diagnosis of chylous effusions normally requires invasive paracentesis. Purpose To assess whether MRI with multipoint Dixon fat quantification allows for noninvasive differentiation of chylous and nonchylous ascites and pleural effusions. Materials and Methods Phantom, ex vivo, and in vivo MRI examinations were performed by using a commercially available multipoint Dixon pulse sequence with a 1.5-T MRI system. Fat fraction values were measured with a region of interest\u2013based approach on reconstructed maps. For phantom evaluation, eight titrated fatty fluid solutions (nonhuman samples) with varying triglyceride content (145\u201319 000 mg/dL [1.64\u2013214.7 mmol/L]) were examined. For ex vivo evaluation, 15 chylous and five nonchylous study participant fluid samples were examined. In a prospective study performed from June 2016 to February 2018, 29 study participants with known chylous (n = 17) and nonchylous (n = 12) effusions were evaluated with MRI. All clinical samples underwent laboratory testing for triglyceride level, total protein level, white blood cells, and red blood cells. Laboratory values were correlated with fat fraction values; the optimal fat fraction threshold was determined to differentiate chylous and nonchylous fluids. Results Phantom analysis showed that fat fraction values correlated with triglyceride content (r = 0.99, P < .001). In ex vivo studies, multipoint Dixon-derived fat fraction was higher in chylous versus nonchylous fluids (mean, 2.5% \u00b1 1.2 [standard deviation] vs 0.8% \u00b1 0.2; P = .001). Fat fraction was correlated with triglyceride content (r = 0.96, P < .001). For in vivo studies, fat fraction was greater for chylous versus nonchylous fluids (mean, 6.2% \u00b1 4.3 vs 0.6% \u00b1 0.6; P < .001). In vivo fat fraction was correlated with triglyceride content (r = 0.96, P < .001). Use of a fat fraction cutoff value greater than 1.8% yielded a sensitivity of 14 of 17 (82% [95% confidence interval (CI): 57%, 97%]) and a specificity of 12 of 12 (100% [95% CI: 74%, 100%]) for differentiation of chylous and nonchylous effusions. Conclusion MRI can help identify chylous versus nonchylous ascites and pleural effusions through use of multipoint Dixon fat quantification. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "History In 2017, a 72-year-old woman was seen in the gastroenterology department with a 2-month history of mild and intermittent abdominal pain without other accompanying symptoms. Her medical history was unremarkable, except for a previous visit due to facial photodermatitis 3 years earlier. Diazepam for a sleeping disorder was the only chronic medication recorded. Results of physical examination, blood count, and basic metabolic panels including assessment of renal and liver function were normal; only the ferritin level was slightly elevated (265 ng/mL [595 pmol/L]; normal range, 10-120 ng/mL [22-269 pmol/L]). Abdominal US was performed, followed by multiphasic contrast-enhanced CT and liver MRI due to the findings of the first study.

        "To determine the impact of cement placement immediately adjacent to and through the endplate during percutaneous vertebroplasty on postprocedural pain and subsequent fracture rate.Institutional review board approval with waived consent was obtained. Medical records of 424 patients undergoing first-time, single-level vertebroplasty for osteoporotic or traumatic compression fractures were examined. Data regarding pain at rest and with activity before the procedure, along with timing and level of subsequent fractures over a 24-month period, were collected. Group 1 (n=64) included patients with no cement extension to the endplate(s), group 2 (n=216) included those with cement extension to the endplate(s) but no leakage into the disk space(s), and group 3 (n=144) included those with cement extension to the endplate(s) and cement leakage into the disk space(s). Analysis of variance and Fisher test were used to analyze the data, with significance set at P<.05.Baseline characteristics and demographics were similar among the groups. At 1 month, for groups 1, 2, and 3, the respective mean postprocedural pain numeric scores at rest were 1.4\u00b12.7, 1.4\u00b12.4, and 1.6\u00b12.5 (P=.51), while the respective pain scores with activity were 4.3\u00b12.9, 3.8\u00b13.1, and 3.9\u00b13.3 (P=.50). Total subsequent fractures were noted in five (8%), 26 (12%), and 15 (10%) patients in group 1, 2, and 3, respectively (P=.77).Neither extension of cement to the endplate nor cement leakage into the disk space has significant impact on postprocedural pain or subsequent fracture rate at 2 years.",
        "To compare objective and subjective image quality parameters of three image reconstruction algorithms of different generations at routine multidetector computed tomographic (CT) examinations of the abdomen.This institutional review board-approved study included 22 consecutive patients (mean age, 56.1 years \u00b1 15.8 [standard deviation]; mean weight, 79.1 kg \u00b1 14.8) who underwent routine CT examinations of the abdomen. A low-contrast phantom was used for objective quality control. Raw data sets were reconstructed by using filtered back projection (FPB), adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR), and a model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR). Radiologists used a semiquantitative scale (-3 to +3) to rate subjective image quality and artifacts, comparing both FBP and MBIR images with ASIR images. The Wilcoxon test and the intraclass correlation coefficient were used to evaluate the data. Measurements of objective noise and CT numbers of soft tissue structures were compared with analysis of variance.The phantom study revealed an improved detectability of low-contrast targets for MBIR compared with ASIR or FBP. Subjective ratings showed higher image quality for MBIR, with better resolution (median value, 2; range, 1 to 3), lower noise (2; range, 1 to 3), and finer contours (2; range, 1 to 2) compared with ASIR (all P < .001). FBP performed inferiorly (0, range, -2 to 0]; -1 [range, -3 to 0]; 0 [range, -1 to 0], respectively; all, P < .001). Mean interobserver correlation was 0.9 for image perception and 0.7 for artifacts. Objective noise for FBP was 14%-68% higher and for MBIR was 18%-47% lower than that for ASIR (P < .001).The MBIR algorithm considerably improved objective and subjective image quality parameters of routine abdominal multidetector CT images compared with those of ASIR and FBP.",
        "Purpose To study chest computed tomography (CT) in tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant adenocarcinoma. Materials and Methods This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board. Informed consent was waived. One hundred thirty consecutive patients with stage IV adenocarcinoma and EGFR mutations at a single tertiary center from November 2004 to April 2010 were enrolled retrospectively. CT images were analyzed with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor guidelines. Target lesions were classified by size, type, axial location, and metastasis. Patients were followed after TKI therapy, and treatment response was classified as partial response, stable disease, or progressive disease. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to correlate baseline CT features and EGFR mutations with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival. Results All patients underwent TKI therapy after identifying exon mutations in the EGFR gene, comprising exon 19 deletion (19del) (n = 77), L858R (n = 43), and exon 18 (n = 10). Outcomes were partial response (n = 103), stable disease (n = 22), and progressive disease (n = 5). In univariate analysis, PFS was significantly longer with small lesions (hazard ratio [HR], 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01, 1.03; P < .01), nodular main lesions (HR, 0.55; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.88; P = .01), or peripheral lesions (HR, 0.62; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.93; P = .02). In univariate analysis, PFS was significantly longer with smaller lesions (HR, 1.02; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.03; P < .01), nodular main lesions (HR, 0.55; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.88; P = .01), peripheral lesions (HR, 0.62; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.93; P = .02), 19del (HR, 0.33; 95% CI: 0.14, 0.77; P = .01), or L858R (HR, 0.39; 95% CI: 0.16, 0.97; P = .04). In multivariate analysis, PFS was significantly longer with 19del (HR, 0.30; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.84; P = .02) and shorter with scattered metastases (HR, 2.25; 95% CI: 1.44, 5.51; P < .01).

        "Purpose To measure the levels of gadolinium present in the rat brain 1 and 20 weeks after dosing with contrast agent and to determine if there are any histopathologic sequelae. Materials and Methods The study was approved by the GE Global Research Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Absolute gadolinium levels were quantified in the blood and brains of rats 1 week after dosing and 20 weeks after dosing with up to 20 repeat doses of gadodiamide (cumulative dose, 12 mmol per kilogram of body weight) by using inductively coupled plasma\u2013mass spectrometry. Treatment groups (n = 6 rats per group) included low-dosage and high-dosage gadodiamide and osmolality-matched saline controls. Brain sections were submitted (blinded) for standard toxicology assessment per Registry of Industrial Toxicology Animal data guidelines. Analysis of variance and Mann-Whitney U tests with post hoc correction were used to assess differences in absolute gadolinium levels and percentage of injected dose, respectively. Results Dose-dependent low levels of gadolinium were detected in the brain, a mean \u00b1 standard deviation of 2.49 nmol per gram of brain tissue \u00b1 0.30 or 0.00019% of the injected dose 1 week after dosing. This diminished by approximately 50% (to 1.38 nmol per gram of brain tissue \u00b1 0.10 or 0.00011% of the injected dose) 20 weeks after dosing. As a percentage of injected dose, the levels of gadolinium measured were comparable between different doses, indicating that mechanisms of uptake and elimination were not saturated at the tested doses. There were no histopathologic findings associated with the levels of gadolinium measured. Conclusion Low levels of gadolinium are present in the brain after repeat dosing with gadodiamide, which is partially cleared over 20 weeks with no detectable neurotoxicity.",
        "To assess feasibility and reliability of electrocardiographic (ECG)-gated cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with a simplified reusable electrode design that does not touch the skin.In this institutional review board-approved, HIPAA-compliant study, a silicon positioner held four ECG leads and detected ECG signals without requiring shaving, adhesive, or removal of the gown. The patient lies down on the device and the patient's weight ensures good lead contact against patient's gown; electrode gel that soaks through the gown provides electrical contact with the skin. It was tested at 1.5 T on 12 volunteers and 52 patients by using double inversion recovery, steady-state, fast gradient-echo time course perfusion, and delayed inversion recovery sequences. Paired Student t test was used to assess the significance of differences in durations to apply and remove ECG pad and standard leads. Image quality was assessed and rated on a four-point scale by two readers. The ECG signal quality obtained from pad and leads was rated on a five-point scale. Ventricular septal sharpness and signal-to-noise ratio were measured on images generated by ECG gating from pads and standard leads.Application and removal duration was 444 seconds with standard leads compared with 296 seconds with the ECG pad, and mean difference in setup time was 148 seconds (P = .005). Ventricular septal sharpness (1/slope) was 165 for ECG pad and 152 for standard leads (P = .3). Septal signal-to-noise ratio on images generated by cardiac gating with ECG pad was 38 \u00b1 12 (standard deviation) compared with 39 \u00b1 14 for standard leads (P = .7). The qualitative image quality score for ECG pad (3.9 \u00b1 0.19) was comparable to ECG leads (3.8 \u00b1 0.45; P = .47). The mean ECG signal qualitative scores were also comparable (pad vs leads, 4.9 \u00b1 0.43 vs 4.9 \u00b1 0.14, respectively; P = .9). Volunteers preferred the ECG pad and reported that it was comfortable and convenient. ECG pad was successful in 50 of 52 (96%) patients. Two patients, including one with large pleural effusions and another with ventricular tachycardia, were not successfully gated.This simplified approach to ECG gating is faster to set up and more convenient and comfortable for patients.",

Materials and Methods In this secondary analysis of a prospective trial, unenhanced 3-T knee MRI scans obtained in youth competitive alpine skiers were compared with images in control participants of the same age from 2014 to 2019 (Cantonal Ethics Committee Zurich registry number: KEK-ZH-2017-01395) for presence of DFCIs at the femoral attachment of the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle (MHG) and/or lateral head of the gastrocnemius muscle (LHG) and adductor magnus tendon by two radiologists. DFCI size and tendon attachment position were measured. Tendon attachment position and associated MRI findings (meniscus, cartilage, bone marrow edema, joint effusion, ligaments, tendons) were examined for an association with DFCI. Pearson \u03c72, Student t test, logistic regression, and \u03ba statistics were applied. Results Unilateral knee MRI scans obtained in 105 skiers (mean age, 14.8 years \u00b1 0.6 [standard deviation]; 66 boys) and in 105 control participants (mean age, 14.6 years \u00b1 0.5; 59 boys) were evaluated. DFCIs were found in 61 of 105 skiers (58%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 48.5%, 67.2%) compared with 28 of 105 control participants (27%; 95% CI: 18.9%, 35.7%) (P < .001). Two skiers had more than one DFCI. Distribution of DFCIs for skiers and control participants was 60 of 63 (95.2%) and 26 of 28 (92.8%) at the MHG, three of 63 (4.8%) and one of 28 (3.6%) at the LHG, and zero of 63 (0%) and one of 28 (3.6%) at the adductor magnus attachment site, respectively. Interreader agreement was almost perfect (\u03ba = 0.87; 95% CI: 0.80, 0.93). The mean size of MHG-related DFCIs in skiers (3.7 mm) was not different compared to the size of those in control participants (3.4 mm) (P = .32), nor was a difference found for the MHG tendon attachment position in knees with DFCI (63.9 mm vs 63.0 mm, P = .83) or without DFCI (63.6 mm vs 62.8 mm, P = .86). Regarding associated MRI findings, increased signal intensity of the MHG tendon showed a significant association with MHG-related DFCI in both groups (P = .01 for both). Conclusion A distal femoral cortical irregularity at the attachment sites of tendons was a frequent incidental finding on knee MRI scans, with an increased prevalence in youth competitive alpine skiers. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To assess the ability of noninvasive vascular elastography (NIVE) to help characterize endoleaks and thrombus organization in a canine model of abdominal aortic aneurysm after endovascular aneurysm repair with stent-grafts, in comparison with computed tomography (CT) and pathologic examination findings. Materials and Methods All protocols were approved by the Animal Care Committee in accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council of Animal Care. Stent-grafts were implanted in a group of 18 dogs with aneurysms created in the abdominal aorta. Type I endoleak was created in four aneurysms; type II endoleak, in 13 aneurysms; and no endoleak, in one aneurysm. Doppler ultrasonography and NIVE examinations were performed at baseline and at 1-week, 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up. Angiography, CT, and macroscopic tissue examination were performed at sacrifice. Strain values were computed by using the Lagrangian speckle model estimator. Areas of endoleak, solid organized thrombus, and fresh thrombus were identified and segmented by comparing the results of CT and macroscopic tissue examination. Strain values were compared by using the Wilcoxon rank-sum and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results All stent-grafts were successfully deployed, and endoleaks were clearly depicted in the last follow-up elastography examinations. Maximal axial strains over consecutive heart cycles in endoleak, organized thrombus, and fresh thrombus areas were 0.78% \u00b1 0.22, 0.23% \u00b1 0.02, 0.10% \u00b1 0.04, respectively. Strain values were significantly different between endoleak and organized or fresh thrombus areas (P < .000) and between organized and fresh thrombus areas (P < .0002). No correlation was found between strain values and type of endoleak, sac pressure, endoleak size, and aneurysm size. Conclusion NIVE may be able to help characterize endoleak and thrombus organization, regardless of the size, pressure, and type of endoleak. \u00a9 RSNA, 2015",
        "To explore the neural correlates of the thalamus by using resting-state functional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and to investigate whether thalamic resting-state networks (RSNs) are disrupted in patients with mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI).This HIPAA-compliant study was approved by the institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained from 24 patients with MTBI and 17 healthy control subjects. The patients had varying degrees of symptoms, with a mean disease duration of 22 days. The resting-state functional MR imaging data were analyzed by using a standard seed-based whole-brain correlation method to characterize thalamic RSNs. Student t tests were used to perform comparisons. The association between thalamic RSNs and performance on neuropsychologic and neurobehavioral measures was also investigated in patients with MTBI by using Spearman rank correlation.A normal pattern of thalamic RSNs was demonstrated in healthy subjects. This pattern was characterized as representing relatively symmetric and restrictive functional thalamocortical connectivity, suggesting an inhibitory property of the thalamic neurons during the resting state. This pattern was disrupted, with significantly increased thalamic RSNs (P \u2264 .005) and decreased symmetry (P = .03) in patients with MTBI compared with healthy control subjects. Increased functional thalamocortical redistributive connectivity was correlated with diminished neurocognitive functions and clinical symptoms in patients with MTBI.These findings of abnormal thalamic RSNs lend further support to the presumed subtle thalamic injury in patients with MTBI. Resting-state functional MR imaging can be used as an additional imaging modality for detection of thalamocortical connectivity abnormalities and for better understanding of the complex persistent postconcussive syndrome.",
        "To prospectively compare the reproducibility of normal liver apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements by using different respiratory motion compensation techniques with multiple breath-hold (MBH), free-breathing (FB), respiratory-triggered (RT), and navigator-triggered (NT) diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging and to compare the ADCs at different liver anatomic locations.The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained from each participant. Thirty-nine volunteers underwent liver DW imaging twice. Imaging was performed with a 1.5-T MR imager with MBH, FB, RT, and NT techniques (b = 0, 100, and 500 sec/mm(2)). Three representative sections--superior, central, and inferior--were selected on left and right liver lobes, respectively. On each selected section, three regions of interest were drawn, and ADCs were measured. Analysis of variance was used to assess ADCs among the four techniques and various anatomic locations. Reproducibility of ADCs was assessed with the Bland-Altman method.ADCs obtained with MBH (range: right lobe, [1.641-1.662] \u00d7 10(-3)mm(2)/sec; left lobe, [2.034-2.054] \u00d710(-3)mm(2)/sec) were higher than those obtained with FB (right, [1.349-1.391] \u00d710(-3)mm(2)/sec; left, [1.630-1.700] \u00d710(-3)mm(2)/sec), RT (right, [1.439-1.455] \u00d710(-3)mm(2)/sec; left, [1.720-1.755] \u00d710(-3)mm(2)/sec), or NT (right, [1.387-1.400] \u00d710(-3)mm(2)/sec; left, [1.661-1.736] \u00d710(-3)mm(2)/sec) techniques (P < .001); however, no significant difference was observed between ADCs obtained with FB, RT, and NT techniques (P = .130 to P >.99). ADCs showed a trend to decrease moving from left to right. Reproducibility in the left liver lobe was inferior to that in the right, and the central middle segment in the right lobe had the most reproducible ADC. Statistical differences in ADCs were observed in the left-right direction in the right lobe (P < .001), but they were not observed in the superior-inferior direction (P = .144-.450). However, in the left liver lobe, statistical differences existed in both directions (P = .001 to P = .016 in the left-right direction, P < .001 in the superior-inferior direction).Both anatomic location and DW imaging technique influence liver ADC measurements and their reproducibility. FB DW imaging is recommended for liver DW imaging because of its good reproducibility and shorter acquisition time compared with that of MBH, RT, and NT techniques.",
        "Purpose To determine if high lung shunt fraction (LSF) is an independent prognostic indicator of poor survival in patients who undergo yttrium 90 radioembolization for unresectable liver-dominant metastatic colorectal cancer. Materials and Methods Retrospective data were analyzed from 606 patients (62% men; mean age, 62 years) who underwent radioembolization to treat liver metastases from colorectal adenocarcinoma between July 2002 and December 2011 at 11 U.S. centers. Institutional review board exemptions were granted prior to the collection of data at each site. Overall survival was estimated by using Kaplan-Meier survival and univariate Cox proportional hazards models to examine the effect of LSF on survival and to compare this to other potential prognostic indicators. Multivariate analysis was also performed to determine whether LSF is an independent risk factor for poor survival. Results LSF higher than 10% was predictive of significantly decreased survival (median, 6.9 months vs 10.0 months; hazard ratio, 1.60; P < .001) and demonstrated a mild but significant correlation to serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels and tumor-to-liver volume ratio (Pearson correlation coefficients, 0.105 and 0.113, respectively; P < .05). A progressive decrease in survival was observed as LSF increased from less than 5% to more than 20% (P < .05). LSF did not correlate with the presence of extrahepatic metastases or prior administration of bevacizumab. Conclusion Increased LSF is an independent prognostic indicator of worse survival in patients undergoing radioembolization for liver-dominant metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma. High LSF correlates poorly to other potential markers of tumor size, such as tumor-to-liver volume ratio or serum carcinoembryonic antigen level, and does not correlate to the presence of extrahepatic metastases. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To determine the diagnostic accuracy for clinically significant prostate cancer achieved with abbreviated biparametric prostate magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in comparison with full multiparametric contrast material\u2013enhanced prostate MR imaging in men with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and negative transrectal ultrasonography (US)\u2013guided biopsy findings; to determine the significant cancer detection rate of biparametric versus full multiparametric contrast-enhanced MR imaging and between-reader agreement for interpretation of biparametric MR imaging. Materials and Methods In this institutional review board\u2013approved retrospective review of prospectively acquired data, men with PSA greater than or equal to 3 ng/mL after negative transrectal US-guided biopsy findings underwent state-of-the-art, full multiparametric contrast-enhanced MR imaging at 3.0-T including high-spatial-resolution structural imaging in several planes, diffusion-weighted imaging at 0, 800, 1000, and 1400 mm2/sec, and dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging, obtained without endorectal coil within 34 minutes 19 seconds. One of four radiologists with different levels of expertise (1\u20139 years) first reviewed only a fraction of the full multiparametric contrast-enhanced MR images, consisting of single-plane (axial) structural imaging (T2-weighted turbo spin-echo and diffusion-weighted imaging), acquired within 8 minutes 45 seconds (referred to as biparametric MR imaging), and established a diagnosis according to the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 2; only thereafter, the remaining full multiparametric contrast-enhanced MR images were read. Men with PI-RADS categories 3\u20135 underwent MR-guided targeted biopsy. Men with PI-RADS categories 1\u20132 remained in urologic follow-up for at least 2 years, with rebiopsy (transrectal US-guided or transperineal saturation) where appropriate. McNemar test was used to compare diagnostic accuracies. To investigate between-reader agreement, biparametric MR images of 100 patients were read independently by all three radiologists. Results A total of 542 men, aged 64.8 years \u00b1 8.2 (median PSA, 7 ng/mL), were included. Biparametric MR imaging helped detect clinically significant prostate cancer in 138 men. Full multiparametric contrast-enhanced MR imaging allowed detection of one additional clinically significant prostate cancer (a stage pT2a, intermediate-risk cancer with a Gleason score of 3+4) and caused 11 additional false-positive diagnoses. Diagnostic accuracy for detection of clinically significant cancer of biparametric MR imaging (89.1%, 483 of 542) was similar to that of full multiparametric contrast-enhanced MR imaging (87.2%, 473 of 542). Between-reader agreement of biparametric MR imaging interpretation was substantial (\u03ba = 0.81). Conclusion Biparametric MR imaging allows detection of clinically significant prostate cancer missed by transrectal US-guided biopsy. Biparametric prostate MR imaging takes less than 9 minutes examination time, works without contrast agent injection, and offers a diagnostic accuracy and cancer detection rate that are equivalent to those of conventional full multiparametric contrast-enhanced MR imaging protocols. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017",
        "To retrospectively evaluate the diagnostic performance of multiparametric endorectal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, including T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted (DW), and dynamic contrast material-enhanced (DCE) MR techniques, for the diagnosis of seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) and to determine the incremental value of DW MR and DCE MR images.This retrospective HIPAA-compliant study was approved by the institutional review board, with a waiver of informed consent. The study included 131 patients (mean age, 68 years; range, 43-75 years) who underwent endorectal MR imaging before radical prostatectomy between January 2007 and April 2010. Two radiologists (A: experienced, B: less experienced) estimated the likelihood of SVI by using a five-point ordinal scale in three image-viewing settings: T2-weighted images alone; T2-weighted and DW MR images; and T2-weighted, DW MR, and DCE MR images. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated. Confidence intervals estimated with bootstrapping and the McNemar test or Fisher exact test were used to compare sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value.Of the 131 patients, 23 (17.6%) had SVI identified after surgery. Review of T2-weighted MR images alone resulted in high specificity (93.1% and 93.6%, for radiologists A and B, respectively) and high negative predictive value (94.8% and 94.0%) but moderate sensitivity (59% and 52%) and positive predictive value (52% and 50%). Review of T2-weighted and DW MR images significantly improved specificity (96.6% [P = .02] and 98.3% [P = .003]) and positive predictive value (70% [P < .05] and 79% [P < .05]) without significantly improving AUC. Additional review of DCE MR images did not yield further incremental improvement.Additional review of DW MR images improves specificity and positive predictive value in SVI detection compared with reviewing T2-weighted images alone. Addition of DCE MR images to this combination, however, does not provide incremental value for diagnosis of SVI.",

        "Background Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the recommended treatment for intermediate hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer guidelines. Prospective uncontrolled studies suggest that yttrium 90 (90Y) transarterial radioembolization (TARE) is a safe and effective alternative. Purpose To compare the efficacy and safety of TARE with TACE for unresectable HCC. Materials and Methods In this single-center prospective randomized controlled trial (TRACE), 90Y glass TARE was compared with doxorubicin drug-eluting bead (DEB) TACE in participants with intermediate-stage HCC, extended to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 1 and those with early-stage HCC not eligible for surgery or thermoablation. Participants were recruited between September 2011 and March 2018. The primary end point was time to overall tumor progression (TTP) (Kaplan-Meier analysis) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) groups. Results At interim analysis, 38 participants (median age, 67 years; IQR, 63-72 years; 33 men) were randomized to the TARE arm and 34 (median age, 68 years; IQR, 61-71 years; 30 men) to the DEB-TACE arm (ITT group). Median TTP was 17.1 months in the TARE arm versus 9.5 months in the DEB-TACE arm (ITT group hazard ratio [HR], 0.36; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.70; P = .002) (PP group, 32 and 34 participants, respectively, in each arm; HR, 0.29; 95% CI: 0.14, 0.60; P < .001). Median overall survival was 30.2 months after TARE and 15.6 months after DEB-TACE (ITT group HR, 0.48; 95% CI: 0.28, 0.82; P = .006). Serious adverse events grade 3 or higher (13 of 33 participants [39%] vs 19 of 36 [53%] after TARE and DEB-TACE, respectively; P = .47) and 30-day mortality (0 of 33 participants [0%] vs three of 36 [8.3%]; P = .24) were similar in the safety groups. At the interim, the HR for the primary end point, TTP, was less than 0.39, meeting the criteria to halt the study. Conclusion With similar safety profile, yttrium 90 radioembolization conferred superior tumor control and survival compared with chemoembolization using drug-eluting beads in selected participants with early or intermediate hepatocellular carcinoma.

        "Background Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 2.0 requires multiparametric MRI of the prostate, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging sequences; however, the contribution of DCE imaging remains unclear. Purpose To assess whether DCE imaging in addition to apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and normalized T2 values improves PI-RADS version 2.0 for prediction of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, clinically reported PI-RADS lesions in consecutive men who underwent 3-T multiparametric MRI (T2-weighted, DWI, and DCE MRI) from May 2015 to September 2016 were analyzed quantitatively and compared with systematic and targeted MRI-transrectal US fusion biopsy. The normalized T2 signal (nT2), ADC measurement, mean early-phase DCE signal (mDCE), and heuristic DCE parameters were calculated. Logistic regression analysis indicated the most predictive DCE parameters for csPCa (Gleason grade group \u22652). Receiver operating characteristic parameter models were compared using the Obuchowski test. Recursive partitioning analysis determined ADC and mDCE value ranges for combined use with PI-RADS. Results Overall, 260 men (median age, 64 years [IQR, 58-69 years]) with 432 lesions (csPCa [n = 152] and no csPCa [n = 280]) were included. The mDCE parameter was predictive of csPCa when accounting for the ADC and nT2 parameter in the peripheral zone (odds ratio [OR], 1.76; 95% CI: 1.30, 2.44; P = .001) but not the transition zone (OR, 1.17; 95% CI: 0.81, 1.69; P = .41). Recursive partitioning analysis selected an ADC cutoff of 0.897 \u00d7 10-3 mm2/sec (P = .04) as a classifier for peripheral zone lesions with a PI-RADS score assessed on the ADC map (hereafter, ADC PI-RADS) of 3. The mDCE parameter did not differentiate ADC PI-RADS 3 lesions (P = .11), but classified lesions with ADC PI-RADS scores greater than 3 with low ADC values (less than 0.903 \u00d7 10-3 mm2/sec, P < .001) into groups with csPCa rates of 70% and 97% (P = .008). A lesion size cutoff of 1.5 cm and qualitative DCE parameters were not defined as classifiers according to recursive partitioning (P > .05). Conclusion Quantitative or qualitative dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI was not relevant for Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) 3 lesion risk stratification, while quantitative apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were helpful in upgrading PI-RADS 3 and PI-RADS 4 lesions. Quantitative ADC measurement may be more important for risk stratification than current methods in future versions of PI-RADS. \u00a9 RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article See also the editorial by Goh in this issue.",

        "Purpose To evaluate the effect of middle meningeal artery (MMA) embolization on chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) and compare the treatment outcomes of MMA embolization and conventional treatment. Materials and Methods All consecutive patients 20 years or older with CSDH were assessed for eligibility. CSDHs with a focal location, a thickness of 10 mm or less, no mass effect, or underlying conditions were excluded. Seventy-two prospectively enrolled patients with CSDH underwent MMA embolization (embolization group; as the sole treatment in 27 [37.5%] asymptomatic patients and with additional hematoma removal for symptom relief in 45 [62.5%] symptomatic patients). For comparison, 469 patients who underwent conventional treatment were included as a historical control group (conventional treatment group; close, nonsurgical follow-up in 67 [14.3%] and hematoma removal in 402 [85.7%] patients). Primary outcome was treatment failure defined as a composite of incomplete hematoma resolution (remaining or reaccumulated hematoma with thickness > 10 mm) or surgical rescue (hematoma removal for relief of symptoms that developed with continuous growth of initial or reaccumulated hematoma). Secondary outcomes included surgical rescue as a component of the primary outcome and treatment-related complication for safety measure. Six-month outcomes were compared between the study groups with logistic regression analysis. Results Spontaneous hematoma resolution was achieved in all of 27 asymptomatic patients undergoing embolization without direct hematoma removal. Hematoma reaccumulation occurred in one (2.2%) of 45 symptomatic patients receiving embolization with additional hematoma removal. Treatment failure rate in the embolization group was lower than in the conventional treatment group (one of 72 patients [1.4%] vs 129 of 469 patients [27.5%], respectively; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.056; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.011, 0.286; P = .001). Surgical rescue was less frequent in the embolization group (one of 72 patients [1.4%] vs 88 of 469 patients [18.8%]; adjusted OR, 0.094; 95% CI: 0.018, 0.488; P = .005). Treatment-related complication rate was not different between the two groups (0 of 72 patients vs 20 of 469 patients [4.3%]; adjusted OR, 0.145; 95% CI: 0.009, 2.469; P = .182). Conclusion MMA embolization has a positive therapeutic effect on CSDH and is more effective than conventional treatment. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017",
        "To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for hepatic nodules 20 mm or smaller detected during ultrasonographic (US) surveillance in patients with cirrhosis.Between November 2003 and January 2010, patients with cirrhosis with a newly US-detected solitary hepatic nodule 20 mm or smaller were included in this institutional ethics committee-approved study. All patients provided written informed consent before the study; the need to obtain consent for reanalysis of the data was waived. Patients underwent MR imaging and fine-needle biopsy (the reference standard). Nodules without pathologic confirmation were followed up with MR imaging every 6 months. A LI-RADS category was retrospectively assigned to nodules seen at MR imaging. The diagnostic accuracy for each LI-RADS category was described by sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values with 95% confidence intervals.Final diagnoses of 133 nodules in 159 patients were as follows: 102 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), three intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (ICCs), one neuroendocrine metastasis, and 27 benign lesions (median MR imaging follow-up, 95 months). None (0%) of five LI-RADS category 1 lesions, three (25%) of 12 category 2 lesions, 29 (69%) of 42 category 3 lesions, 24 (96%) of 25 category 4 lesions, and 44 (98%) of 45 category 5 lesions were HCCs. One category 3 lesion was ICC, one category 5 lesion was a neuroendocrine metastasis, and two (50%) of four lesions categorized as other malignancies were HCCs. In patients with nodules detected at surveillance US, LI-RADS category 4 criteria were as effective as category 5 criteria for HCC diagnosis. Combining both categories would improve sensitivity without impairing specificity or positive or negative predictive value for HCC diagnosis (42.3%, 98.2%, 97.8%, and 47.4% vs 65.4%, 96.4%, 97.1%, and 59.6%, respectively).In patients with cirrhosis with US-detected nodules 20 mm or smaller, both LI-RADS category 4 and category 5 have high specificity for HCC. In addition, a relevant proportion of lesions categorized as LI-RADS category 2 or 3 or as other malignancies were HCCs. Thus, active diagnostic work-up, including biopsy to allow prompt treatment, is recommended in such patients. Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To optimize intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging by estimating the effects of diffusion gradient polarity and breathing acquisition scheme on image quality, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), IVIM parameters, and parameter reproducibility, as well as to investigate the potential of IVIM in the detection of hepatic fibrosis.In this institutional review board-approved prospective study, 20 subjects (seven healthy volunteers, 13 patients with hepatitis C virus infection; 14 men, six women; mean age, 46 years) underwent IVIM DW imaging with four sequences: (a) respiratory-triggered (RT) bipolar (BP) sequence, (b) RT monopolar (MP) sequence, (c) free-breathing (FB) BP sequence, and (d) FB MP sequence. Image quality scores were assessed for all sequences. A biexponential analysis with the Bayesian method yielded true diffusion coefficient (D), pseudodiffusion coefficient (D*), and perfusion fraction (PF) in liver parenchyma. Mixed-model analysis of variance was used to compare image quality, SNR, IVIM parameters, and interexamination variability between the four sequences, as well as the ability to differentiate areas of liver fibrosis from normal liver tissue.Image quality with RT sequences was superior to that with FB acquisitions (P = .02) and was not affected by gradient polarity. SNR did not vary significantly between sequences. IVIM parameter reproducibility was moderate to excellent for PF and D, while it was less reproducible for D*. PF and D were both significantly lower in patients with hepatitis C virus than in healthy volunteers with the RT BP sequence (PF = 13.5% \u00b1 5.3 [standard deviation] vs 9.2% \u00b1 2.5, P = .038; D = [1.16 \u00b1 0.07] \u00d7 10(-3) mm(2)/sec vs [1.03 \u00b1 0.1] \u00d7 10(-3) mm(2)/sec, P = .006).The RT BP DW imaging sequence had the best results in terms of image quality, reproducibility, and ability to discriminate between healthy and fibrotic liver with biexponential fitting.",
        "Background The lack of functional information in thoracic CT remains a limitation of its use in the clinical management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Purpose To compare the distribution of pulmonary ventilation assessed by a CT-based full-scale airway network (FAN) flow model with hyperpolarized xenon 129 (129Xe) MRI (hereafter, 129Xe MRI) and technetium 99m\u2013diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid aerosol SPECT ventilation imaging (hereafter, V-SPECT) in participants with COPD. Materials and Methods In this prospective study performed between May and August 2017, pulmonary ventilation in participants with COPD was computed by using the FAN flow model. The modeled pulmonary ventilation was compared with functional imaging data from breath-hold time-series 129Xe MRI and V-SPECT. FAN-derived ventilation images on the coronal plane and volumes of interest were compared with functional lung images. Percentage lobar ventilation estimated by the FAN model was compared with that measured at 129Xe MRI and V-SPECT. The statistical significance of ventilation distribution between FAN and functional images was demonstrated with the Spearman correlation coefficient and \u03c72 distance. Results For this study, nine participants (seven men [mean age, 65 years \u00b1 5 {standard deviation}] and two women [mean age, 63 years \u00b1 7]) with COPD that was Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease stage II\u2013IV were enrolled. FAN-modeled ventilation profile showed strong positive correlation with images from 129Xe MRI (\u03c1 = 0.67; P < .001) and V-SPECT (\u03c1 = 0.65; P < .001). The \u03c72 distances of the ventilation histograms in the volumes of interest between the FAN and 129Xe MRI and FAN and V-SPECT were 0.16 \u00b1 0.08 and 0.28 \u00b1 0.14, respectively. The ratios of lobar ventilations in the models were linearly correlated to images from 129Xe MRI (\u03c1 = 0.67; P < .001) and V-SPECT (\u03c1 = 0.59; P < .001). Conclusion A CT-based full-scale airway network flow model provided regional pulmonary ventilation information for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and correlates with hyperpolarized xenon 129 MRI and technetium 99m\u2013diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid aerosol SPECT ventilation imaging. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Purpose To investigate the long-term course of MRI signal intensity (SI) changes and the presence of gadolinium in the rat brain during a 1-year period after multiple administrations of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs). Materials and Methods Rats received a linear GBCA (gadodiamide, gadopentetate dimeglumine, gadobenate dimeglumine), a macrocyclic GBCA (gadobutrol, gadoterate meglumine, gadoteridol), or saline. Animals received eight injections over 2 weeks (1.8 mmol/kg per injection). Brain MRI and gadolinium measurements were performed with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and laser ablation ICP-MS 5, 26, and 52 weeks after administration. Results Animals that received linear GBCAs showed higher deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN)-to-brainstem SI ratios compared with the saline group (P < .001 at all time points). After 1 year, mean gadolinium concentrations in the cerebellum were 3.38 nmol/g (gadodiamide), 2.13 nmol/g (gadopentetate dimeglumine), and 1.91 nmol/g (gadobenate dimeglumine). For linear agents, laser ablation ICP-MS revealed gadolinium depositions in the cerebellar nuclei. For macrocyclic GBCAs, the DCN-to-brainstem SI ratios did not significantly differ from those in the saline group (P > .42) and the cerebellar gadolinium concentrations decreased between weeks 5 and 52, reaching 0.08 nmol/g (gadobutrol), 0.04 nmol/g (gadoterate meglumine), and 0.07 nmol/g (gadoteridol). The respective laser ablation ICP-MS analysis showed no gadolinium depositions. Conclusion Increased signal intensity in the deep cerebellar nuclei of rats persists for at least 1 year after administration of linear gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs), in line with persistent brain gadolinium concentrations with no elimination after the initial 5-week period. The animals that received macrocyclic GBCAs showed an ongoing elimination of gadolinium from the brain during the entire observation period. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018.",
        "To evaluate the influence of cross-sectional arc calcification on the diagnostic accuracy of computed tomography (CT) angiography compared with conventional coronary angiography for the detection of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD).Institutional Review Board approval and written informed consent were obtained from all centers and participants for this HIPAA-compliant study. Overall, 4511 segments from 371 symptomatic patients (279 men, 92 women; median age, 61 years [interquartile range, 53-67 years]) with clinical suspicion of CAD from the CORE-64 multicenter study were included in the analysis. Two independent blinded observers evaluated the percentage of diameter stenosis and the circumferential extent of calcium (arc calcium). The accuracy of quantitative multidetector CT angiography to depict substantial (\u2265 50%) stenoses was assessed by using quantitative coronary angiography (QCA). Cross-sectional arc calcium was rated on a segment level as follows: noncalcified or mild (< 90\u00b0), moderate (90\u00b0-180\u00b0), or severe (> 180\u00b0) calcification. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression, receiver operation characteristic curve, and clustering methods were used for statistical analyses.A total of 1099 segments had mild calcification, 503 had moderate calcification, 338 had severe calcification, and 2571 segments were noncalcified. Calcified segments were highly associated (P < .001) with disagreement between CTA and QCA in multivariable analysis after controlling for sex, age, heart rate, and image quality. The prevalence of CAD was 5.4% in noncalcified segments, 15.0% in mildly calcified segments, 27.0% in moderately calcified segments, and 43.0% in severely calcified segments. A significant difference was found in area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (noncalcified: 0.86, mildly calcified: 0.85, moderately calcified: 0.82, severely calcified: 0.81; P < .05).In a symptomatic patient population, segment-based coronary artery calcification significantly decreased agreement between multidetector CT angiography and QCA to detect a coronary stenosis of at least 50%.",
        "Purpose To determine the effect of intravenous (IV) low-osmolality iodinated contrast material (LOCM) on the development of post\u2013computed tomography (CT) acute kidney injury (AKI), stratified by pre-CT estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), in patients with stable renal function. Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval was obtained and patient consent waived for this HIPAA-compliant, retrospective study. CT examinations performed over a 10-year period on unique adult inpatients with sufficient serum creatinine (SCr) data and stable renal function (difference between baseline and pre-CT SCr within 0.3 mg/dL and 50% of baseline) were identified. A 1:1 propensity score matched cohort analysis with multivariate analysis of effects was performed with post-CT AKI as the primary outcome measure (8826 nonenhanced and 8826 IV contrast agent\u2013enhanced CT studies in 17 652 patients). Propensity matching was performed with respect to likelihood of receiving IV contrast material (19 tested covariates). Post-CT AKI with Acute Kidney Injury Network SCr criteria was the primary endpoint. A stepwise multivariate conditional logistic regression model was performed to identify the effect of IV LOCM on post-CT AKI. Results After 1:1 propensity matching, IV LOCM had a significant effect on the development of post-CT AKI (P = .04). This risk increased with decreases in pre-CT eGFR (\u226560 mL/min/1.73 m2: odds ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval: 0.86, 1.16; 45\u201359 mL/min/1.73 m2: odds ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval: 0.82, 1.38; 30\u201344 mL/min/1.73 m2: odds ratio, 1.40; 95% confidence interval: 1.00, 1.97; <30 mL/min/1.73 m2: odds ratio, 2.96; 95% confidence interval: 1.22, 7.17). Conclusion IV LOCM is a nephrotoxic risk factor in patients with a stable eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, with a trend toward significance at 30\u201344 mL/min/1.73 m2. IV LOCM does not appear to be a nephrotoxic risk factor in patients with a pre-CT eGFR of 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 or greater. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "History Part one of this case appeared 4 months previously and may contain larger images. A 32-year-old woman presented to an ophthalmologist for bilateral blurry vision. She underwent MRI of the brain and orbits, which showed a focal abnormality within the pituitary gland. The patient was referred to an endocrinologist for further evaluation. Review of systems and physical examination by the endocrinologist revealed no symptoms or signs of endocrine dysfunction. Anterior pituitary hormone levels, including growth hormone, prolactin, thyroid stimulating hormone, follicular-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and adrenocorticotropic hormone, were normal. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI of the sella and pituitary gland and subsequent CT of the anterior skull base were performed.",
        "Purpose To investigate diagnostic performance by using a deep learning method with a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the differentiation of liver masses at dynamic contrast agent-enhanced computed tomography (CT). Materials and Methods This clinical retrospective study used CT image sets of liver masses over three phases (noncontrast-agent enhanced, arterial, and delayed). Masses were diagnosed according to five categories (category A, classic hepatocellular carcinomas [HCCs]; category B, malignant liver tumors other than classic and early HCCs; category C, indeterminate masses or mass-like lesions [including early HCCs and dysplastic nodules] and rare benign liver masses other than hemangiomas and cysts; category D, hemangiomas; and category E, cysts). Supervised training was performed by using 55 536 image sets obtained in 2013 (from 460 patients, 1068 sets were obtained and they were augmented by a factor of 52 [rotated, parallel-shifted, strongly enlarged, and noise-added images were generated from the original images]). The CNN was composed of six convolutional, three maximum pooling, and three fully connected layers. The CNN was tested with 100 liver mass image sets obtained in 2016 (74 men and 26 women; mean age, 66.4 years \u00b1 10.6 [standard deviation]; mean mass size, 26.9 mm \u00b1 25.9; 21, nine, 35, 20, and 15 liver masses for categories A, B, C, D, and E, respectively). Training and testing were performed five times. Accuracy for categorizing liver masses with CNN model and the area under receiver operating characteristic curve for differentiating categories A-B versus categories C-E were calculated. Results Median accuracy of differential diagnosis of liver masses for test data were 0.84. Median area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for differentiating categories A-B from C-E was 0.92. Conclusion Deep learning with CNN showed high diagnostic performance in differentiation of liver masses at dynamic CT. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To develop a computed tomographic (CT) angiographic postprocessing protocol with two- and three-dimensional measurements for follow-up of patients who underwent endovascular aortic repair. Materials and Methods This HIPAA-compliant institutional review board-approved retrospective study included 159 patients (129 men, 30 women; mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 74.9 years \u00b1 8.2) who underwent 824 CT examinations (median of five examinations per patient; range, two to 14) with unenhanced and arterial -phase imaging performed between September 2004 and March 2015. The largest diameter on the axial plane; coronal, sagittal, and maximal diameter perpendicular to the reconstructed centerline; volume of the abdominal aortic aneurysm sac; and volume from the lowest renal artery to the aortic bifurcation and to the common iliac artery bifurcation were measured. Endoleaks on contrast material-enhanced images were considered the reference standard, and the predictive value of diameter and volume changes was analyzed. Intraclass correlation was used to compare diameters and volumes. Results All diameters and volumes showed excellent correlation (intraclass coefficient, 0.95 and 0.94, respectively). Average interobserver difference for diameters and volumes was 2%-3% and 4%-12%, respectively. Endoleaks were observed in 80 (50%) of 159 patients (59 [74%] at initial and 21 [26%] at later CT angiography). New endo-leaks were associated with increased aneurysm size measured as the largest diameter on the axial plane (P = .04) and perpendicular to the centerline (P = .01), and volume was measured from the lowest renal artery to the aortic bifurcation (P = .03) and to the common iliac artery bifurcation (P = .01). With a 5% size threshold, sensitivity and specificity for detection of endoleaks was optimal for centerline diameter (64.3% and 81.7%, respectively) and volume from the lowest renal artery to the common iliac artery bifurcation (57.1% and 63.5%). Conclusion The maximal diameter and volume of an abdominal aortic aneurysm sac can be used for temporal monitoring after endovascular aortic repair, with excellent correlation and interobserver agreement. An increase in the centerline diameter and volume from the lowest renal artery to the iliac bifurcation were the most sensitive criteria for detecting endoleaks. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To assess procedural aspects, diagnostic adequacy, and accuracy of liver biopsy across the United Kingdom.Institutional review board approval for this type of study is not required in the United Kingdom. All radiology departments with an approved leader for departmental audit registered with the Royal College of Radiologists were invited to participate in this retrospective audit. The first 50 consecutive patients who underwent image-guided or image-assisted liver biopsy in 2008 were included. Audit standards relating to procedural aspects of biopsy, sample adequacy, and accuracy were prepared with reference to published data. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios, and accuracy were calculated. Organizational and clinical variables were investigated for their association with diagnostic specimen quality.Eighty-seven (41%) of 210 departments supplied data for this study, with a total of 3496 cases (1225 focal disease, 2262 nonfocal disease, nine unspecified). Ultrasonographic (US) guidance was the technique most commonly used for focal lesions and for cases of nonfocal disease (2808 [96.38%] of 3490 cases). The audit standard for sample adequacy (98%) was narrowly missed in practice (3401 [97.96%] of 3472 cases); however, the standard for diagnostic accuracy (90%) was met (3187 [98.55%] of 3234 cases). Poor compliance with postbiopsy documentation was observed.The majority of liver biopsies in this audit were performed by radiologists using image guidance or assistance, usually in the form of US. Biopsies were performed with a high degree of accuracy. Some postprocedural aspects of biopsy failed to meet required standards and would merit reaudit after practice changes.http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.12111562/-/DC1.",
        "Purpose To evaluate the relationship between prostate cancer aggressiveness and histogram-derived apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) parameters obtained from whole-lesion assessment of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the prostate and to determine which ADC metric may help best differentiate low-grade from intermediate- or high-grade prostate cancer lesions. Materials and Methods The institutional review board approved this retrospective HIPAA-compliant study of 131 men (median age, 60 years) who underwent diffusion-weighted MR imaging before prostatectomy for prostate cancer. Clinically significant tumors (tumor volume > 0.5 mL) were identified at whole-mount step-section histopathologic examination, and Gleason scores of the tumors were recorded. A volume of interest was drawn around each significant tumor on ADC maps. The mean, median, and 10th and 25th percentile ADCs were determined from the whole-lesion histogram and correlated with the Gleason score by using the Spearman correlation coefficient (\u03c1). The ability of each parameter to help differentiate tumors with a Gleason score of 6 from those with a Gleason score of at least 7 was assessed by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (Az). Results In total, 116 clinically significant lesions (89 in the peripheral zone, 27 in the transition zone) were identified in 85 of the 131 patients (65%). Forty-six patients did not have a clinically significant lesion. For mean ADC, median ADC, 10th percentile ADC, and 25th percentile ADC, the Spearman \u03c1 values for correlation with Gleason score were \u22120.31, \u22120.30, \u22120.36, and \u22120.35, respectively, whereas the Az values for differentiating lesions with a Gleason score of 6 from those with a Gleason score of at least 7 were 0.704, 0.692, 0.758, and 0.723, respectively. The Az of 10th percentile ADC was significantly higher than that of the mean ADC for all lesions and peripheral zone lesions (P = .0001). Conclusion When whole-lesion histograms were used to derive ADC parameters, 10th percentile ADC correlated with Gleason score better than did other ADC parameters, suggesting that 10th percentile ADC may prove to be optimal for differentiating low-grade from intermediate- or high-grade prostate cancer with diffusion-weighted MR imaging. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "History A 26-year-old man presented with a 1-month history of chest pain, a palpable and painful right inguinal mass, and edema in the right lower extremity. One month earlier, he started to experience left chest pain with no cough. Pulmonary CT angiography (CTA) revealed a left lower lobe segmental pulmonary embolus. The local hospital made a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE). He received anticoagulants, and his chest pain was gradually relieved. At the time of current presentation, the patient was experiencing right lower extremity swelling and pain. Physical examination revealed a 4 \u00d7 3 cm palpable right inguinal mass with no redness. His medical history and family history were negative. The results of laboratory work-up were normal, with a D-dimer level of 0.16 mg/L fibrinogen equivalent units (reference range, <0.46 mg/L) and an international normalized ratio of 2.45 (therapeutic range, 2.0\u20133.0 for a patient taking warfarin), except the prothrombin time was 28.2 seconds (reference range, 9.6\u201312.8 seconds) and the activated partial thromboplastin time was 52.2 seconds (reference range, 24.8\u201333.8 seconds).

        "To determine whether enhancement at multiphasic multidetector computed tomography (CT) can help differentiate clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) from oncocytoma, papillary RCC, and chromophobe RCC.With institutional review board approval for this HIPAA-compliant retrospective study, the pathology database was queried to derive a cohort of 298 cases of RCC and oncocytoma with preoperative multiphasic multidetector CT with as many as four phases (unenhanced, corticomedullary, nephrographic, and excretory). A total of 170 clear cell RCCs, 57 papillary RCCs, 49 oncocytomas, and 22 chromophobe RCCs were evaluated for multiphasic enhancement and compared by using t tests. Cutoff analysis was performed to determine optimal threshold levels to discriminate among the four groups.Mean enhancement of clear cell RCCs and oncocytomas peaked in the corticomedullary phase; mean enhancement of papillary and chromophobe RCCs peaked in the nephrographic phase. Enhancement of clear cell RCCs was greater than that of oncocytomas in the corticomedullary (125 HU vs 106 HU, P = .045) and excretory (80 HU vs 67 HU, P = .034) phases. Enhancement of clear cell RCCs was greater than that of papillary RCCs in the corticomedullary (125 HU vs 54 HU, P < .001), nephrographic (103 HU vs 64 HU, P < .001), and excretory (80 HU vs 54 HU, P < .001) phases. Enhancement of clear cell RCCs was greater than that of chromophobe RCCs in the corticomedullary (125 HU vs 74 HU, P < .001) and excretory (80 HU vs 60 HU, P = .008) phases. Thresholding of enhancement helped to discriminate clear cell RCC from oncocytoma, papillary RCC, and chromophobe RCC with accuracies of 77% (83 of 108 cases), 85% (101 of 119 cases), and 84% (81 of 97 cases).Enhancement at multiphasic multidetector CT, if prospectively validated, may assist in the discrimination of clear cell RCC from oncocytoma, papillary RCC, and chromophobe RCC.",
        "To investigate associations between breast cancer molecular subtype and semiautomatically extracted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging features.Imaging and genomic data from the Cancer Genome Atlas and the Cancer Imaging Archive for 48 patients with breast cancer from four institutions in the United States were used in this institutional review board approval-exempt study. Computer vision algorithms were applied to extract 23 imaging features from lesions indicated by a breast radiologist on MR images. Morphologic, textural, and dynamic features were extracted. Molecular subtype was determined on the basis of genomic analysis. Associations between the imaging features and molecular subtype were evaluated by using logistic regression and likelihood ratio tests. The analysis controlled for the age of the patients, their menopausal status, and the orientation of the MR images (sagittal vs axial).There is an association (P = .0015) between the luminal B subtype and a dynamic contrast material-enhancement feature that quantifies the relationship between lesion enhancement and background parenchymal enhancement. Cancers with a higher ratio of lesion enhancement rate to background parenchymal enhancement rate are more likely to be luminal B subtype.The luminal B subtype of breast cancer is associated with MR imaging features that relate the enhancement dynamics of the tumor and the background parenchyma.",
        "Background: The intima media thickness (IMT) has been established as an early predictor of general arteriosclerosis in patients with hypertension. However, to date, there is paucity of information on IMT of common carotid artery in healthy patients and in patients with risk factors for cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, diabetics and obesity in study area. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the carotid\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nintima media thickness in patients with hypertension and normotensive adults attending Jos University Teaching Hospital Jos, Nigeria.Materials and Methods: This prospective study was conducted over a period of four months (November 2012 to February 2013) on 200 hypertensive patients and 100 normotensive adults aged 18 \u2013 70 years. The common carotid artery (CCA) was scanned using an ALOKA SSD-3500 ultrasound scanner with Doppler facility and a 7.5MHz linear transducer. Three measurements of the CIMT were obtained at 1cm proximal to the right and left carotid bulb and the mean value of the three measurements was recorded.\r\nResults: The age range of the 300 patients comprising of 104 males and 196 females was 18 \u2013 70 years with a mean age of 41.44 \u00b112. The overall mean CIMT was 0.89mm\u00b10.13 and 0.61mm\u00b10.10 for hypertensive and normotensive subjects respectively. Mean CIMT was significantly higher in hypertensive compared to normotensive subjects (p=0.000). CIMT correlated positively with age and blood pressure in hypertensives but had a negative correlation with BMI. However in normotensives, CIMT correlated positively with age and BMI. Male hypertensives had higher CIMT when compared to female. In hypertensive subjects, overall right and left mean CIMT was 0.89 + 0.13 and 0.89 + 0.18, while in normotensives the overall right and left mean CIMT value was 0.61 + 0.10 and 0.60 \u00b1 0.10 respectively. There was no significant difference between the two sides.

Higher values of CIMT were seen in hypertensive subject compared to normotensive. Age, sex, BMI and blood pressure levels have significant effect on CIMT of hypertensive patients.",
        "Purpose To investigate the fat-water content of Achilles tendon xanthomas at baseline and after treatment and to compare this assessment with that of ultrasonography (US) and other magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-based parameters. Materials and Methods Forty-eight Achilles tendons with clinically apparent xanthomas in 24 patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) (six men, 18 women; mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 58 years \u00b1 9) were compared with 20 Achilles tendons in 10 control subjects without FH (two men, eight women; mean age, 62 years \u00b1 7). US imaging measurements (thickness, width, cross-sectional area, echogenicity) and 3.0-T MR imaging measurements (thickness, width, cross-sectional area, volume, and fat-water separation) of the Achilles tendons were obtained at baseline and in patients with FH at 3 and 6 months after treatment with probucol, a cholesterol-lowering agent. Nonparametric tests compared baseline data, whereas repeated-measures analyses assessed treatment change. Results At baseline, all US and MR imaging-based parameters were higher in xanthoma tendons compared with those in control tendons (all P < .05). The mean relative water content per unit volume was 71% higher (42.0% \u00b1 6.7) in xanthoma tendons than in control tendons (24.5% 6 5.8; P < .001). After 6 months of cholesterol-lowering treatment, only MR imaging measurements of tendon volume (P = .007), relative fat (P = .041), and relative water content (P < .001) showed significant changes. As relative tendon fat content decreased with treatment, relative water content increased. Conclusion Most of the enlargement of Achilles tendon xanthomas is due to an increase in water content rather than fat. For depicting treatment change, relative tendon water content was the most sensitive parameter, followed by tendon volume and relative tendon fat content. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To determine the long-term (10-year) survival of patients with colorectal liver metastases treated with radiofrequency (RF) ablation and systemic chemotherapy with intention to treat.Institutional review board approval was obtained for this study. From 1997 to 2006, 99 consecutive patients with 202 small (0.8-4.0 cm; mean: 2.2 cm \u00b1 1.1) metachronous colorectal liver metastases underwent ultrasonography-guided percutaneous RF ablation with internally-cooled electrodes in association with systemic chemotherapy. Patients ineligible for surgery (n = 80) or whose lesions were potentially resectable and who refused surgery (n = 19) were included. Patients were followed up with contrast agent-enhanced computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging for a minimum of 3 years to more than 10 years after RF ablation (n = 99, 67, 49, and 25 for 3, 5, 7, and 10 or more years, respectively). Overall local response rates and long-term survival rates were assessed. For each of these primary endpoints, Kaplan-Meier curves were generated and log-rank tests were used to assess for statistically significant differences.Primary and secondary technical success rates were 93.1% (188 of 202) and 100% (14 of 14), respectively. Local tumor progression occurred in 11.9% (24 of 202) metastases, and 54.2% (13 of 24) of these were re-treated. Patient survival rates increased with re-treatment versus no re-treatment (P < .001). At follow-up, 125 new liver metastases were found, and of these 32.8% (41 of 125) were treated with RF ablation. Overall survival rates were 98.0%, 69.3%, 47.8%, 25.0%, and 18.0% (median: 53.2 months) at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 years, respectively. The major complication rate was 1.3% (two of 156), and there were no procedure-related deaths. At the time this article was written, 32.3% (32 of 99) of the patients were alive, and 67.7% (67 of 99) were deceased, with a median follow-up of 72 months.Adding RF ablation to systemic chemotherapy achieved local control in a large majority of metachronous colorectal liver metastases. The 3- to 10-year survival rates of this relatively large series of patients were essentially equivalent to those of most surgical series reported in the literature.",
        "Background Deep learning (DL) algorithms are gaining extensive attention for their excellent performance in image recognition tasks. DL models can automatically make a quantitative assessment of complex medical image characteristics and achieve increased accuracy in diagnosis with higher efficiency. Purpose To determine the feasibility of using a DL approach to predict clinically negative axillary lymph node metastasis from US images in patients with primary breast cancer. Materials and Methods A data set of US images in patients with primary breast cancer with clinically negative axillary lymph nodes from Tongji Hospital (974 imaging studies from 2016 to 2018, 756 patients) and an independent test set from Hubei Cancer Hospital (81 imaging studies from 2018 to 2019, 78 patients) were collected. Axillary lymph node status was confirmed with pathologic examination. Three different convolutional neural networks (CNNs) of Inception V3, Inception-ResNet V2, and ResNet-101 architectures were trained on 90% of the Tongji Hospital data set and tested on the remaining 10%, as well as on the independent test set. The performance of the models was compared with that of five radiologists. The models' performance was analyzed in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristic curves, areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs), and heat maps. Results The best-performing CNN model, Inception V3, achieved an AUC of 0.89 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.83, 0.95) in the prediction of the final clinical diagnosis of axillary lymph node metastasis in the independent test set. The model achieved 85% sensitivity (35 of 41 images; 95% CI: 70%, 94%) and 73% specificity (29 of 40 images; 95% CI: 56%, 85%), and the radiologists achieved 73% sensitivity (30 of 41 images; 95% CI: 57%, 85%; P = .17) and 63% specificity (25 of 40 images; 95% CI: 46%, 77%; P = .34). Conclusion Using US images from patients with primary breast cancer, deep learning models can effectively predict clinically negative axillary lymph node metastasis. Artificial intelligence may provide an early diagnostic strategy for lymph node metastasis in patients with breast cancer with clinically negative lymph nodes. Published under a CC BY 4.0 license.

        "Image-guided tumor ablation has become a well-established hallmark of local cancer therapy. The breadth of options available in this growing field increases the need for standardization of terminology and reporting criteria to facilitate effective communication of ideas and appropriate comparison among treatments that use different technologies, such as chemical (eg, ethanol or acetic acid) ablation, thermal therapies (eg, radiofrequency, laser, microwave, focused ultrasound, and cryoablation) and newer ablative modalities such as irreversible electroporation. This updated consensus document provides a framework that will facilitate the clearest communication among investigators regarding ablative technologies. An appropriate vehicle is proposed for reporting the various aspects of image-guided ablation therapy including classification of therapies, procedure terms, descriptors of imaging guidance, and terminology for imaging and pathologic findings. Methods are addressed for standardizing reporting of technique, follow-up, complications, and clinical results. As noted in the original document from 2003, adherence to the recommendations will improve the precision of communications in this field, leading to more accurate comparison of technologies and results, and ultimately to improved patient outcomes.

        "Purpose To assess whether magnetic resonance (MR) angiography can be used as a noninvasive alternative to intraarterial digital subtraction angiography (DSA) to indicate additional treatment in the follow-up of patients with coil-treated intracranial aneurysms. Materials and Methods This was an ethics committee\u2013approved multicenter study. Consecutive patients who were scheduled for follow-up intraarterial DSA after coil placement were invited for additional MR angiography after providing written informed consent. Interventional neuroradiologists gave treatment advice (additional treatment, extended follow-up imaging, or discharge from follow-up) for each imaging modality. Agreement between treatment advices based on intraarterial DSA and MR angiographic findings and interobserver agreement were assessed with weighted \u03ba statistics. Results Agreement between intraarterial DSA- and MR angiography\u2013based treatment recommendations was substantial (\u03ba = 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.66, 0.80). In 34 of the 310 patients (11%), the advice was additional treatment based on findings of both modalities. In six patients (2%), the advice based on intraarterial DSA findings was additional treatment, while that based on MR angiographic findings was extended follow-up imaging; therefore, none of these patients were discharged from follow-up on the basis of MR angiographic findings. In six other patients (2%), the advice based on MR angiographic findings was additional treatment, while that based on intraarterial DSA findings was extended follow-up imaging (four patients), discharge from follow-up (one patient), and noninterpretable DSA (one patient). Extended follow-up imaging was suggested for 37 patients (12%) after intraarterial DSA and for 49 patients (16%) after MR angiography (difference: 4%; 95% CI: \u22120.6%, 8.4%). Interobserver agreement was substantial for intraarterial DSA (\u03ba = 0.73; 95% CI: 0.64, 0.82) and moderate for MR angiography (\u03ba = 0.53; 95% CI: 0.36, 0.70). Conclusion The overall proportion of patients advised to undergo additional treatment is similar based on intraarterial DSA and MR angiographic findings, with only few individual discrepancies. MR angiography can therefore be used for therapeutic decision making in the follow-up of patients with coil-treated aneurysms. \u00a9 RSNA, 2012 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.12112608/-/DC1",
        "Purpose To evaluate the effect and clinical importance of sunitinib on pancreatic volume in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). Materials and Methods This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board and compliant with HIPAA. The requirement to obtain informed consent was waived. The authors evaluated 65 patients with GIST treated with oral sunitinib and a control group of 30 patients with GIST who did not receive any therapy (mean age: 56 years [range, 29\u201375 years] vs 60 years [range, 27\u201378 years], respectively; P = .11) seen at their institution from January 2002 through December 2008. Segmented pancreatic volumes of study and control groups were measured with computed tomography by using commercial software by two independent readers who were blinded to study group and the timing of the scan at a median of 6.2 and 6.1 months, respectively. Pre- and posttreatment volumes (Wilcoxon signed rank test) and rate of volume change per month (Wilcoxon rank sum test) were compared. Interobserver agreement was calculated. Associations and prognostic importance of pancreatic atrophy were studied by using multivariate linear regression and Cox proportional analysis, respectively. Results Both readers recorded significant pancreatic volume loss in the study group (respective median pre- and posttreatment volume: 76.1 cm3 and 58.4 cm3 for reader 1 and 67.7 cm3 and 59.0 cm3 for reader 2; P < .0001 for both) but not in the control group (respective median pre- and posttreatment volume: 79.9 cm3 and 83.8 cm3 for reader 1 [P = .43] and 79.9 cm3 and 84.8 cm3 for reader 2 [P = .50]). The rate of volume loss per month was greater in the study group than in the control group (reader 1: \u22122.1% vs \u22120.1%, respectively, P = .003; reader 2: \u22122.0% vs \u22120.3%, P < .0001). Twenty-three of the 65 patients who received sunitinib (35%) showed at least 3% pancreatic volume loss per month, compared with only one of the 30 patients in the control group (3%). The concordance correlation coefficient for pre- and posttreatment measurements was 0.83 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.75, 0.89) and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.94), respectively, and the mean relative difference was 0.04% and 1.2%. Sunitinib treatment was independently associated with pancreatic atrophy (P = .03; risk estimate: 2.64; 95% CI: 0.17, 5.11). At Cox proportional analysis within the study group, more than 3%, more than 5%, and more than 7% loss per month were independently associated with worse survival (P < .001, hazard ratio: >1.00 for all). Conclusion Pancreatic atrophy is a sunitinib-associated toxicity detected at imaging. It may be a clinically important biomarker because a higher rate of pancreatic atrophy was independently associated with shorter survival. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016",
        "Background Radiomics extracts features from medical images more precisely and more accurately than visual assessment. However, radiomics features are affected by CT scanner parameters such as reconstruction kernel or section thickness, thus obscuring underlying biologically important texture features. Purpose To investigate whether a compensation method could correct for the variations of radiomic feature values caused by using different CT protocols. Materials and Methods Phantom data involving 10 texture patterns and 74 patients in cohorts 1 (19 men; 42 patients; mean age, 60.4 years; September-October 2013) and 2 (16 men; 32 patients; mean age, 62.1 years; January-September 2007) scanned by using different CT protocols were retrospectively included. For any radiomic feature, the compensation approach identified a protocol-specific transformation to express all data in a common space that were devoid of protocol effects. The differences in statistical distributions between protocols were assessed by using Friedman tests before and after compensation. Principal component analyses were performed on the phantom data to evaluate the ability to distinguish between texture patterns after compensation. Results In the phantom data, the statistical distributions of features were different between protocols for all radiomic features and texture patterns (P < .05). After compensation, the protocol effect was no longer detectable (P > .05). Principal component analysis demonstrated that each texture pattern was no longer displayed as different clusters corresponding to different imaging protocols, unlike what was observed before compensation. The correction for scanner effect was confirmed in patient data with 100% (10 of 10 features for cohort 1) and 98% (87 of 89 features for cohort 2) of P values less than .05 before compensation, compared with 30% (three of 10) and 15% (13 of 89) after compensation. Conclusion Image compensation successfully realigned feature distributions computed from different CT imaging protocols and should facilitate multicenter radiomic studies. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "To determine the variability of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values in various anatomic regions in the upper abdomen measured with magnetic resonance (MR) systems from different vendors and with different field strengths.Ten healthy men (mean age, 36.6 years \u00b1 7.7 [standard deviation]) gave written informed consent to participate in this prospective ethics committee-approved study. Diffusion-weighted (DW) MR imaging was performed in each subject with 1.5- and 3.0-T MR systems from each of three vendors at two institutions. Two readers independently measured ADC values in seven upper abdominal regions (left and right liver lobe, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and renal cortex and medulla). ADC values were tested for interobserver differences, as well as for differences related to field strength and vendor, with repeated-measures analysis of variance; coefficients of variation (CVs) and variance components were calculated.Interreader agreement was excellent (intraclass coefficient, 0.876). ADC values were (77.5-88.8) \u00d710(-5) mm(2)/sec in the spleen and (250.6-278.5) \u00d710(-5) mm(2)/sec in the gallbladder. There were no significant differences between ADC values measured at 1.5 T and those measured at 3.0 T in any anatomic region (P >.10 for all). In two of seven regions at 1.5 T (left and right liver lobes, P < .023) and in four of seven regions at 3.0 T (left liver lobe, pancreas, and renal cortex and medulla, P < .008), intervendor differences were significant. CVs ranged from 7.0% to 27.1% depending on the anatomic location.Despite significant intervendor differences in ADC values of various anatomic regions of the upper abdomen, ADC values of the gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and kidney may be comparable between MR systems from different vendors and between different field strengths.",
        "To test the hypothesis that an image noise reduction algorithm designed for digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in interventional neuroradiology enables a reduction in the patient entrance dose by a factor of 4 while maintaining image quality.This clinical prospective study was approved by the local ethics committee, and all 20 adult patients provided informed consent. DSA was performed with the default reference DSA program, a quarter-dose DSA program with modified acquisition parameters (to reduce patient radiation dose exposure), and a real-time noise-reduction algorithm. Two consecutive biplane DSA data sets were acquired in each patient. The dose-area product (DAP) was calculated for each image and compared. A randomized, blinded, offline reading study was conducted to show noninferiority of the quarter-dose image sets. Overall, 40 samples per treatment group were necessary to acquire 80% power, which was calculated by using a one-sided \u03b1 level of 2.5%.The mean DAP with the quarter-dose program was 25.3% \u00b1 0.8 of that with the reference program. The median overall image quality scores with the reference program were 9, 13, and 12 for readers 1, 2, and 3, respectively. These scores increased slightly to 12, 15, and 12, respectively, with the quarter-dose program imaging chain.In DSA, a change in technique factors combined with a real-time noise-reduction algorithm will reduce the patient entrance dose by 75%, without a loss of image quality.",

        "Purpose To elucidate whether echogenicity (EG) of the basal ganglia and thalami (BGT) represents a physiologic phenomenon in preterm neonates (<32 weeks gestation). Materials and Methods The study was approved by the medical ethics committee, and informed consent was obtained from the parents. Sequential neonatal cranial ultrasonographic (US) images obtained in 130 preterm neonates were evaluated for EG of the BGT. In 110 of the 130 neonates, MR imaging was performed around or within the first months after term-equivalent age to assess myelination and changes in BGT signal. Cranial US studies obtained in 83 low-risk near-term neonates were used for comparison. Results Diffuse homogeneous bilateral EG of the BGT was seen in 120 (92%) of 130 preterm neonates and in seven (8%) of 83 low-risk neonates (P < .001). In preterm neonates, EG of the BGT faded with age and was no longer seen 1 month after delivery. This finding was associated with frontal echodensity, which is a normal prematurity-related cranial US phenomenon that occurs in the white matter (P < .001). No association with changes on MR images was found. Conclusion In preterm neonates, diffuse homogeneous EG of the BGT is a frequent and normal prematurity-related finding. \u00a9 RSNA, 2011 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.10101086/-/DC1",
        "Background Increased cerebral signal intensity (SI) has been reported in patients undergoing MRI with gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs). Published data on gadobenate dimeglumine have been somewhat contradictory. Purpose To evaluate the relationship between dosage of gadobenate dimeglumine and SI change at MRI following multiple gadobenate dimeglumine administrations. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, patients referred for clinically indicated brain MRI from January 2006 through May 2016 were evaluated for inclusion. Eligible patients were between 18 and 90 years old at their baseline brain MRI and had never received a GBCA, had undergone three or more MRI examinations with gadobenate dimeglumine, and had the baseline scan and another brain MRI scan available for comparison. The primary group consisted of patients with four or fewer supratentorial lesions smaller than 3 cm who underwent axial T1-weighted MRI at 1.5 T. One patient had also undergone prior radiation therapy. The secondary group consisted of patients with a history of brain radiation therapy or craniotomy who underwent 1.5-T and 3-T same-plane T1-weighted MRI (in any order). The SI for up to eight brain MRI examinations per patient was measured, and relative SI changes from baseline to interval scans were calculated. A subgroup analysis was performed to assess the gadobenate dimeglumine washout since the last gadolinium exposure. All patients had normal renal and liver functions. Linear mixed regression analyses were performed for variables with P < .05. Results In 43 patients (14 men, 29 women; median age, 49 years; age range, 25\u201373 years), the dentate nucleus (DN)\u2013to\u2013middle cerebral peduncle (MCP) SI ratio showed a mean increase of 6.7% \u00b1 3.9 in the primary group and 4.0% \u00b1 2.7 in the secondary group (both P < .001) following the administration of 134 mL \u00b1 141 gadobenate dimeglumine over 55 months \u00b1 35.2. The DN/MCP SI ratio increased linearly with the amount of gadobenate dimeglumine, with a mean increase of 0.015% \u00b1 0.004 per 1 mL of gadobenate dimeglumine (R2 = 0.3, P < .001). Conclusion In patients receiving multiple doses of gadobenate dimeglumine, a linear relationship existed between gadobenate dimeglumine administrations and an increase in the dentate nucleus\u2013to\u2013middle cerebral peduncle signal intensity ratio at MRI. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020 See also the editorial by McDonald and Kallmes in this issue.",

She had ingested herbal medicine for physical conditioning for several years. Laboratory findings, including biochemistry, electrolyte levels, and complete blood count, were all within normal limits, except for elevated serum C-reactive protein level (7.719 mg/dL; normal range,<1 mg/dL). The patient underwent initial evaluation with conventional abdominal radiography (Fig 1). She underwent subsequent evaluation with noncontrast CT of the abdomen (Figs 2, 3) and colonoscopy (Fig 4).",
        "To describe imaging findings of early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, dynamic contrast material-enhanced computed tomography (CT), CT during arterial portography (CTAP), and CT during hepatic arteriography (CTHA) and to compare the diagnostic performance of each modality for small (\u2264 2 cm) HCC.The institute ethics committee deemed study approval unnecessary. One hundred eight resected small lesions in 64 patients were diagnosed as a dysplastic nodule (DN) (n = 12), progressed HCC (n = 66), or early HCC (n = 30). All but two patients underwent all imaging examinations. The imaging characteristics of the lesions with each modality were determined. To evaluate the diagnostic performance of the modalities, two radiologists graded the presence of HCC with use of a five-point confidence scale. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (A(z)), sensitivity, and specificity of each modality were compared.The imaging features that are statistically significant for differentiating an early HCC from a DN include fat-containing lesions at dual-echo T1-weighted MR imaging (seen in 16 of the 30 early HCCs and none of the DNs), low attenuation at unenhanced CT (seen in 13 of the 30 early HCCs and none of the DNs), low attenuation at CTAP (seen in 11 of the 30 early HCCs and none of the DNs), and low signal intensity at hepatocyte phase gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging (seen in 29 of the 30 early HCCs and none of the DNs). The diagnostic performance of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging (A(z), 0.98 and 0.99) was significantly greater than that of contrast-enhanced CT (A(z), 0.87) and CTHA-CTAP (A(z), 0.85 and 0.86) owing to its significantly higher sensitivity (P < .001).Gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging is the most useful imaging technique for evaluating small HCC, including early HCC.",
        "A 61-year-old woman was admitted to our institution to characterize an incidentally found mass in the porta hepatis. An episode of pulmonary embolism (18 months ago) and a pulmonary abscess (15 months ago) were reported. The patient had no history of known liver disease, previous cancer diagnosis, or trauma. She underwent total thyroidectomy for goiter several years ago, with initial iatrogenic hypothyroidism treated with levo-thyroxine hormone replacement therapy. During follow-up, this therapy was adjusted (50 \u00b5g per day) to induce euthyroidism and to achieve a target serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration of 1-2 mIU/L. Physical examination findings were unremarkable. Admission laboratory data were entirely normal, including tumor markers, such as carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9. Unenhanced (Fig 1) and multiphasic contrast-enhanced CT imaging was performed in arterial (Fig 2A), portal venous (Fig 2B), and delayed (3 minutes after injection) (Fig 2C) phases. Axial and coronal maximum intensity projection reconstructed CT images were obtained in the arterial (Fig 3) and portal venous (Fig 4) phases. Because of the imaging findings of the mass in the porta hepatis and concerns about malignancy, the patient underwent endoscopy.

        "To evaluate the diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-estimated proton density fat fraction (PDFF) for assessing hepatic steatosis in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) by using centrally scored histopathologic validation as the reference standard.This prospectively designed, cross-sectional, internal review board-approved, HIPAA-compliant study was conducted in 77 patients who had NAFLD and liver biopsy. MR imaging-PDFF was estimated from magnitude-based low flip angle multiecho gradient-recalled echo images after T2* correction and multifrequency fat modeling. Histopathologic scoring was obtained by consensus of the Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) Clinical Research Network Pathology Committee. Spearman correlation, additivity and variance stabilization for regression for exploring the effect of a number of potential confounders, and receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed.Liver MR imaging-PDFF was systematically higher, with higher histologic steatosis grade (P < .001), and was significantly correlated with histologic steatosis grade (\u03c1 = 0.69, P < .001). The correlation was not confounded by age, sex, lobular inflammation, hepatocellular ballooning, NASH diagnosis, fibrosis, or magnetic field strength (P = .65). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curves was 0.989 (95% confidence interval: 0.968, 1.000) for distinguishing patients with steatosis grade 0 (n = 5) from those with grade 1 or higher (n = 72), 0.825 (95% confidence interval: 0.734, 0.915) to distinguish those with grade 1 or lower (n = 31) from those with grade 2 or higher (n = 46), and 0.893 (95% confidence interval: 0.809, 0.977) to distinguish those with grade 2 or lower (n = 58) from those with grade 3 (n = 19).MR imaging-PDFF showed promise for assessment of hepatic steatosis grade in patients with NAFLD.

        "Purpose To evaluate the feasibility of cutaneous and subcutaneous limb tissue elasticity measurement in participants with limb lymphedema by using acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography. Materials and Methods From July 2015 to June 2017, ARFI elastography was performed in 64 participants with lymphedema (seven men and 57 women; age range, 23\u201385 years) by using a US system. Tissue stiffness quantification with shear-wave velocity (SWV) was obtained in the cutaneous and subcutaneous limb tissues. Lymphoscintigraphy was the reference standard. Results SWV was significantly higher in limbs with lymphatic obstruction than in unaffected limbs (cutaneous tissue: 2.75 m/sec vs 1.74 m/sec, respectively; subcutaneous tissue: 1.90 m/sec vs 1.35 m/sec, respectively; P < .001). SWV was significantly different among limbs without lymphatic drainage obstruction, with partial obstruction, and with total obstruction (cutaneous tissue: 1.74 m/sec vs 2.75 m/sec vs 2.77 m/sec; subcutaneous tissue: 1.35 m/sec vs 1.90 m/sec vs 1.90 m/sec, respectively; P < .001). By using a cut-off value of 2.10 m/sec and 1.43 m/sec for cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue, respectively, sensitivity was 83.1% (59 of 71) and 80.3% (57 of 71), and specificity was 86.0% (49 of 57) and 70.2% (40 of 57) for manifestation of lymphatic obstruction. The corresponding areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.91 and 0.83, respectively. Conclusion Acoustic radiation force impulse elastography showed that cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues are stiffer in lymphedematous limbs than in unaffected limbs. Acoustic radiation force impulse elastography is a feasible imaging modality for noninvasive tissue stiffness quantification in limb lymphedema. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To evaluate the prognostic value of the restaging system after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in patients with advanced-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Materials and Methods This study was approved by the clinical research committee and a written informed consent was required before enrolling in the study. Prospectively enrolled were 412 consecutive patients with stage III-IVb NPC treated with NACT followed by concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Patients were staged before NACT and restaged after NACT. The progression-free survival (PFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) were calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method, and differences were compared by using the log-rank test. Results Post-NACT T classification (PFS, P = .001) and N classification (PFS, P < .001; DMFS, P = .001) resulted in better survival curve separations than pre-NACT T classification and N classification. Patients downstaged from N2-N3 to N0-N1 disease had a better prognosis than did patients who continued to have N2-N3 diseases (3-year PFS, 83.8% vs 66.6%, P = .001; 3-year DMFS, 88.0% vs 78.4%, P = .026). Multivariate analysis revealed that post-NACT T classification (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.67; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.18, 2.36; P = .003) and post-NACT N classification (HR = 1.54; 95% CI: 1.17, 2.03; P = .002) were independent prognostic factors for PFS; also, post-NACT N classification (HR = 1.48; 95% CI: 1.05, 2.07; P = .025) was an independent prognostic factor for DMFS. Multivariate analysis in patients with N2-N3 disease demonstrated that the N downstaging effects of NACT was the only independent prognostic factor for PFS (HR = 0.48; 95% CI: 0.29, 0.81; P = .006) and DMFS (HR = 0.52; 95% CI: 0.28, 0.97; P = .039). Conclusion The post-NACT stage is more representative of prognosis than the pre-NACT stage in advanced-stage NPC patients, which suggests that major clinical decisions should be based on the post-NACT stage. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "History A 70-year-old man had a posterior left thigh lesion confirmed to be biopsy-proven melanoma. The patient underwent wide excision and sentinel node biopsy, which showed absence of residual melanoma. Two years later, the patient noticed a subcentimeter subcutaneous lump in his thigh. Repeat excisional biopsy showed involvement of the surrounding soft tissue, consistent with a satellite lesion. Follow-up combined PET/CT revealed satellite nodules around the primary lesion, enabling confirmation of subcutaneous metastatic disease. The patient was subsequently started on nivolumab, an anti\u2013programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor that blocks PD-1 and is approved as a first-line treatment in patients with advanced metastatic melanoma. On the baseline scan prior to starting nivolumab, there were no CT findings that suggested metastatic disease, nor were there enlarged mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes. Five months after initiation of nivolumab treatment, the first follow-up chest CT scan was performed and showed new findings in the mediastinum and bilateral lungs. The patient remained asymptomatic during the treatment period. Furthermore, the subcutaneous metastatic disease remained stable during the treatment period, and no other site of metastatic disease was noted on follow-up CT scans obtained during the first 5 months of treatment. The patient had no prior history of infectious or occupational exposures. During the nivolumab treatment cycle, his pertinent laboratory values and physical examination findings were unremarkable.",
        "Purpose To determine if commonly administered doses of technetium 99m (99mTc) mertiatide (MAG3) in the range of 300\u2013370 MBq (approximately 8\u201310 mCi) contribute to image interpretation and justify the resulting radiation exposure. Materials and Methods The respective institutional review boards approved this HIPAA-compliant study and waived informed consent. Baseline and furosemide 99mTc-MAG3 imaging examinations in 50 patients suspected of having renal obstruction and 48 patients suspected of having renovascular hypertension (RVH) were randomly selected from archived databases and were independently scored by three experienced readers without access to 2-second flow images. Readers were blinded to their original scores, and then they rescored each examination with access to high-activity 2-second flow images. Relative renal function was determined after a low activity (62.9 MBq \u00b1 40.7) baseline acquisition for RVH and a high activity (303.4 MBq \u00b1 48.1) acquisition after administration of enalaprilat. Data were analyzed by using random effects analysis of variance and mean and standard error of the mean for the difference between sets of scores and the difference between relative function measurements. Results There was no significant difference in the scores without flow images compared with blinded scores with high-activity flow images for patients suspected of having obstruction (P = .80) or RVH (P = .24). Moreover, there was no significant difference in the relative uptake measurements after administration of low and high activities (P > .99). Conclusion Administered doses of 99mTc-MAG3 in the range of 300\u2013370 MBq (approximately 8\u201310 mCi) do not affect the relative function measurements or contribute to interpretation of images in patients suspected of having RVH or obstruction compared with administration of lower doses; unnecessary radiation exposure can be avoided by administering doses in the range of 37\u2013185 MBq as recommended incurrent guidelines. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017",

For index category LR-2, LR-3, and LR-4 observations, the proportions that progressed, remained stable, or decreased in category were calculated. Cumulative incidence curves for progression were compared according to baseline LI-RADS category (by using log-rank tests). Results All 63 index LR-2 observations remained stable or decreased in category. Among 166 index LR-3 observations, seven (4%) progressed to LR-5, and eight (5%) progressed to LR-4. Among 52 index LR-4 observations, 20 (38%) progressed to a malignant category. The cumulative incidence of progression to a malignant category was higher for index LR-4 observations than for index LR-3 or LR-2 observations (each P < .001) but was not different between LR-3 and LR-2 observations (P = .155). The cumulative incidence of progression to at least category LR-4 was trend-level higher for index LR-3 observations than for LR-2 observations (P = .0502). Conclusion Observations classified according to LI-RADS version 2014 categories are associated with different imaging outcomes. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To assess diagnostic performance and interreader agreement of tumor-to-sinus distance measurements and visual assessment of renal sinus fat invasion at T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging as predictors of muscular venous branch invasion (MVBI) in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Materials and Methods The institutional review board approved this retrospective study and waived the informed consent requirement. The study was HIPAA compliant. A total of 186 consecutive patients underwent preoperative 1.5-T MR imaging; 188 RCCs were identified. Blinded to histopathologic information, two readers independently measured the tumor-to-sinus distance and assessed renal sinus fat invasion on transverse and coronal T2-weighted MR images. Interreader agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient, Cohen \u03ba) and performance characteristics of imaging tests were calculated. Histopathologic findings served as the standard of reference. Results Histopathologic findings indicated MVBI in 35% (66 of 188) of tumors. At imaging, all tumors with MVBI had a tumor-to-sinus distance of 0 mm. All tumors with renal sinus fat invasion at imaging had MVBI. Sensitivity and specificity for the detection of renal sinus fat invasion were 100% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 92%, 100%) and 94% (95% CI: 89%, 98%). In the absence of renal sinus fat invasion at imaging, a tumor-to-sinus distance of 0 mm was associated with MVBI in 21% (18 of 86) of cases. Interreader agreement for quantitative (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.92; 95% CI: 0.89, 0.94) and qualitative (\u03ba = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.81, 0.96) assessments was excellent. Conclusion Tumor-to-sinus distance measurements and the assessment of renal sinus fat invasion at T2-weighted MR imaging can be used reliably to rule out MVBI in patients with RCC. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "To assess the technical success rate and diagnostic performance of liver magnetic resonance (MR) elastography.This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board with patient informed consent. A total of 1377 consecutive MR elastography examinations performed between 2007 and 2010 in 1287 patients for clinical indications were included. Medical records were used to retrieve liver stiffness as assessed with MR elastography, histologic analysis, blood work, and other liver disease-related information. Nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis tests and analysis of covariance methods were used to evaluate the diagnostic values and relationships of the collected data.Hepatic MR elastography had a success rate of 94.4% (1300 of 1377 cases) and yielded reproducible measurements (r = 0.9716, P < .0001) in the study cohort, with a complex patient profile and multiple interpreters. Body mass index had no significant effect on success rate (P = .2). In 289 patients who underwent liver biopsy within 1 year of the MR elastography date, mean liver stiffness as assessed with MR elastography was significantly higher in patients with advanced fibrosis (stages F3, F4) than in those with mild to moderate fibrosis (stages F0, F1, F2) (5.93 kPa \u00b1 2.31 [standard deviation] vs 3.35 kPa \u00b1 1.44, P < .0001). Liver stiffness is associated with many factors other than fibrosis extent, including cause of fibrosis (viral hepatitis C vs nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, P = .025), inflammation (severe vs mild to moderate, P = .03), and hepatic metabolic and synthetic function (no fibrosis vs intermediate fibrosis, P \u2264 .01).In a general clinical practice environment, hepatic MR elastography is a robust imaging method with a high success rate in a broad spectrum of patients. It also shows the complex association between liver stiffness and hepatic pathophysiology.",
        "Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has widely spread all over the world since the beginning of 2020. It is desirable to develop automatic and accurate detection of COVID-19 using chest CT. Purpose To develop a fully automatic framework to detect COVID-19 using chest CT and evaluate its performance. Materials and Methods In this retrospective and multicenter study, a deep learning model, the COVID-19 detection neural network (COVNet), was developed to extract visual features from volumetric chest CT scans for the detection of COVID-19. CT scans of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and other non-pneumonia abnormalities were included to test the robustness of the model. The datasets were collected from six hospitals between August 2016 and February 2020. Diagnostic performance was assessed with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, and specificity. Results The collected dataset consisted of 4352 chest CT scans from 3322 patients. The average patient age (\u00b1standard deviation) was 49 years \u00b1 15, and there were slightly more men than women (1838 vs 1484, respectively; P = .29). The per-scan sensitivity and specificity for detecting COVID-19 in the independent test set was 90% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 83%, 94%; 114 of 127 scans) and 96% (95% CI: 93%, 98%; 294 of 307 scans), respectively, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.96 (P < .001). The per-scan sensitivity and specificity for detecting CAP in the independent test set was 87% (152 of 175 scans) and 92% (239 of 259 scans), respectively, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.97). Conclusion A deep learning model can accurately detect coronavirus 2019 and differentiate it from community-acquired pneumonia and other lung conditions. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "HistoryA 55-year-old man with a history of chronic pancreatitis secondary to chronic alcohol abuse presented to the hospital with acute abdominal pain, generalized weakness, weight loss, and pyrexia. A clinical examination revealed he was tender to touch in the upper abdomen. Laboratory tests revealed a serum alkaline phosphatase level of 370 U/L (6.1 \u00b5kat/L) (normal range, 30-130 U/L [0.5-2.2 \u00b5kat/L]), a lipase level of 172 U/L (2.9 \u00b5kat/L) (normal range, 0-60 U/L [0-1.0 \u00b5kat/L]), a C-reactive protein level of 159 mg/L (1514 nmol/L) (normal value, <8.0 mg/L [76.2 nmol/L]), and a white cell count of 7 \u00d7 109/L (normal range, [4-11] \u00d7 109/L).

        "Purpose To compare the biopsy rate and diagnostic accuracy before and after applying the American College of Radiology (ACR) Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) criteria for thyroid nodule evaluation. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, eight radiologists with 3-32 years experience in thyroid ultrasonography (US) reviewed US features of 100 thyroid nodules that were cytologically proven, pathologically proven, or both in December 2016. The radiologists evaluated nodule features in five US categories and provided biopsy recommendations based on their own practice patterns without knowledge of ACR TI-RADS criteria. Another three expert radiologists served as the reference standard readers for the imaging findings. ACR TI-RADS criteria were retrospectively applied to the features assigned by the eight radiologists to produce biopsy recommendations. Comparison was made for biopsy rate, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Results Fifteen of the 100 nodules (15%) were malignant. The mean number of nodules recommended for biopsy by the eight radiologists was 80 \u00b1 16 (standard deviation) (range, 38-95 nodules) based on their own practice patterns and 57 \u00b1 11 (range, 37-73 nodules) with retrospective application of ACR TI-RADS criteria. Without ACR TI-RADS criteria, readers had an overall sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 95% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 83%, 99%), 20% (95% CI: 16%, 25%), and 28% (95% CI: 21%, 37%), respectively. After applying ACR TI-RADS criteria, overall sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 92% (95% CI: 68%, 98%), 44% (95% CI: 33%, 56%), and 52% (95% CI: 40%, 63%), respectively. Although fewer malignancies were recommended for biopsy with ACR TI-RADS criteria, the majority met the criteria for follow-up US, with only three of 120 (2.5%) malignancy encounters requiring no follow-up or biopsy. Expert consensus recommended biopsy in 55 of 100 nodules with ACR TI-RADS criteria. Their sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 87% (95% CI: 48%, 98%), 51% (95% CI: 40%, 62%), and 56% (95% CI: 46%, 66%), respectively. Conclusion ACR TI-RADS criteria offer a meaningful reduction in the number of thyroid nodules recommended for biopsy and significantly improve the accuracy of recommendations for nodule management. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "In September 2015, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) published a report titled \"Improving Diagnosis in Health Care,\" in which it was recommended that \"health care organizations should adopt policies and practices that promote a nonpunitive culture that values open discussion and feedback on diagnostic performance.\" It may seem counterintuitive that a report addressing a highly technical skill such as medical diagnosis would be focused on organizational culture. The wisdom becomes clearer, however, when examined in the light of recent advances in the understanding of human error and individual and organizational performance. The current dominant model for radiologist performance improvement is scoring-based peer review, which reflects a traditional quality assurance approach, derived from manufacturing in the mid-1900s. Far from achieving the goals of the IOM, which are celebrating success, recognizing mistakes as an opportunity to learn, and fostering openness and trust, we have found that scoring-based peer review tends to drive radiologists inward, against each other, and against practice leaders. Modern approaches to quality improvement focus on using and enhancing interpersonal professional relationships to achieve and maintain high levels of individual and organizational performance. In this article, the authors review the recommendations set forth by the recent IOM report, discuss the science and theory that underlie several of those recommendations, and assess how well they fit with the current dominant approach to radiology peer review. The authors also offer an alternative approach to peer review: peer feedback, learning, and improvement (or more succinctly, \"peer learning\"), which they believe is better aligned with the principles promoted by the IOM. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016",
        "Background Evaluation of the glymphatic system with intrathecal contrast material injection has limited clinical use. Purpose To investigate the feasibility of using serial intravenous contrast-enhanced T1 mapping in the quantitative evaluation of putative dynamic glymphatic activity in various brain regions and to demonstrate the effect of sleep on glymphatic activity in humans. Materials and Methods In this prospective study from May 2019 to February 2020, 25 healthy participants (mean age, 25 years \u00b1 2 [standard deviation]; 15 men) underwent two cycles of MRI (day and night cycles). For each cycle, T1 maps were acquired at baseline and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, and 12 hours after intravenous contrast material injection. For the night cycle, participants had a normal night of sleep between 2 and 12 hours. The time (tmin) to reach the minimum T1 value (T1min), the absolute difference between baseline T1 and T1min (peak \u0394T1), and the slope between two measurements at 2 and 12 hours (slope[2h-12h]) were determined from T1 value-time curves in cerebral gray matter (GM), cerebral white matter (WM), cerebellar GM, cerebellar WM, and putamen. Mixed-model analysis of variance (ANOVA), Friedman test, and repeated-measures ANOVA were used to assess the effect of sleep on slope(2h-12h) and to compare tmin and peak \u0394T1 among different regions. Results The slope(2h-12h) increased from the day to night cycles in cerebral GM, cerebellar GM, and putamen (geometric mean ratio [night/day] = 1.4 [95% CI: 1.2, 1.7], 1.3 [95% CI: 1.1, 1.4], and 2.4 [95% CI: 1.6, 3.6], respectively; P = .001, P < .001, and P < .001, respectively). Median tmin values were 0.5 hour in cerebral and cerebellar GM and putamen for both cycles. Cerebellar GM had the highest mean peak \u0394T1, followed by cerebral GM and putamen in both day (159 msec \u00b1 6, 99 msec \u00b1 4, and 62 msec \u00b1 5, respectively) and night (152 msec \u00b1 6, 104 msec \u00b1 6, and 58 msec \u00b1 4, respectively) cycles. Conclusion Clearance of a gadolinium-based contrast agent was greater after sleep compared with daytime wakefulness. These results suggest that sleep was associated with greater glymphatic clearance compared with wakefulness. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "In this retrospective study, chest CTs of 121 symptomatic patients infected with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) from four centers in China from January 18, 2020 to February 2, 2020 were reviewed for common CT findings in relationship to the time between symptom onset and the initial CT scan (i.e. early, 0-2 days (36 patients), intermediate 3-5 days (33 patients), late 6-12 days (25 patients)). The hallmarks of COVID-19 infection on imaging were bilateral and peripheral ground-glass and consolidative pulmonary opacities. Notably, 20/36 (56%) of early patients had a normal CT. With a longer time after the onset of symptoms, CT findings were more frequent, including consolidation, bilateral and peripheral disease, greater total lung involvement, linear opacities, \"crazy-paving\" pattern and the \"reverse halo\" sign. Bilateral lung involvement was observed in 10/36 early patients (28%), 25/33 intermediate patients (76%), and 22/25 late patients (88%).",
        "Incomplete reporting has been identified as a major source of avoidable waste in biomedical research. Essential information is often not provided in study reports, impeding the identification, critical appraisal, and replication of studies. To improve the quality of reporting of diagnostic accuracy studies, the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (STARD) statement was developed. Here we present STARD 2015, an updated list of 30 essential items that should be included in every report of a diagnostic accuracy study. This update incorporates recent evidence about sources of bias and variability in diagnostic accuracy and is intended to facilitate the use of STARD. As such, STARD 2015 may help to improve completeness and transparency in reporting of diagnostic accuracy studies.",
        "Purpose To compare positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and PET/computed tomography (CT) for lesion detection and interpretation, quantification of fluorine 18 (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake, and accuracy of MR-based PET attenuation correction in pediatric patients with solid tumors. Materials and Methods This prospective study had local ethics committee and German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices approval. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients and legal guardians. Twenty whole-body 18F-FDG PET/CT and 18F-FDG PET/MR examinations were performed in 18 pediatric patients (median age, 14 years; range, 11\u201317 years). 18F-FDG PET/CT and 18F-FDG PET/MR data were acquired sequentially on the same day for all patients. PET standardized uptake values (SUVs) were quantified with volume of interest measurements in lesions and healthy tissues. MR-based PET attenuation correction was compared with CT-derived attenuation maps (\u00b5-maps). Lesion detection was assessed with separate reading of PET/CT and PET/MR data. Estimates of radiation dose were derived from the applied doses of 18F-FDG and CT protocol parameters. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed to report correlation coefficients and relative deviations for comparison of SUVs, rates of lesion detection, and percentage reductions in radiation dose. Results PET SUVs showed strong correlations between PET of PET/CT (PETCT) and PET of PET/MR (PETMR) (r > 0.85 for most tissues). Apart from drawbacks of MR-based PET attenuation correction in osseous structures and lungs, similar SUVs were found on PET images corrected with CT-based \u00b5-maps (13.1% deviation of SUVs for bone marrow and <5% deviation for other tissues). Lesion detection rate with PET/MR imaging was equivalent to that with PET/CT (61 areas of focal uptake on PETMR images vs 62 areas on PETCT images). Advantages of PET/MR were observed especially in soft-tissue regions. Furthermore, PET/MR offered significant dose reduction (73%) compared with PET/CT. Conclusion Pediatric oncologic PET/MR is technically feasible, showing satisfactory performance for PET quantification with SUVs similar to those of PET/CT. Compared with PET/CT, PET/MR demonstrates equivalent lesion detection rates while offering markedly reduced radiation exposure. Thus, PET/MR is a promising modality for the clinical work-up of pediatric malignancies. \u00a9 RSNA, 2014 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To combine fluorine 19 ((19)F) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and golden angle radial acquisition and to assess the feasibility of (19)F MR imaging golden angle-based tracking for catheter tracking applications and simultaneous three-dimensional (3D) intestinal tracking of ingested (19)F-labeled capsules in vivo.Approval from the local ethical committee and informed consent from the subject were obtained. In vitro studies were performed to assess (19)F MR imaging golden angle-based tracking reliability with regard to temporal resolution and different tracking strategies (boundary condition-free tracking, composite image-based tracking, and model-based tracking). In vivo performance of the method was investigated in one healthy volunteer on 2 days. On study day 1, a duodenal catheter incorporating five (19)F-labeled capsules was administered nasally, and its 3D movement was tracked inside the stomach and esophagus. On study day 2, three (19)F-labeled capsules were swallowed, and intestinal movement was tracked.Simultaneous in vivo 3D tracking of multiple (19)F-labeled capsules was successfully performed without incorporation of boundary conditions at a temporal resolution of 252 msec. Incorporation of boundary conditions with composite image-based tracking and model-based tracking increased tracking reliability and enabled temporal resolution as high as 108 msec.Use of (19)F MR imaging golden angle-based capsule tracking enables in vivo tracking of (19)F-labeled capsules and catheters at high temporal resolution. The presented method is applicable to physioanatomic studies of the gastrointestinal tract and shows potential for real-time tracking in interventional radiology.",
        "Purpose To determine whether whole-body total lesion glycolysis (TLG), which combines volumetric and metabolic information from fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT), can provide a better evaluation of the prognosis for non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Materials and Methods The institutional review board approved this retrospective study, and the requirement to obtain informed consent was waived. The authors identified 105 consecutive patients with NSCLC who underwent staging FDG PET/CT before any therapy. These patients were free of brain metastasis and underwent standard treatment and subsequent clinical follow-up. Metabolic tumor volume (MTV), mean standardized uptake value (SUV), and maximum SUV of each tumor over the whole body were determined. Whole-body MTV and whole-body TLG are the summation of all the MTVs and summation of individual tumor volume multiplied by its mean SUV, respectively. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the prognostic significance of whole-body TLG and other factors, including whole-body MTV, lung TLG, lung MTV, maximum SUV, sex, age, performance status, histologic subtype, T stage, N stage, clinical stage, and treatment method. Results The median follow-up time was 3.1 years. The estimated median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for the cohort was 10.8 months and 2.8 years, respectively. The 1-year PFS was 0.0% for patients with high whole-body TLG (>655) and 50.0% for those with low whole-body TLG (\u2264655). The 1-year OS was 58.8% for patients with high whole-body TLG and 84.1% for those with low whole-body TLG. Univariate analysis showed that whole-body TLG, whole-body MTV, lung TLG, lung MTV, maximum SUV, performance status, T stage, N stage, clinical stage, and treatment type (surgery vs other) were significant prognostic factors for PFS (P < .01 for all). With use of the forward stepwise multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, whole-body TLG (hazard ratio = 2.92; 95% confidence interval: 1.62, 5.26; P < .01) and surgical treatment (hazard ratio = 4.24; 95% confidence interval: 2.54, 7.07; P < .01) remained significant in PFS. Conclusion Whole-body TLG is of prognostic value for NSCLC. It may be a promising tool for stratifying patients with NSCLC for risk-adapted therapies. \u00a9 RSNA, 2012",
        "Purpose To determine the relationship between tumor heterogeneity assessed by means of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging texture analysis and survival outcomes in patients with primary breast cancer. Materials and Methods Between January and August 2010, texture analysis of the entire primary breast tumor in 203 patients was performed with T2-weighted and contrast material\u2013enhanced T1-weighted subtraction MR imaging for preoperative staging. Histogram-based uniformity and entropy were calculated. To dichotomize texture parameters for survival analysis, the 10-fold cross-validation method was used to determine cutoff points in the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to determine the association of texture parameters and morphologic or volumetric information obtained at MR imaging or clinical-pathologic variables with recurrence-free survival (RFS). Results There were 26 events, including 22 recurrences (10 local-regional and 12 distant) and four deaths, with a mean follow-up time of 56.2 months. In multivariate analysis, a higher N stage (RFS hazard ratio, 11.15 [N3 stage]; P = .002, Bonferroni-adjusted \u03b1 = .0167), triple-negative subtype (RFS hazard ratio, 16.91; P < .001, Bonferroni-adjusted \u03b1 = .0167), high risk of T1 entropy (less than the cutoff values [mean, 5.057; range, 5.022\u20135.167], RFS hazard ratio, 4.55; P = .018), and T2 entropy (equal to or higher than the cutoff values [mean, 6.013; range, 6.004\u20136.035], RFS hazard ratio = 9.84; P = .001) were associated with worse outcomes. Conclusion Patients with breast cancers that appeared more heterogeneous on T2-weighted images (higher entropy) and those that appeared less heterogeneous on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted subtraction images (lower entropy) exhibited poorer RFS. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To prospectively assess the accuracy of contrast agent-enhanced (CE) ultrasonography (US) with a second-generation US contrast agent in the detection and classification of endoleaks after endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (EVAR), with computed tomographic (CT) angiography as the reference standard.Institutional review board and written informed consent were obtained. Thirty-five patients who underwent EVAR were enrolled in a prospective study that consisted of CT angiography and CE US studies performed at 1- and 6-month follow-up and performed yearly thereafter. CE US was performed after bolus injection of 2.4 mL of sulfur hexafluoride by using equipment with specific software for contrast studies. Angiography was performed in patients who had type II endoleaks with an increase in aneurysm sac size and in patients with type I or III endoleaks. CE US sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy were determined for endoleak detection, and Cohen \u03ba statistic was used to assess agreement of CE US and CT angiographic findings for endoleak classification.A total of 126 CT angiographic and CE US studies were performed. CT angiography depicted 34 endoleaks in 16 patients (type IA, n=1; type IB, n=1; type II inferior mesenteric artery, n=2; type II lumbar artery, n=28; type II complex, inferior mesenteric, and lumbar arteries, n=2). CE US depicted 33 endoleaks.

CE US enabled correct classification of 26 of 33 endoleaks. No clinically important endoleak was missed at CE US.CE US yields good sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in endoleak detection, and it might represent a noninvasive tool that can be used in the follow-up of patients who undergo EVAR.",
        "The Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System (O-RADS) US risk stratification and management system is designed to provide consistent interpretations, to decrease or eliminate ambiguity in US reports resulting in a higher probability of accuracy in assigning risk of malignancy to ovarian and other adnexal masses, and to provide a management recommendation for each risk category. It was developed by an international multidisciplinary committee sponsored by the American College of Radiology and applies the standardized reporting tool for US based on the 2018 published lexicon of the O-RADS US working group. For risk stratification, the O-RADS US system recommends six categories (O-RADS 0-5), incorporating the range of normal to high risk of malignancy. This unique system represents a collaboration between the pattern-based approach commonly used in North America and the widely used, European-based, algorithmic-style International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) Assessment of Different Neoplasias in the Adnexa model system, a risk prediction model that has undergone successful prospective and external validation. The pattern approach relies on a subgroup of the most predictive descriptors in the lexicon based on a retrospective review of evidence prospectively obtained in the IOTA phase 1-3 prospective studies and other supporting studies that assist in differentiating management schemes in a variety of almost certainly benign lesions. With O-RADS US working group consensus, guidelines for management in the different risk categories are proposed. Both systems have been stratified to reach the same risk categories and management strategies regardless of which is initially used. At this time, O-RADS US is the only lexicon and classification system that encompasses all risk categories with their associated management schemes.",
        "Purpose To evaluate the feasibility of using intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) diffusion-weighted imaging with multiple b values for the noninvasive diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Materials and Methods This study was approved by the institutional animal care and use committee. Twenty-seven 8-week-old rabbits were fed a variety of diets (from a standard diet to a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet) before IVIM diffusion-weighted imaging was performed with seven b values by using a 3-T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging unit. At histologic analysis of the animals, livers were categorized by NAFLD severity as normal, NAFLD, borderline nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), or NASH. The apparent diffusion coefficient and IVIM-derived parameters including true diffusion coefficient, pseudodiffusion coefficient, and perfusion fraction of the liver parenchyma were measured. Each parameter was correlated with NAFLD severity, and optimal cutoff values were determined by means of receiver operating characteristics analysis. Results Perfusion fraction was significantly lower in rabbits with NAFLD than in those with a normal liver, and it decreased further as severity of NAFLD increased, with medians of 22.2%, 14.8%, 11.3%, and 9.5% in the rabbits in the normal, NAFLD, borderline, and NASH groups, respectively (\u03c1 = \u22120.83, P < .001). Apparent diffusion coefficient, true diffusion coefficient, and pseudodiffusion coefficient were not significantly different between the NAFLD severity groups. In terms of the diagnostic performance of perfusion fraction, area under the curve values were 0.984 (normal vs NAFLD or more severe disease), 0.959 (NAFLD or less severe vs borderline or more severe disease), and 0.903 (borderline or less severe vs NASH) with optimal cutoff values of 15.2%, 13.2%, and 11.0%, respectively. Conclusion Perfusion fractions extracted from IVIM diffusion-weighted imaging may help in the differentiation of early stage NASH from simple steatosis. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",

In the internal test set, the DL tool achieved 89.9% (98 of 109; 95% CI: 82.7, 94.9) sensitivity and 95.9% (141 of 147; 95% CI: 91.3, 98.5) specificity (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.96; 95% CI: 0.94, 0.99), without a significant difference (P = .11) in sensitivity compared with the original radiologist report (96.1% [98 of 102]; 95% CI: 90.3, 98.9). In a test set of 1473 real-world CT studies (669 malignant, 804 control) from institutions throughout Taiwan, the DL tool distinguished between CT malignant and control studies with 89.7% (600 of 669; 95% CI: 87.1, 91.9) sensitivity and 92.8% specificity (746 of 804; 95% CI: 90.8, 94.5) (AUC, 0.95; 95% CI: 0.94, 0.96), with 74.7% (68 of 91; 95% CI: 64.5, 83.3) sensitivity for malignancies smaller than 2 cm. Conclusion The deep learning-based tool enabled accurate detection of pancreatic cancer on CT scans, with reasonable sensitivity for tumors smaller than 2 cm. \u00a9 RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "To test the in vivo feasibility of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of ischemia reperfusion injury after syngeneic lung transplantation in mice and to characterize tissue relaxation properties by using very short echo-time (TE) sequences at 4.7 T.The experimental protocol was approved by the institutional animal committee. MR imaging was performed in six C57BL/6 mice 24 hours after the animals underwent syngeneic orthotopic left lung transplantation. A small-animal MR imager was equipped with a linear polarized hydrogen birdcage mouse coil. In addition to conventional T1-weighted spoiled gradient-echo and T2-weighted fast spin-echo sequences, three-dimensional very short TE sequences (50-5000 \u03bcsec) were performed. Color-encoded parametric maps of T2* transverse relaxation times were calculated on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Quantitative T2* values of the parenchyma of the transplanted lungs and relative spin density were compared by using region-of-interest analysis with the two-sided paired Student t test. After MR imaging, transplanted lungs were processed for histologic examination.Transplanted ventilated lungs in all the mice showed similar low signal intensity with the conventional T1- and T2-weighted sequences. The very short TE sequence exhibited signal yield in the lungs that was higher than that of the noise level. Increased spin density (50.8% \u00b1 26.9 [standard deviation], P = .006) and longer T2* relaxation time (1041 \u03bcsec \u00b1 424, P = .016) were found in the transplanted lungs. Best visualization was possible using color-encoded log-transformed parametric T2* maps. Conventional T2-weighted sequences revealed small pleural effusions. Histologic examination demonstrated ischemia reperfusion injury with a predominance of either cell influx or edema.Ischemia reperfusion injury after syngeneic lung transplantation can be visualized and characterized using very short TE sequences showing different MR imaging relaxation properties when compared with normal lung parenchyma.",
        "Purpose To prospectively assess the effects of an exercise intervention on organ-specific fat accumulation and cardiac function in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Materials and Methods Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, and the study protocol was approved by the medical ethics committee. The study followed 12 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (seven men; mean age, 46 years \u00b1 2 [standard error]) before and after 6 months of moderate-intensity exercise, followed by a high-altitude trekking expedition with exercise of long duration. Abdominal, epicardial, and paracardial fat volume were measured by using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Cardiac function was quantified with cardiac MR, and images were analyzed by a researcher who was supervised by a senior researcher (4 and 21 years of respective experience in cardiac MR). Hepatic, myocardial, and intramyocellular triglyceride (TG) content relative to water were measured with proton MR spectroscopy at 1.5 and 7 T. Two-tailed paired t tests were used for statistical analysis. Results Exercise reduced visceral abdominal fat volume from 348 mL \u00b1 57 to 219 mL \u00b1 33 (P < .01), and subcutaneous abdominal fat volume remained unchanged (P = .9). Exercise decreased hepatic TG content from 6.8% \u00b1 2.3 to 4.6% \u00b1 1.6 (P < .01) and paracardial fat volume from 4.6 mL \u00b1 0.9 to 3.7 mL \u00b1 0.8 (P = .02). Exercise did not change epicardial fat volume (P = .9), myocardial TG content (P = .9), intramyocellular lipid content (P = .3), or cardiac function (P = .5). Conclusion A 6-month exercise intervention in type 2 diabetes mellitus decreased hepatic TG content and visceral abdominal and paracardial fat volume, which are associated with increased cardiovascular risk, but cardiac function was unaffected. Tissue-specific exercise-induced changes in body fat distribution in type 2 diabetes mellitus were demonstrated in this study. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "Purpose To develop and validate a deep learning-based automatic detection algorithm (DLAD) for malignant pulmonary nodules on chest radiographs and to compare its performance with physicians including thoracic radiologists. Materials and Methods For this retrospective study, DLAD was developed by using 43 292 chest radiographs (normal radiograph-to-nodule radiograph ratio, 34 067:9225) in 34 676 patients (healthy-to-nodule ratio, 30 784:3892; 19 230 men [mean age, 52.8 years; age range, 18-99 years]; 15 446 women [mean age, 52.3 years; age range, 18-98 years]) obtained between 2010 and 2015, which were labeled and partially annotated by 13 board-certified radiologists, in a convolutional neural network. Radiograph classification and nodule detection performances of DLAD were validated by using one internal and four external data sets from three South Korean hospitals and one U.S. hospital. For internal and external validation, radiograph classification and nodule detection performances of DLAD were evaluated by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and jackknife alternative free-response receiver-operating characteristic (JAFROC) figure of merit (FOM), respectively. An observer performance test involving 18 physicians, including nine board-certified radiologists, was conducted by using one of the four external validation data sets. Performances of DLAD, physicians, and physicians assisted with DLAD were evaluated and compared. Results According to one internal and four external validation data sets, radiograph classification and nodule detection performances of DLAD were a range of 0.92-0.99 (AUROC) and 0.831-0.924 (JAFROC FOM), respectively. DLAD showed a higher AUROC and JAFROC FOM at the observer performance test than 17 of 18 and 15 of 18 physicians, respectively (P < .05), and all physicians showed improved nodule detection performances with DLAD (mean JAFROC FOM improvement, 0.043; range, 0.006-0.190; P < .05). Conclusion This deep learning-based automatic detection algorithm outperformed physicians in radiograph classification and nodule detection performance for malignant pulmonary nodules on chest radiographs, and it enhanced physicians' performances when used as a second reader. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "History A 46-year-old woman with known mixed connective tissue disease with clinical features of scleroderma and polymyositis and who was not on specific medications was referred to our institution to assess for interstitial lung disease due to her predisposing condition. She was a nonsmoker, had no respiratory symptoms, and enjoyed good exercise tolerance. She did not have any cutaneous lesions or renal disease. There was no family history of pulmonary or systemic disease. Her routine blood test results revealed a white blood cell count of 4.6 \u00d7 109/L (normal range, [4.4-10.1] \u00d7 109/L), a hemoglobin level of 7.76 mmol/L (normal range, 7.26-9.18 mmol/L), a platelet count of 189 \u00d7 109/L (normal range, [170-380] \u00d7 109/L), a bilirubin level of 8 mmol/L (normal range, <19 mmol/L), and a creatinine level of 63 mmol/L (normal range, 45-82 mmol/L), all within normal limits. Lung function tests at presentation yielded normal results, with a diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide of 95% and a forced vital capacity of 2.29 (98% predicted value). However, this patient had an elevated serum globulin level of 47 g/L (normal range, 26-32 g/L) and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 36 mm/h (normal range, 0-20 mm/h), while C-reactive protein level was normal at less than 0.35 mg/dL. She was seropositive for antinuclear (titer >1/720), anti-Ro, anti-La, and anti-extractable nuclear antigen antibodies. Chest radiography and CT were performed at presentation and 14-year follow-up. PET/CT was performed at 7- and 13-year follow-up. Throughout this 14-year follow-up period, she remained completely free of respiratory symptoms and continued to go for a brisk walk every day. At 14-year follow-up, there was no substantial change in serum laboratory values, but a lung function test revealed her diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide had decreased to 52%, while her forced vital capacity remained good at 95%; these findings were suggestive of interval development of restrictive lung function.",
        "To assess the morphologic changes of osteoid osteomas on computed tomographic (CT) scans in association with pain duration.Institutional review board approval was obtained. Informed consent was waived. From January 2008 to December 2012, 235 patients were treated with interstitial laser ablation at the H\u00f4pital Lariboisi\u00e8re. Ninety-six patients with histopathologically proven osteoid osteomas, complete clinical files, and CT data were studied retrospectively. The following variables were assessed: age, sex, bone location, bone segment, location of the osteoid osteoma in relation to the native cortex, nidus area, nidus calcification area and attenuation at CT, and nidus mineralization ratio (percentage of the calcification area over the total nidus area). Analysis of variance, Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox multivariate regression model were used for statistical analyses.The study sample consisted of 96 patients, 68 of whom were male (71%) and 28 of whom were female (29%) (ratio of male to female patients, 2.4:1). Mean age \u00b1 standard deviation was 22.2 years \u00b1 10.4 (range, 4-54 years; median, 18.5 years). The patients' age and nidus mineralization ratio increased significantly with pain duration (hazard ratio, 0.975 [P = .031] and 0.193 [P = .007], respectively). No significant association was found between pain duration and other variables, including the nidus area. In long bones, diaphyseal osteoid osteomas were significantly less mineralized than those in other locations (P = .009).The nidus mineralization ratio of osteoid osteomas increases significantly with pain duration and may be a marker of tumor age. Diaphyseal osteoid osteomas demonstrate a lower ratio of nidus mineralization. At the onset of symptoms, older patients experience pain for a longer period before treatment.",
        "Imaging research laboratories are rapidly creating machine learning systems that achieve expert human performance using open-source methods and tools. These artificial intelligence systems are being developed to improve medical image reconstruction, noise reduction, quality assurance, triage, segmentation, computer-aided detection, computer-aided classification, and radiogenomics. In August 2018, a meeting was held in Bethesda, Maryland, at the National Institutes of Health to discuss the current state of the art and knowledge gaps and to develop a roadmap for future research initiatives. Key research priorities include: 1, new image reconstruction methods that efficiently produce images suitable for human interpretation from source data; 2, automated image labeling and annotation methods, including information extraction from the imaging report, electronic phenotyping, and prospective structured image reporting; 3, new machine learning methods for clinical imaging data, such as tailored, pretrained model architectures, and federated machine learning methods; 4, machine learning methods that can explain the advice they provide to human users (so-called explainable artificial intelligence); and 5, validated methods for image de-identification and data sharing to facilitate wide availability of clinical imaging data sets. This research roadmap is intended to identify and prioritize these needs for academic research laboratories, funding agencies, professional societies, and industry.",
        "Background Recent deep learning (DL) approaches have shown promise in improving sensitivity but have not addressed limitations in radiologist specificity or efficiency. Purpose To develop a DL model to triage a portion of mammograms as cancer free, improving performance and workflow efficiency. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, 223 109 consecutive screening mammograms performed in 66 661 women from January 2009 to December 2016 were collected with cancer outcomes obtained through linkage to a regional tumor registry. This cohort was split by patient into 212 272, 25 999, and 26 540 mammograms from 56 831, 7021, and 7176 patients for training, validation, and testing, respectively. A DL model was developed to triage mammograms as cancer free and evaluated on the test set. A DL-triage workflow was simulated in which radiologists skipped mammograms triaged as cancer free (interpreting them as negative for cancer) and read mammograms not triaged as cancer free by using the original interpreting radiologists' assessments. Sensitivities, specificities, and percentage of mammograms read were calculated, with and without the DL-triage-simulated workflow. Statistics were computed across 5000 bootstrap samples to assess confidence intervals (CIs). Specificities were compared by using a two-tailed t test (P < .05) and sensitivities were compared by using a one-sided t test with a noninferiority margin of 5% (P < .05). Results The test set included 7176 women (mean age, 57.8 years \u00b1 10.9 [standard deviation]). When reading all mammograms, radiologists obtained a sensitivity and specificity of 90.6% (173 of 191; 95% CI: 86.6%, 94.7%) and 93.5% (24 625 of 26 349; 95% CI: 93.3%, 93.9%). In the DL-simulated workflow, the radiologists obtained a sensitivity and specificity of 90.1% (172 of 191; 95% CI: 86.0%, 94.3%) and 94.2% (24 814 of 26 349; 95% CI: 94.0%, 94.6%) while reading 80.7% (21 420 of 26 540) of the mammograms. The simulated workflow improved specificity (P = .002) and obtained a noninferior sensitivity with a margin of 5% (P < .001). Conclusion This deep learning model has the potential to reduce radiologist workload and significantly improve specificity without harming sensitivity. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Purpose To compare effectiveness of transarterial ethanol ablation (TEA) and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and determine whether TEA leads to better overall survival and tumor response than TACE. Materials and Methods In this institutional review board\u2013approved preregistered randomized controlled trial (n = 200), informed consent was obtained. Primary outcome was overall survival; secondary outcomes were time to progression (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS), tumor response at computed tomography, and treatment-related toxicity. Eligible patients were randomized at a 1:1 ratio. Treatment included transcatheter delivery of ethiodized oil\u2013ethanol mixture (2:1 ratio by volume up to 60 mL) for TEA and cisplatin\u2013ethiodized oil emulsion (0.5 mg cisplatin per milliliter up to 30 mg), followed by 1-mm gelatin-sponge pellets, for TACE. Study was terminated after interim analysis (n = 98); 90 patients were available for analysis. Overall survival, TTP, and PFS were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier method; differences were compared with log-rank test. Results Study was terminated prematurely after interim analysis, which showed no difference in overall survival; this was unlikely to change with further patient accrual. Median overall survival in TEA and TACE was 24.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 12.8, 32.7) and 20.1 months (95% CI: 9.3, 31.2), respectively (P = .358). Median TTP and PFS for intralesional progression were longer with TEA than TACE (TTP, 34.6 months [95% CI: 28.2, 41] vs 26.05 months [95% CI: 18.7, 33.3]; PFS, 14.8 months [95% CI: 10.2, 19.5] vs 9.3 months [95% CI: 7.1, 11.5]) (P = .028 and 0.029, respectively). Complete response rate on a tumor basis was persistently and significantly higher with TEA at 3 months (62 of 88 [70%] vs 39 of 76 [51%], P = .012), 6 months (64 of 88 [73%] vs 41 of 76 [54%], P = .012), and 12 months (66 of 88 [75%] vs 45 of 76 [59%], P = .031).

        "Purpose To determine whether intravenous low-osmolality iodinated contrast material is associated with post\u2013computed tomography (CT) acute kidney injury (AKI). Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval was obtained and patient consent waived for this HIPAA-compliant retrospective study. CT examinations performed over a 10-year period in adult inpatients with sufficient serum creatinine (SCr) data were identified. A one-to-one propensity-matched matched cohort analysis with multivariate analysis of effects was performed with post-CT AKI as the primary outcome measure (10 121 unenhanced and 10 121 intravenous contrast-enhanced CT examinations in 20 242 patients). Propensity matching was performed with respect to likelihood of patient receiving intravenous contrast material (36 tested covariates). The primary endpoint was post-CT AKI by using Acute Kidney Injury Network SCr criteria; the secondary endpoint was post-CT AKI by using traditional SCr criteria for contrast material\u2013induced nephrotoxicity (CIN; SCr increase \u22650.5 mg/dL [44.20\u03bcmol/L] or \u226525%). Multivariate subgroup threshold analysis was performed (SCr <1.5 [<132.60 \u03bcmol/L]; \u22651.5 to \u22652.0 mg/dL [\u2265132.60 to \u2265176.80 \u03bcmol/L]) and adjusted for assigned propensity scores. Results Intravenous low-osmolality iodinated contrast material had a significant effect on the development of post-CT AKI for patients with pre-CT SCr levels of 1.6 mg/dL (141.44 \u03bcmol/L) or greater (odds ratio, 1.45; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11, 1.89;P = .007). This effect strengthened as pre-CT SCr increased. Patients with stable SCr less than 1.5 mg/dL (132.60 \u03bcmol/L) were not at risk for developing CIN (P = .25, power > 95%). Both endpoints demonstrated similar results (eg, SCr \u22651.6 mg/dL [141.44 \u03bcmol/L] by using traditional CIN criteria: odds ratio, 1.64; 95% CI: 1.18, 2.28; P = .003). Post-CT AKI was prevalent in both the unenhanced and contrast-enhanced CT subgroups, and it increased with increases in pre-CT SCr. Many risk factors contributed to development of post-CT AKI, regardless of iodinated contrast material. Conclusion Intravenous low-osmolality iodinated contrast material is a nephrotoxic risk factor, but not in patients with a stable SCr level less than 1.5 mg/dL. Many factors other than contrast material can affect post-CT AKI rates. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "Purpose To compare biopsy performance of two approaches for multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR)-targeted biopsy (TB) with that of extended systematic biopsy (SB) in prostate cancer (PCa) detection. Materials and Methods This institutional review board\u2013approved multicenter prospective study (May 2009 to January 2011) included 95 patients with informed consent who were suspected of having PCa, with a suspicious abnormality (target) at prebiopsy MR. Patients underwent 12-core SB and four-core TB with transrectal ultrasonographic (US) guidance, with two cores aimed visually (cognitive TB [TB-COG]) and two cores aimed using transrectal US\u2013MR fusion software (fusion-guided TB [TB-FUS]). SB and TB positivity for cancer and sampling quality (mean longest core cancer length, Gleason score) were compared. Clinically significant PCa was any 3 mm or greater core cancer length or any greater than 3 Gleason pattern for SB or any cancer length for TB. Statistical analysis included t test, paired \u03c72 test, and \u03ba statistic. Primary end point (core cancer length) was calculated (paired t test). Results Among 95 patients (median age, 65 years; mean prostate-specific antigen level, 10.05 ng/mL [10.05 \u03bcg/L]), positivity rate for PCa was 59% (n = 56) for SB and 69% (n = 66) for TB (P = .033); rate for clinically significant PCa was 52% (n = 49) for SB and 67% (n = 64) for TB (P = .0011). Cancer was diagnosed through TB in 16 patients (17%) with negative SB results. Mean longest core cancer lengths were 4.6 mm for SB and 7.3 mm for TB (P < .0001). In 12 of 51 (24%) MR imaging targets with positive SB and TB results, TB led to Gleason score upgrading. In 79 MR imaging targets, positivity for cancer was 47% (n = 37) with TB-COG and 53% (n = 42) with TB-FUS (P = .16). Neither technique was superior for Gleason score assessment. Conclusion Prebiopsy MR imaging combined with transrectal US\u2013guided TB increases biopsy performance in detecting PCa, especially clinically significant PCa. No significant difference was observed between TB-FUS and TB-COG for TB guidance. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.13121501/-/DC1",
        "To assess the utility of axial and coronal reformatted multidetector computed tomographic (CT) images in the evaluation of the invasion of posterior hepatic plexuses by extrahepatic bile duct cancer.This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and informed consent was waived. Forty-three patients (22 men, 21 women; age range, 40-80 years; mean age, 65 years) with surgically resected cancer involving the extrahepatic bile duct between December 2004 and September 2010 were included. Posterior hepatic plexus 1 runs from the superior and middle bile duct to the right celiac ganglion, and posterior hepatic plexus 2 runs between the lower bile duct and right celiac ganglion behind the portal vein. Invasion of the posterior hepatic plexuses was elucidated by using pathologic and postoperative multidetector CT findings. Three radiologists independently evaluated the preoperative axial and coronal reformatted images with a separate viewing session for the invasion of posterior hepatic plexuses that was detected on the basis of the presence of increased attenuation of fat tissue along the nerve routes. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to compare the diagnostic performance of the two image interpretations.Invasion of posterior hepatic plexus 1 and of posterior hepatic plexus 2 was recognized in 10 (23%) and nine (21%) of 43 patients, respectively. The diagnostic performance of coronal reformatted image interpretation was significantly greater than that for axial image interpretation (mean area under the curve, 0.99 vs 0.89, P = .04; mean accuracy, 95% vs 82%, P = .003). In all reviewers, one false-positive diagnosis of the invasion of posterior hepatic plexus occurred on axial and/or coronal image display types because of fibrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration along these plexus routes.Coronal reformatted images can be useful for accurate diagnosis of the invasion of posterior hepatic plexuses and may facilitate surgical decision making in regard to the resection of celiac ganglion.",

Materials and Methods This study had institutional review board approval; the requirement for informed consent was waived. Eighty-two patients (58 patients with FNH and 24 patients with HCAs) with 111 lesions were included in the study. There were 74 female patients and eight male patients (mean age, 41.9 years \u00b1 13.2 [standard deviation]; age range, 11\u201378 years). Two readers reviewed all images in terms of signal intensity (SI) features on unenhanced, dynamic, and hepatobiliary phase images. For quantitative analysis, contrast enhancement ratio (CER), lesion-to-liver contrast (LLC), and SI ratio on dynamic and hepatobiliary phase images were calculated. Results The CER of FNH in the arterial phase (mean, 94.3% \u00b1 33.2) was significantly higher than that of HCAs (mean, 59.3% \u00b1 28.1) (P < .0001). During the hepatobiliary phase, the LLC of FNH showed minimally positive values (mean, 0.05 \u00b1 0.01) and that of HCAs demonstrated strong negative values (mean, \u22120.67 \u00b1 0.24) (P < .0001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the hepatobiliary phase SI ratio for differentiation of the two tumors was 0.97, and a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 91% were found with a cutoff value of 0.87. Among six FNH lesions that showed atypical hypointensity during the hepatobiliary phase, four had a large central scar, one contained a substantial fat component, and one had abundant radiating fibrous septa. Three HCAs were isointense during the hepatobiliary phase owing to severe hepatic steatosis.

        "To assess the extent to which multiple Alzheimer disease (AD) biomarkers improve the ability to predict future decline in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) compared with predictions based on clinical parameters alone.All protocols were approved by the institutional review board at each site, and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. The study was HIPAA compliant. Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) baseline magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) studies for 97 subjects with MCI were used. MR imaging-derived gray matter probability maps and FDG PET images were analyzed by using independent component analysis, an unbiased data-driven method to extract independent sources of information from whole-brain data. The loading parameters for all MR imaging and FDG components, along with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins, were entered into logistic regression models (dependent variable: conversion to AD within 4 years). Eight models were considered, including all combinations of MR imaging, PET, and CSF markers with the covariates (age, education, apolipoprotein E genotype, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale score).Combining MR imaging, FDG PET, and CSF data with routine clinical tests significantly increased the accuracy of predicting conversion to AD compared with clinical testing alone. The misclassification rate decreased from 41.3% to 28.4% (P < .00001). FDG PET contributed more information to routine tests (P < .00001) than CSF (P = .32) or MR imaging (P = .08).Imaging and CSF biomarkers can improve prediction of conversion from MCI to AD compared with baseline clinical testing.

One radiologist measured largest diameter and enhancement parameters of each clear cell RCC. Associations between CT features and mutations in VHL, PBRM1, SETD2, KDM5C, and BAP1 genes were tested by using the Fisher exact test. Associations between mutations and size and enhancement were assessed by using the independent t test. Interreader agreement was calculated by using the Fleiss \u03ba. Results Mutation frequencies among clear cell RCCs were as follows: VHL, 53.2% (124 of 233); PBRM1, 28.8% (67 of 233); SETD2, 7.3% (17 of 233); KDM5C, 6.9% (16 of 233); and BAP1, 6.0% (14 of 233). Mutations of VHL were significantly associated with well-defined tumor margins (P = .013), nodular tumor enhancement (P = .021), and gross appearance of intratumoral vascularity (P = .018). Mutations of KDM5C and BAP1 were significantly associated with evidence of renal vein invasion (P = .022 and .046, respectively). The genotype of solid clear cell RCC differed significantly from the genotype of multicystic clear cell RCC. While mutations of SETD2, KDM5C, and BAP1 were absent in multicystic clear cell RCC, mutations of VHL (P = .016) and PBRM1 (P = .017) were significantly more common among solid clear cell RCC. Interreader agreement for CT feature assessments ranged from substantial to excellent (\u03ba = 0.791\u20130.912). Conclusion This preliminary radiogenomics analysis of clear cell RCC revealed associations between CT features and underlying mutations that warrant further investigation and validation. \u00a9RSNA, 2013 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "The purpose of this statement is to describe and define the phenotypic abnormalities that can be identified on visual and quantitative evaluation of computed tomographic (CT) images in subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), with the goal of contributing to a personalized approach to the treatment of patients with COPD. Quantitative CT is useful for identifying and sequentially evaluating the extent of emphysematous lung destruction, changes in airway walls, and expiratory air trapping. However, visual assessment of CT scans remains important to describe patterns of altered lung structure in COPD. The classification system proposed and illustrated in this article provides a structured approach to visual and quantitative assessment of COPD. Emphysema is classified as centrilobular (subclassified as trace, mild, moderate, confluent, and advanced destructive emphysema), panlobular, and paraseptal (subclassified as mild or substantial). Additional important visual features include airway wall thickening, inflammatory small airways disease, tracheal abnormalities, interstitial lung abnormalities, pulmonary arterial enlargement, and bronchiectasis.",
        "To demonstrate coronary sinus-left atrium connections and evaluate coronary sinus function and anatomy in detail by using multidetector computed tomography (CT).In this institutional review board-approved retrospective study, the authors evaluated coronary CT angiograms obtained in 65 patients with normal sinus rhythm (normal group) and seven with atrial fibrillation at CT (atrial fibrillation group). Coronary sinus-right atrium muscle continuity was indirectly evaluated by measuring the length of the coronary sinus contraction during atrial systole. The length, number, and extent of coronary sinus-left atrium connections were recorded. The accuracy of CT was validated by comparing microscopic images of autopsied hearts with corresponding CT images. Comparisons were performed by using Student t tests for continuous variables. P \u2264 .05 was considered indicative of a statistically significant difference.In the normal group, coronary sinus contraction was seen in 60 of the 65 patients (92%, mean length \u00b1 standard deviation, 25.7 mm \u00b1 8.0). The coronary sinus narrowed 26% from middiastole to atrial systole (P < .0001). Coronary sinus-left atrium muscle connections were seen in 58 of the 65 patients (89%). A single connection was seen in 43 of the 65 patients (66%), with a mean length of 21.0 mm \u00b1 14.0 within 12.0 mm \u00b1 11.0 of the coronary sinus ostium. In 10 of the 43 patients (26%) with single connections, the connection extended to the coronary sinus ostium. In 10 of the 65 patients (15%), the entire coronary sinus was attached to the left atrial wall. Fifteen patients (23%) had two connections; distal connections measured 9 mm \u00b1 2.4 in length within 2.2 mm \u00b1 3.8 of the coronary sinus ostium, and proximal connections measured 15.4 mm \u00b1 10.0 in length within 24.0 mm \u00b1 8.0 of the coronary sinus ostium. In seven patients (11%), no coronary sinus-left atrium connection was seen; however, all showed a coronary sinus constriction during atrial systole, indicating that coronary sinus-right atrium muscle continuity is likely the primary cause for coronary sinus contractions. In the atrial fibrillation group, no coronary sinus contraction was seen. All images in the atrial fibrillation group showed a coronary sinus-left atrium connection, which was single in five patients and double in two. The area of the coronary sinus during diastole was larger in the atrial fibrillation group than in the normal group (114 mm(2) \u00b1 37 vs 77 mm(2) \u00b1 40, respectively; P = .02).CT can provide excellent information about coronary sinus function and coronary sinus-left atrium muscle connections.",
        "Background Deep learning (DL)-based MRI reconstructions can reduce examination times for turbo spin-echo (TSE) acquisitions. Studies that prospectively employ DL-based reconstructions of rapidly acquired, undersampled spine MRI are needed. Purpose To investigate the diagnostic interchangeability of an unrolled DL-reconstructed TSE (hereafter, TSEDL) T1- and T2-weighted acquisition method with standard TSE and to test their impact on acquisition time, image quality, and diagnostic confidence. Materials and Methods This prospective single-center study included participants with various spinal abnormalities who gave written consent from November 2020 to July 2021. Each participant underwent two MRI examinations: standard fully sampled T1- and T2-weighted TSE acquisitions (reference standard) and prospectively undersampled TSEDL acquisitions with threefold and fourfold acceleration. Image evaluation was performed by five readers. Interchangeability analysis and an image quality-based analysis were used to compare the TSE and TSEDL images. Acquisition time and diagnostic confidence were also compared. Interchangeability was tested using the individual equivalence index regarding various degenerative and nondegenerative entities, which were analyzed on each vertebra and defined as discordant clinical judgments of less than 5%. Interreader and intrareader agreement and concordance (\u03ba and Kendall \u03c4 and W statistics) were computed and Wilcoxon and McNemar tests were used. Results Overall, 50 participants were evaluated (mean age, 46 years \u00b1 18 [SD]; 26 men). The TSEDL method enabled up to a 70% reduction in total acquisition time (100 seconds for TSEDL vs 328 seconds for TSE, P < .001). All individual equivalence indexes were less than 4%. TSEDL acquisition was rated as having superior image noise by all readers (P < .001). No evidence of a difference was found between standard TSE and TSEDL regarding frequency of major findings, overall image quality, or diagnostic confidence. Conclusion The deep learning (DL)-reconstructed turbo spin-echo (TSE) method was found to be interchangeable with standard TSE for detecting various abnormalities of the spine at MRI. DL-reconstructed TSE acquisition provided excellent image quality, with a 70% reduction in examination time. German Clinical Trials Register no.

        "Purpose To assess the prevalence and number of cortical microinfarcts in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) by using a 7-T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging system, to assess the independent association of cortical microinfarcts with cognitive dysfunction, and to investigate potential confounding effects of the coexisting presence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Materials and Methods The local institutional review board approved this study. In all cases, informed consent was obtained. High-spatial-resolution fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and T2*-weighted images were acquired in 14 AD patients and 18 control subjects to assess the presence of microinfarcts and microbleeds. Presence of CAA was assessed according to the Boston criteria. Image analysis was performed independently by two reviewers. Mann-Whitney U test was performed to assess differences in number of microinfarcts between groups. Negative binomial regression models were used to assess the association between diagnosis of AD and diagnosis of CAA and number of microinfarcts, between diagnosis of AD and number of microbleeds and number of microinfarcts, and between cognitive function and number of microinfarcts, all corrected for age and sex. Results Interobserver agreement was excellent for detecting microinfarcts (\u03ba = 0.91) (P < .001). Patients with AD demonstrated higher number (P = .005) of microinfarcts (mean, 7.2) compared with control subjects (mean, 1.8). Negative binomial regression models showed an independent association between AD and number of microinfarcts (P = .006) and a trend for CAA and microinfarcts (P = .052). A negative correlation was found between cognitive function and the number of microinfarcts (P = .009). Conclusion Patients with AD show more microinfarcts than do control subjects, the number of microinfarcts correlates with global cognitive performance, and the presence of microinfarcts was mainly AD rather than CAA related. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "Purpose To study T1 baseline signal intensity (SI) and contrast material enhancement kinetics of normal breast parenchyma by using dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance (MR) mammography and to determine the influence of anthropometric measures and menopausal status on the variability of these features. Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval and written informed consent were obtained. Between June 2008 and September 2011, 345 women (age range, 26\u201381 years; mean age, 51.3 years \u00b1 11.6 [standard deviation]) underwent DCE MR mammography, with T1-weighted three-dimensional MR images (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 8.86/4.51; flip angle, 25\u00b0) acquired with a 1.5-T whole-body MR unit before and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 minutes after a gadobutrol bolus injection of 0.1 mmol per kilogram of body weight. Regions of interest were traced manually, and T1 SI of parenchyma was recorded. The influence of different predictors of T1 baseline SI and contrast enhancement was studied by using random-effects models. Results T1 baseline SI varied considerably between women, with a mean of 167.7 \u00b1 49.2 (71.4\u2013424.7 [range]) and 175.9 \u00b1 48.9 (51.8\u2013458.3) in the right and the left breast, respectively (P < .01). T1 baseline SI increased linearly with age (P < .0001) and body weight (P < .0001). After contrast material delivery, relative percentage of enhancement was 8.1%, 13.8%, 18.2%, 22.1%, and 24.6% at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 minutes, respectively, but varied considerably between women. Contrast enhancement was 9.3% in the lowest quintile and 47.4% in the highest. Contrast enhancement increased with body weight (P < .01) but decreased in postmenopausal women (P < .01). Women with higher baseline T1 SI tended to have a higher contrast enhancement slope. Conclusion Anthropometric measures and menopausal status contribute to a large variability in contrast enhancement of normal breast parenchyma. This might influence the interpretation of contrast enhancement kinetics of breast lesions and current strategies for determining contrast medium dose for breast MR imaging. \u00a9 RSNA, 2012",
        "To investigate the correlation between magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings and pathologic subtype classification of hepatocellular adenoma (HCA).This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and the requirement for informed consent was waived. MR imaging studies of 61 lesions (48 patients; median age, 36 years) were available and were independently reviewed by two radiologists. Consensus readings on all morphologic and signal-intensity imaging features were obtained. Previously, these lesions had been classified on the basis of pathologic findings and immunohistochemical analysis. Fisher exact and \u03c7\u00b2 tests were performed to compare the results between the different subtypes. A Bonferroni correction was applied to correct for multiple testing (\u03b1 < .0033).MR imaging signs of diffuse intratumoral fat deposition were present in seven (78%) of nine liver-fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP)-negative HCAs compared with five (17%) of 29 inflammatory HCAs (P = .001). Steatosis within the nontumoral liver was present in 11 (38%) of 29 inflammatory HCAs compared with none of the L-FABP-negative HCAs (P = .038). A characteristic atoll sign was only seen in the inflammatory group (P = .027). Presence of a typical vaguely defined type of scar was seen in five (71%) of seven \u03b2-catenin-positive HCAs (P = .003). No specific MR imaging features were identified for the unclassified cases.L-FABP-negative, inflammatory, and \u03b2-catenin-positive HCAs were related to MR imaging signs of diffuse intratumoral fat deposition, an atoll sign, and a typical vaguely defined scar, respectively. Since \u03b2-catenin-positive HCAs are considered premalignant, closer follow-up with MR imaging or resection may be preferred.",
        "Background In multiple sclerosis (MS), gray matter (GM) atrophy exhibits a specific pattern, which correlates strongly with clinical disability. However, the mechanism of regional specificity in GM atrophy remains largely unknown. Recently, the network degeneration hypothesis (NDH) was quantitatively defined (using coordinate-based meta-analysis) as the atrophy-based functional network (AFN) model, which posits that localized GM atrophy in MS is mediated by functional networks. Purpose To test the NDH in MS in a data-driven manner using the AFN model to direct analyses in an independent test sample. Materials and Methods Model fit testing was conducted with structural equation modeling, which is based on the computation of semipartial correlations. Model verification was performed in coordinate-based data of healthy control participants from the BrainMap database (https://www.brainmap.org). Model validation was conducted in prospectively acquired resting-state functional MRI in participants with relapsing-remitting MS who were recruited between September 2018 and January 2019. Correlation analyses of model fit indices and volumetric measures with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores and disease duration were performed. Results Model verification of healthy control participants included 80 194 coordinates from 9035 experiments. Model verification in healthy control data resulted in excellent model fit (root mean square error of approximation, 0.037; 90% CI: 0.036, 0.039). Twenty participants (mean age, 36 years \u00b1 9 [standard deviation]; 12 women) with relapsing-remitting MS were evaluated. Model validation in resting-state functional MRI in participants with MS resulted in deviation from optimal model fit (root mean square error of approximation, 0.071; 90% CI: 0.070, 0.072), which correlated with EDSS scores (r = 0.68; P = .002). Conclusion The atrophy-based functional network model predicts functional network disruption in multiple sclerosis (MS), thereby supporting the network degeneration hypothesis. On resting-state functional MRI scans, reduced functional network integrity in participants with MS had a strong positive correlation with clinical disability. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Background Although previous studies have focused on rural disparities in the use of screening mammography, city-level use throughout the United States has not been well evaluated even though more than 30 million women live in the 500 largest cities. Purpose To evaluate disparities in the city-level use of screening mammography and to identify factors that have an impact on screening utilization. Materials and Methods This retrospective study used data from large publicly available databases, the American Community Survey and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation 500 Cities Project, which includes screening mammography utilization data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Databases were searched from January to March 2018. The use of screening mammography was evaluated at the city level by census region and division by using the Mann-Whitney U test. Univariable Spearman rank correlation and multivariable regression analysis were performed to determine the impact of factors on screening use, including population size, health-related variables (use of Papanicolaou test, obesity), income variables (median household income, poverty status, health insurance), and race. Results Overall mean city-level screening mammography use rate was 77.7% (range, 62.8%-88.9%). The highest mean utilization occurred in coastal cities, with the highest overall utilization in the New England area (82.7%). The lowest utilization rate was in Mountain states (73.6%). City-level utilization showed a positive correlation with Papanicolaou test use (r = 0.75, P < .001), median household income (r = 0.44, P < .001), and percentage Asian population (r = 0.38, P < .001) and a negative correlation with obesity (r = -0.36, P < .001), the lack of health insurance (r = -0.44, P < .001), and poverty (r = -0.30, P < .001). Multivariable analysis showed the strongest independent predictors of utilization to be percentage of women screened with the Papanicolaou test, Asian race, private insurance, and census division (R2 = 68%). Conclusion Disparities in the utilization of preventive health care services exist at the large city level, with the highest use in New England cities and lowest in Mountain cities. Predictors of higher than average utilization include census division and percentage of inhabitants who are up to date with the Papanicolaou test, are of Asian race, and have private insurance. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019.",

        "To explore whether arterial spin labeling (ASL) imaging in cognitively intact elderly individuals may be used to predict subsequent early neuropsychological decline.The local ethics committee approved this prospective study, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. A total of 148 consecutive control subjects were included, 75 of whom had stable cognitive function (sCON) (mean age, 75.9 years \u00b1 3.4 [standard deviation]; 43 female) and 73 of whom had deteriorated cognitive function (dCON) at 18-month clinical follow-up (mean age, 76.8 years \u00b1 4.1; 44 female). An additional 65 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (mean age, 76.2 years \u00b1 6.1; 25 female) were also included. Two-dimensional pulsed ASL was performed at the baseline visit. Statistical analysis included whole-brain voxelwise analysis of the ASL relative cerebral blood flow (CBF) data, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and voxel-based morphometry analysis of gray matter.The voxelwise comparison of ASL revealed decreased relative CBF in the dCON group compared with that in the sCON group and slightly more pronounced relative CBF in the MCI group compared with that in the sCON group, most notably in the PCC (P < .05 corrected). Comparison of the dCON group with the MCI group revealed no significant differences. ROC analysis of relative CBF in the PCC enabled discrimination of dCON (P < .001; area under the ROC curve, 0.66). There was no confounding focal gray matter atrophy.Reduced ASL in the PCC at baseline is associated with the development of subsequent subtle neuropsychological deficits in healthy elderly control subjects. At a group level, ASL patterns in subjects with dCON are similar to those in patients with MCI at baseline, indicating that these subjects may initially maintain their cognitive status via mobilization of their neurocognitive reserve at baseline; however, they are likely to develop subsequent subtle cognitive deficits.",
        "Purpose To define thresholds for detecting significant change in liver viscoelasticity with magnetic resonance (MR) elastography, both for whole-liver measurements and for voxel-wise measurements in relation to spatial resolution. Materials and Methods This prospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and all participants provided written informed consent. Thirty participants (16 volunteers and 14 patients with hepatitis B or C; 18 men; median age, 30.4 years; age range, 18.9\u201358.6 years) underwent imaging twice while in the same position (intraimage reproducibility), after repositioning (within-day reproducibility), and 1\u20134 weeks later (between-weeks reproducibility). MR elastography parameters comprised elasticity, viscosity, attenuation parameter \u03b1, and propagation parameter \u03b2. Bland-Altman analysis was used to calculate repeatability indexes for each parameter. Analyses were performed in a region-of-interest and a voxel-by-voxel level. Voxel-wise results were calculated in relation to spatial resolution by applying Gaussian filtering to establish the optimal trade-off point between resolution and reproducibility. Results For elasticity, \u03b1, and \u03b2, within-day and between-weeks results were significantly lower than intraimage results (P \u2264 .018 for all). Within-day and between-weeks results did not differ significantly. Over-time changes of more than 22.2% for elasticity, 26.3% for viscosity, 26.8% for \u03b1, and 10.1% for \u03b2 represented thresholds for significant change. The optimal trade-off between spatial resolution and reproducibility was found at a filter size of 8-mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) for elasticity and propagation parameter \u03b2 and at 16-mm FWHM for viscosity and attenuation parameter \u03b1. Conclusion Repositioning causes a significant decrease in the reproducibility of MR elastography. The propagation parameter \u03b2 is the most reliable parameter, with an over-time threshold for significant change of 10.1% and the ability to reproduce viscoelasticity up to a resolution of 8-mm FWHM. \u00a9RSNA, 2013 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To determine whether hyperpolarized helium 3 magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to measure alveolar partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) shows sufficient test-retest repeatability and between-cohort differences to be used as a reliable technique for detection of alterations in gas exchange in asymptomatic smokers. Materials and Methods The protocol was approved by the local institutional review board and was HIPAA compliant. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Two sets of MR images were obtained 10 minutes apart in 25 subjects: 10 nonsmokers (five men, five women; mean \u00b1 standard deviation age, 50 years \u00b1 6) and 15 smokers (seven women, eight men; mean age, 50 years \u00b1 8). A mixed-effects model was developed to identify the regional repeatability of Pao2 measurements as an intraclass correlation coefficient. Ten smokers were matched with the 10 nonsmokers on the basis of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Three separate models were generated: one for nonsmokers, one for the SNR-matched smokers, and one for the five remaining smokers, who were imaged with a significantly higher SNR. Results Short-term back-to-back regional reproducibility was assessed by using intraclass correlation coefficients, which were 0.67 and 0.65 for SNR case-matched nonsmokers and smokers, respectively. Repeatability was a strong function of SNR; a 50% increase in SNR in the remaining smokers improved the intraclass correlation coefficient to 0.82. Although repeatability was not significantly different between the SNR-matched cohorts (P = .44), the smoker group showed higher spatial and temporal variability in Pao2. Conclusion The short-term test-retest repeatability of hyperpolarized gas MR imaging of regional Pao2 was good. Asymptomatic smokers exhibited greater spatial and temporal variability in Pao2 than did the nonsmokers, which suggests that this parameter allows detection of small functional alterations associated with smoking. \u00a9 RSNA, 2015 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",

        "To evaluate the presence of linear intrathrombus enhancement in coronary total occlusion (CTO) lesions observed at coronary computed tomographic (CT) angiography and its correlation with the outcome of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).All patients gave written informed consent, and the study protocol was approved by the hospital ethics committee. Consecutive patients with CTO confirmed at initial conventional coronary angiography were prospectively chosen to undergo a coronary CT angiography examination prior to their staged PCI. Linear intrathrombus enhancement was defined as a linear area of enhanced opacity traversing the nonopacified occluded segment with attenuation higher than 120 HU. Angiographic features, including lesion length, linear intrathrombus enhancement length, and calcification score, were measured at coronary CT angiography. Univariate and multivariate statistical tests were performed to identify variables associated with successful PCI.Eighty patients with 88 CTO lesions were included in this study. Fifty-one lesions were successfully recanalized at PCI. Lesion length was longer in the PCI failure group (P = .043). Linear intrathrombus enhancement was observed in 30 (59%) of the 51 lesions successfully treated with PCI. However, linear enhancement was found in seven (19%) of 37 patients with failed PCI (P < .001 as compared with patients with successful PCI). Tortuous course was revealed to be the only angiographic parameter associated with unfavorable PCI outcome (P = .008). The presence of linear intrathrombus enhancement proved at multivariate analysis to be the only independent predictor of PCI success (odds ratio: 4.926; 95% confidence interval: 1.646, 14.74; P = .004).The presence of coronary CT angiography-visible linear intrathrombus enhancement within the occluded segment predicts better outcome of PCI in CTOs.",

Three hundred seventy-two patients with HCC were treated between January 1999 and December 2009. Patients with advanced HCC according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging classification (Child-Pugh class A or B, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1-2, and/or macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic metastasis) were included in the study (n = 97). Thirty-four patients underwent conventional TACE with doxorubicin plus lipiodol or TACE with drug-eluting beads; 63 patients were treated with sorafenib.The median duration of sorafenib treatment was 4.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.2, 6.0 months). The median number of TACE sessions per patient was 3 \u00b1 2. Side effects of TACE and sorafenib were comparable to those reported in the literature. The median time to progression was similar between the two treatment groups (P = .737). The median overall survival was 9.2 months (95% CI: 6.1, 12.3 months) for patients treated with TACE and 7.4 months (95% CI: 5.6, 9.2 months) for those treated with sorafenib (P = .377). Only Child-Pugh class was associated with a better overall survival at uni- and multivariate analysis.TACE achieved a promising outcome in select patients with advanced HCC (BCLC stage C).",
        "Purpose To validate the dominant pulse sequence paradigm and limited role of dynamic contrast material\u2013enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 2 for prostate multiparametric MR imaging by using data from a multireader study. Materials and Methods This HIPAA-compliant retrospective interpretation of prospectively acquired data was approved by the local ethics committee. Patients were treatment-na\u00efve with endorectal coil 3-T multiparametric MR imaging. A total of 163 patients were evaluated, 110 with prostatectomy after multiparametric MR imaging and 53 with negative multiparametric MR imaging and systematic biopsy findings. Nine radiologists participated in this study and interpreted images in 58 patients, on average (range, 56\u201360 patients). Lesions were detected with PI-RADS version 2 and were compared with whole-mount prostatectomy findings. Probability of cancer detection for overall, T2-weighted, and diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging PI-RADS scores was calculated in the peripheral zone (PZ) and transition zone (TZ) by using generalized estimating equations. To determine dominant pulse sequence and benefit of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging, odds ratios (ORs) were calculated as the ratio of odds of cancer of two consecutive scores by logistic regression. Results A total of 654 lesions (420 in the PZ) were detected. The probability of cancer detection for PI-RADS category 2, 3, 4, and 5 lesions was 15.7%, 33.1%, 70.5%, and 90.7%, respectively. DW imaging outperformed T2-weighted imaging in the PZ (OR, 3.49 vs 2.45; P = .008). T2-weighted imaging performed better but did not clearly outperform DW imaging in the TZ (OR, 4.79 vs 3.77; P = .494). Lesions classified as PI-RADS category 3 at DW MR imaging and as positive at DCE imaging in the PZ showed a higher probability of cancer detection than did DCE-negative PI-RADS category 3 lesions (67.8% vs 40.0%, P = .02). The addition of DCE imaging to DW imaging in the PZ was beneficial (OR, 2.0; P = .027), with an increase in the probability of cancer detection of 15.7%, 16.0%, and 9.2% for PI-RADS category 2, 3, and 4 lesions, respectively. Conclusion DW imaging outperforms T2-weighted imaging in the PZ; T2-weighted imaging did not show a significant difference when compared with DW imaging in the TZ by PI-RADS version 2 criteria. The addition of DCE imaging to DW imaging scores in the PZ yields meaningful improvements in probability of cancer detection. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 An earlier incorrect version of this article appeared online.

        "History A 38-year-old man who had been in a motor vehicle collision was referred to our institute. He was suspected of having left-sided pneumothorax. This necessitated intercostal drainage with a chest tube, which had been placed elsewhere prior to his arrival. Paraparesis was noted on the initial clinical examination, with adequately maintained vital signs, while the blood work-up revealed a mildly reduced hemoglobin level of 10.1 mg/dL (normal range, 13.8-17.2 mg/dL); however, the rest of the laboratory values were within normal limits (Figs 1-5). The patient was then immediately referred for further evaluation with CT of the brain, cervical spine, and thorax. Thereafter, serial chest radiography was performed for follow-up.",
        "Purpose To study the relationship between functional independence and time to reperfusion in the Solitaire with the Intention for Thrombectomy as Primary Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke (SWIFT PRIME) trial in patients with disabling acute ischemic stroke who underwent endovascular therapy plus intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) administration versus tPA administration alone and to investigate variables that affect time spent during discrete steps. Materials and Methods Data were analyzed from the SWIFT PRIME trial, a global, multicenter, prospective study in which outcomes were compared in patients treated with intravenous tPA alone or in combination with the Solitaire device (Covidien, Irvine, Calif). Between December 2012 and November 2014, 196 patients were enrolled. The relation between time from (a) symptom onset to reperfusion and (b) imaging to reperfusion and clinical outcome was analyzed, along with patient and health system characteristics that affect discrete steps in patient workflow. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess relationships between time and outcome; negative binomial regression was used to evaluate effects on workflow. The institutional review board at each site approved the trial. Patients provided written informed consent, or, at select sites, there was an exception from having to acquire explicit informed consent in emergency circumstances. Results In the stent retriever arm of the study, symptom onset to reperfusion time of 150 minutes led to 91% estimated probability of functional independence, which decreased by 10% over the next hour and by 20% with every subsequent hour of delay. Time from arrival at the emergency department to arterial access was 90 minutes (interquartile range, 69\u2013120 minutes), and time to reperfusion was 129 minutes (interquartile range, 108\u2013169 minutes). Patients who initially arrived at a referring facility had longer symptom onset to groin puncture times compared with patients who presented directly to the endovascular-capable center (275 vs 179.5 minutes, P < .001). Conclusion Fast reperfusion leads to improved functional outcome among patients with acute stroke treated with stent retrievers. Detailed attention to workflow with iterative feedback and aggressive time goals may have contributed to efficient workflow environments. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To compare the diagnostic performance of ultrasonography (US)-based fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) criteria from seven international societies in the detection of thyroid malignancy. Materials and Methods This study included a total of 2000 consecutive thyroid nodules (\u22651 cm) in 1802 patients with final diagnoses from January 2010 to May 2011. US features of the thyroid nodules were retrospectively reviewed and were classified according to the categories defined by the seven international society guidelines. The diagnostic performance of US-based FNAB criteria in the detection of thyroid malignancy and unnecessary FNAB rates were calculated and compared by using a generalized estimating equation method. Results Of the 2000 thyroid nodules, 1546 (78.3%) were benign and 454 (22.7%) were malignant, with papillary carcinoma comprising 85.5% of all malignancies. The Korean Thyroid Association/Korean Society of Thyroid Radiology (KTA/KSThR) (94.5%), National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) (92.5%), and American Thyroid Association (ATA) (89.6%) guidelines were more sensitive than those of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology/Associazione Medici Endocrinologi (AACE/ACE/AME) (80.4%), American College of Radiology (ACR) (74.7%), French Society of Endocrinology (FSE) (72.7%), and Society of Radiology in Ultrasound (SRU) (70.9%) (P < .001), while the latter guidelines had higher specificity (P < .001). The rate of unnecessary FNAB was lowest with the ACR guidelines (25.3%), followed by the FSE (29.1%), AACE/ACE/AME (32.5%), SRU (45.2%), ATA (51.7%), NCCN (54.0%), and KTA/KSThR (56.9%) guidelines. Conclusion Because the diagnostic performance of US-based FNAB criteria varies according to the individual international society guidelines, clinicians should be aware of the strengths and weaknesses of US-based FNAB criteria in the management of thyroid nodules. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To estimate the relative yield of therapeutic flexible sigmoidoscopy compared with complete optical colonoscopy for isolated left-sided polyps (\u22656 mm in diameter) identified at screening computed tomographic (CT) colonography. Materials and Methods This retrospective institutional review board\u2013approved and HIPAA-compliant study included a review of CT colonographic screening results in 6570 consecutive asymptomatic adults (3551 women, 3019 men; mean age, 56.8 years \u00b1 7.3 [standard deviation]). Of 887 (13.5%) patients with cases positive for nondiminutive polyps (\u22656 mm), a subset of 171 patients met the inclusion criteria (a) of having left-sided\u2013only lesions of 6 mm or larger identified at CT colonography (rectum-to-splenic flexure) and (b) of undergoing subsequent evaluation with complete optical colonoscopy. CT colonography\u2013optical colonoscopy concordance and proximal-versus-distal diagnostic yield at optical colonoscopy were assessed. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for relevant results. Results From the study group of 171 patients, a total of 234 left-sided lesions of 6 mm or larger were prospectively reported at CT colonography, of which 222 (94.9%; 95% CI: 91.3%, 97.0%) were confirmed as true-positive findings at optical colonoscopy. With optical colonoscopy, an additional 17 benign left-sided polyps of 6 mm or larger (13 small, four large) were found in 11 patients, resulting in a total left-sided yield of 239 nondiminutive lesions, including 137 small polyps (6\u20139 mm) and 102 large lesions (\u226510 mm), 160 neoplasms, 82 advanced adenomas, and seven cancers. Evaluation of the colon proximal to the splenic flexure in this cohort yielded eight small and two large benign polyps in nine patients but no proximal cancers or histologically advanced lesions. Conclusion For patients with left-sided\u2013only polyps detected at CT colonography, the additional yield of complete optical colonoscopy beyond the expected reach of flexible sigmoidoscopy is very low and may not justify the added costs, potential risks, and procedural time. \u00a9 RSNA, 2011",
        "Purpose To evaluate the safety and efficacy of microwave ablation (MWA) in patients with end-stage renal disease and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Materials and Methods The study protocol was approved by the human ethics review committee. Between March 1, 2014, and June 30, 2015, 51 patients (25 men, 26 women; mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 53.1 years \u00b1 12.9) were enrolled. All patients had at least one enlarged parathyroid gland and secondary symptomatic hyperparathyroidism, which was treated with ultrasonographically (US) guided MWA. The levels of intact parathyroid hormone, serum calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase were compared before and after MWA. Paired-sample t tests and paired-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare treatment outcomes before and after MWA. Results Complete ablation was achieved in all 96 glands in 51 of 120 patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism. The mean follow-up time was 11.1 months \u00b1 3.3. The maximum diameter of the glands ranged from 0.5 cm to 4.8 cm (mean, 1.5 cm \u00b1 0.6). The ablation time for each gland was 216.1 seconds \u00b1 130.1. The mean serum intact parathyroid hormone, calcium, and phosphorus levels after MWA (400 pg/mL [400 ng/L; range, 151.3\u2013629.0 ng/L], 2.33 mmol/L \u00b1 0.23, and 1.54 mmol/L \u00b1 0.43, respectively) were significantly lower than those before MWA (1203 pg/mL [1203 ng/L; range, 854.7\u20131694.5 ng/L], 2.53 mmol/L \u00b1 0.24, and 1.97 mmol/L \u00b1 0.50, respectively; P < .01), while the alkaline phosphatase levels did not change with MWA (P > .05). Ipsilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve injury was seen in one patient (2%). A hematoma developed during one procedure in one patient (2%) and was treated successfully with injection of thrombin. Conclusion US-guided MWA is safe and effective for destroying parathyroid gland tissue in patients with end-stage renal disease and severe secondary hyperparathyroidism. Further experience with the technique is clearly necessary. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016",
        "History An 8-year-old girl presented to our hospital with painful swelling of the left thigh and soft-tissue swelling in the right chest wall. The patient\u2019s history revealed that the swelling had been present since birth but had grown slowly. She had no history of relevant trauma. Her blood pressure was 145/95 mmHg (normal value, <115/76 mmHg), and her heart rate was 105 beats per minute (normal value, 75\u2013118 beats per minute). The patient\u2019s electrocardiogram displayed sinus tachycardia. Physical examination revealed soft-tissue hypertrophy in the left thigh and right lower chest wall. A painful soft and flexible mass measuring approximately 5 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 15 cm (in the anteroposterior, transverse, and craniocaudal directions, respectively) was detected at the left thigh. Moreover, a painless soft mass measuring approximately 3 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 10 cm (in the anteroposterior, transverse, and craniocaudal directions, respectively) was detected in the right lower chest wall, and the overlying skin was intact. Pink macules with a 3-cm diameter on the anterior left superior thigh and a 2.5-cm diameter in the left inguinal region were detected. Examination of other systems, including the cardiovascular system, revealed normal findings. Laboratory test results were within normal limits. Abdominal US showed perirenal vascular collaterals, and musculoskeletal US of the left thigh revealed vascular collaterals (images not shown). Therefore, thoracoabdominal CT angiography (Fig 1a\u20131c) and contrast material\u2013enhanced MRI of the bilateral thigh (Fig 2a\u20132c) were performed.",
        "Purpose To determine whether quantitative MRI relaxation time mapping techniques can help to detect ischemic injury to the developing femoral head. Materials and Methods For this prospective animal study conducted from November 2015 to February 2018, 10 male 6-week-old piglets underwent an operation to induce complete right femoral head ischemia. Animals were humanely killed at 48 hours (n = 2) or 4 weeks (n = 8) after the operation, and the operated and contralateral-control femoral heads were harvested and frozen. Thawed specimens were imaged at 9.4-T MRI by using T1, T2, T1 in the rotating frame (T1\u03c1), adiabatic T1\u03c1, relaxation along a fictitious field (RAFF), and T2* mapping and evaluated with histologic analysis. Paired relaxation time differences between the operated and control femoral heads were measured in the secondary ossification center (SOC), epiphyseal cartilage, articular cartilage, and metaphysis and were analyzed by using a paired t test. Results In the SOC, T1\u03c1 and RAFF had the greatest percent increases in the operated versus control femoral heads at both 48 hours (112% and 72%, respectively) and 4 weeks (74% and 70%, respectively). In the epiphyseal and articular cartilage, T2, T1\u03c1, and RAFF were similarly increased at both points (range, 24%-49%). At 4 weeks, T2, T1\u03c1, adiabatic T1\u03c1, and RAFF were increased in the SOC (P = .004, .018, < .001, and .001, respectively), epiphyseal cartilage (P = .009, .008, .011, and .007, respectively), and articular cartilage (P = .005, .016, .033, and .018, respectively). Histologic assessment identified necrosis in SOC and deep layer of the epiphyseal cartilage at both points. Conclusion T2, T1 in the rotating frame, adiabatic T1 in the rotating frame, and relaxation along a fictitious field maps are sensitive in helping to detect ischemic injury to the developing femoral head. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",

        "To use coronary computed tomographic (CT) angiography to compare the prevalence, extent, and composition of coronary atherosclerotic lesions in African American and white patients with acute chest pain.The institutional review board waived the requirement for informed consent for this retrospective, HIPAA-compliant matched-cohort study. The authors analyzed the CT angiographic data of 301 patients (150 consecutive African American patients; 151 white control patients; mean age, 55 years \u00b1 11 [standard deviation]; 33% male) with acute chest pain. Each coronary artery segment was evaluated for presence of atherosclerotic plaque, plaque composition (calcified, noncalcified, or mixed), and stenosis. In addition, the noncalcified plaque volume was quantified by using a threshold-based automated algorithm. The presence and extent of atherosclerotic plaque were compared between the groups by using univariate and multivariate regression analyses.While there was no significant difference between the African American and white patients with respect to presence of any plaque (118 [79%] of 150 vs 112 [74%] of 151 patients, respectively; P = .36) or presence of stenosis (26 [17%] vs 37 [24%] patients, respectively; P = .13), the African American patients had a significantly higher prevalence (96 [64%] vs 62 [41%] patients, respectively; P < .001) and volume (median volume, 2.2 vs 1.4 mL, respectively; P < .001) of noncalcified plaque, independent of diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors (odds ratio, 2.45; 95% confidence interval: 1.52, 4.04). In contrast, the African American patients had a lower prevalence of calcified plaque (39 [26%] vs 68 [45%] white patients, P = .001).Study results suggest that atherosclerotic plaque burden and composition, as measured by using coronary CT angiography, differ between African American and white patients, with relatively more noncalcified disease in African Americans and more calcified disease in white individuals. Further research is warranted to determine whether CT plaque characterization can improve cardiac risk prediction in African Americans.",
        "To compare the diagnostic yields of a radiologist and trained technologists in the detection of advanced neoplasia within a population-based computed tomographic (CT) colonography screening program.Ethical approval was obtained from the Dutch Health Council, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Nine hundred eighty-two participants (507 men, 475 women) underwent low-dose CT colonography after noncathartic bowel preparation (iodine tagging) between July 13, 2009, and January 21, 2011. Each scan was evaluated by one of three experienced radiologists (\u2265800 examinations) by using primary two-dimensional (2D) reading followed by secondary computer-aided detection (CAD) and by two of four trained technologists (\u2265200 examinations, with colonoscopic verification) by using primary 2D reading followed by three-dimensional analysis and CAD. Immediate colonoscopy was recommended for participants with lesions measuring at least 10 mm, and surveillance was recommended for participants with lesions measuring 6-9 mm. Consensus between technologists was achieved in case of discordant recommendations. Detection of advanced neoplasia (classified by a pathologist) was defined as a true-positive (TP) finding. Relative TP and false-positive (FP) fractions were calculated along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Overall, 96 of the 982 participants were referred for colonoscopy and 104 were scheduled for surveillance. Sixty of 84 participants (71%) referred for colonoscopy by the radiologist had advanced neoplasia, compared with 55 of 64 participants (86%) referred by two technologists. Both the radiologist and technologists detected all colorectal cancers (n = 5). The relative TP fraction (for technologists vs radiologist) for advanced neoplasia was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.78, 1.07), and the relative FP fraction was 0.38 (95% CI: 0.21, 0.67).Two technologists serving as a primary reader of CT colonographic images can achieve a comparable sensitivity to that of a radiologist for the detection of advanced neoplasia, with far fewer FP referrals for colonoscopy.",
        "To compare radiologists' diagnostic accuracy and recall rates for breast tomosynthesis combined with digital mammography versus digital mammography alone.Institutional review board approval was obtained at each accruing institution. Participating women gave written informed consent. Mediolateral oblique and craniocaudal digital mammographic and tomosynthesis images of both breasts were obtained from 1192 subjects. Two enriched reader studies were performed to compare digital mammography with tomosynthesis against digital mammography alone. Study 1 comprised 312 cases (48 cancer cases) with images read by 12 radiologists; study 2, 312 cases (51 cancer cases) with 15 radiologists. Study 1 readers recorded only that an abnormality requiring recall was present; study 2 readers had additional training and recorded both lesion type and location. Diagnostic accuracy was compared with receiver operating characteristic analysis. Recall rates of noncancer cases, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values determined by analyzing Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System scores were compared for the two methods.Diagnostic accuracy for combined tomosynthesis and digital mammography was superior to that of digital mammography alone. Average difference in area under the curve in study 1 was 7.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.7%, 10.8%; P < .001) and in study 2 was 6.8% (95% CI: 4.1%, 9.5%; P < .001). All 27 radiologists increased diagnostic accuracy with addition of tomosynthesis. Recall rates for noncancer cases for all readers significantly decreased with addition of tomosynthesis (range, 6%-67%; P < .001 for 25 readers, P < .03 for all readers). Increased sensitivity was largest for invasive cancers: 15% and 22% in studies 1 and 2 versus 3% for in situ cancers in both studies.Addition of tomosynthesis to digital mammography offers the dual benefit of significantly increased diagnostic accuracy and significantly reduced recall rates for noncancer cases.http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.12120674/-/DC1.",
        "Background Data on the long-term pulmonary sequelae in COVID-19 are lacking. Purpose To assess symptoms, functional impairment, and residual pulmonary abnormalities on serial chest CT scans in COVID-19 survivors discharged from hospital at up to 1-year follow-up. Materials and Methods Adult patients with COVID-19 discharged between March 2020 and June 2020 were prospectively evaluated at 3 months and 1 year through systematic assessment of symptoms, functional impairment, and thoracic CT scans as part of the PHENOTYPE study, an observational cohort study in COVID-19 survivors. Lung function testing was limited to participants with CT abnormalities and/or persistent breathlessness. Bonferroni correction was used. Results Eighty participants (mean age, 59 years \u00b1 13 [SD]; 53 men) were assessed. At outpatient review, persistent breathlessness was reported in 37 of the 80 participants (46%) and cough was reported in 17 (21%). CT scans in 73 participants after discharge (median, 105 days; IQR, 95-141 days) revealed persistent abnormalities in 41 participants (56%), with ground-glass opacification (35 of 73 participants [48%]) and bands (27 of 73 participants [37%]) predominating. Unequivocal signs indicative of established fibrosis (ie, volume loss and/or traction bronchiectasis) were present in nine of 73 participants (12%). Higher admission serum C-reactive protein (in milligrams per liter), fibrinogen (in grams per deciliter), urea (millimoles per liter), and creatinine (micromoles per liter) levels; longer hospital stay (in days); older age (in years); and requirement for invasive ventilation were associated with CT abnormalities at 3-month follow-up. Thirty-two of 41 participants (78%) with abnormal findings at 3-month follow-up CT underwent repeat imaging at a median of 364 days (range, 360-366 days), with 26 (81%) showing further radiologic improvement (median, 18%; IQR, 10%-40%). Conclusion CT abnormalities were common at 3 months after COVID-19 but with signs of fibrosis in a minority. More severe acute disease was linked with CT abnormalities at 3 months. However, radiologic improvement was seen in the majority at 1-year follow-up.

        "To investigate the use of cine multidetector computed tomography (CT) to detect changes in myocardial function in a swine cardiomyopathy model.All animal protocols were in accordance with the Principles for the Utilization and Care of Vertebrate Animals Used in Testing Research and Training and approved by the University of Missouri Animal Care and Use Committee. Strain analysis of cine multidetector CT images of the left ventricle was optimized and analyzed with feature-tracking software. The standard of reference for strain was harmonic phase analysis of tagged cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) images at 3.0 T. An animal model of cardiomyopathy was imaged with both cardiac MR and 320-section multidetector CT at a temporal resolution of less than 50 msec. Three groups were evaluated: control group (n = 5), aortic-banded myocardial hypertrophy group (n = 5), and aortic-banded and cyclosporine A- treated cardiomyopathy group (n = 5). Histologic samples of the myocardium were obtained for comparison with strain results. Dunnett test was used for comparisons of the concentric remodeling group and eccentric remodeling group against the control group.Collagen volume fraction ranged from 10.9% to 14.2%; lower collagen fraction values were seen in the control group than in the cardiomyopathy groups (P < .05). Ejection fraction and conventional metrics showed no significant differences between control and cardiomyopathy groups. Radial strain for both cardiac MR and multidetector CT was abnormal in both concentric (cardiac MR 25.1% \u00b1 4.2; multidetector CT 28.4% \u00b1 2.8) and eccentric (cardiac MR 23.2% \u00b1 2.0; multidetector CT 24.4% \u00b1 2.1) remodeling groups relative to control group (cardiac MR 18.9% \u00b1 1.9, multidetector CT 22.0% \u00b1 1.7, P < .05, all comparisons). Strain values for multidetector CT versus cardiac MR showed better agreement in the radial direction than in the circumferential direction (r = 0.55, P = .03 vs r = 0.40, P = .13, respectively).Multidetector CT strain analysis has potential to identify regional wall-motion abnormalities in cardiomyopathy that is not otherwise detected using conventional metrics of myocardial function.",
        "This Special Report presents the consensus of the Summit on Management of Radiation Dose in Computed Tomography (CT) (held in February 2011), which brought together participants from academia, clinical practice, industry, and regulatory and funding agencies to identify the steps required to reduce the effective dose from routine CT examinations to less than 1 mSv. The most promising technologies and methods discussed at the summit include innovations and developments in x-ray sources; detectors; and image reconstruction, noise reduction, and postprocessing algorithms. Access to raw projection data and standard data sets for algorithm validation and optimization is a clear need, as is the need for new, clinically relevant metrics of image quality and diagnostic performance. Current commercially available techniques such as automatic exposure control, optimization of tube potential, beam-shaping filters, and dynamic z-axis collimators are important, and education to successfully implement these methods routinely is critically needed. Other methods that are just becoming widely available, such as iterative reconstruction, noise reduction, and postprocessing algorithms, will also have an important role. Together, these existing techniques can reduce dose by a factor of two to four. Technical advances that show considerable promise for additional dose reduction but are several years or more from commercial availability include compressed sensing, volume of interest and interior tomography techniques, and photon-counting detectors. This report offers a strategic roadmap for the CT user and research and manufacturer communities toward routinely achieving effective doses of less than 1 mSv, which is well below the average annual dose from naturally occurring sources of radiation.",
        "History An asymptomatic 33-year-old woman was referred to the Hepatology Department in 2013 for work-up of indeterminate multifocal liver masses. These lesions were discovered incidentally at multiphase contrast material\u2013enhanced multidetector computed tomography (CT) performed in 2004 to investigate right lower quadrant pain. Imaging surveillance at sporadic intervals revealed slow progressive growth of the lesions over time; however, the number of lesions remained constant. There was no history of cancer, nor were there predisposing factors for chronic liver disease or cirrhosis. The patient had a history of menorrhagia, which was managed with oral contraceptive use for 20 years; this was stopped in 2013 after hysterectomy. The patient\u2019s \u03b3-glutamyl transferase (77 U/L [1.28 \u03bckat/L]; normal level, <55 U/L [<0.92 \u03bckat/L]) and C-reactive protein (97.1 mg/L [924.8 nmol/L]; normal level, <8 mg/L [<76.2 nmol/L]]) levels were chronically elevated at serum testing. In 2013, 9 years after the initial CT examination, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with gadoxetic acid (Primovist; Bayer Healthcare, Whippany, NJ) was performed. Finally, ultrasonography (US)-guided biopsy of one of the lesions (in segment 5/6) was performed a year after MR imaging.",
        "To compare the influence of triggering methods for diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) parameters in the liver, as well as regional variability and measurement repeatability.In this institutional review board-approved prospective study, 12 healthy volunteers (six women, six men; mean age, 30 years) underwent 1.5-T DWI of the liver by using nine b values twice with free breathing (FB) without triggering (mean acquisition time \u00b1 standard deviation, 3.7 minutes \u00b1 0), respiratory triggering (RT) (mean acquisition time, 6.8 minutes \u00b1 1.4), and echocardiography triggering (ET) (mean acquisition time, 8.3 minutes \u00b1 2.0) after providing written informed consent. ADC and IVIM parameters, including pure diffusion coefficient (D), perfusion fraction (f), and perfusion-related diffusion coefficient (D*), were measured by using 15 regions of interest (ROIs). Regional variability of ADC and IVIM parameters and measurement repeatability were evaluated by using the coefficient of variation (CV) across ROIs and within-subject CV, respectively.ET DWI (range of CV across ROIs, 6.69%-20.0%) resulted in significantly decreased regional variability of ADC, D, and f, compared with FB DWI (13.86%-35.8%) and RT DWI (15.15%-35.91%, P \u2264. 049). ET DWI showed better repeatability of ADC measurement (within-subject CV range, 3.17%-4.12% for ET DWI; 4.15%-4.74% for FB DWI; and 2.33%-6.96% for RT DWI), D (4.05%-5.34% for ET DWI, 4.11%-12.51% for FB DWI, and 3.19%-16.17% for RT DWI), and f (7.6%-9.86% for ET DWI, 13.83%-16.81% for FB DWI, and 10.05%-12.10% for RT DWI), compared with FB DWI and RT DWI, with significant differences in within-subject CV for D in the left hepatic lobe compared with RT DWI (P = .023) and for f compared with FB DWI (P \u2264 .032). For all three imaging techniques, D* showed the worst repeatability (within-subject CV, 57.05%-156.61%) among ADC and IVIM parameters.ET DWI is more effective for decreasing regional variability of ADC and IVIM parameters than FB DWI or RT DWI; it may improve measurement repeatability by reducing cardiac motion-induced measurement error.",
        "To identify prognostic imaging biomarkers in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by means of a radiogenomics strategy that integrates gene expression and medical images in patients for whom survival outcomes are not available by leveraging survival data in public gene expression data sets.A radiogenomics strategy for associating image features with clusters of coexpressed genes (metagenes) was defined. First, a radiogenomics correlation map is created for a pairwise association between image features and metagenes. Next, predictive models of metagenes are built in terms of image features by using sparse linear regression. Similarly, predictive models of image features are built in terms of metagenes. Finally, the prognostic significance of the predicted image features are evaluated in a public gene expression data set with survival outcomes. This radiogenomics strategy was applied to a cohort of 26 patients with NSCLC for whom gene expression and 180 image features from computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET)/CT were available.There were 243 statistically significant pairwise correlations between image features and metagenes of NSCLC. Metagenes were predicted in terms of image features with an accuracy of 59%-83%. One hundred fourteen of 180 CT image features and the PET standardized uptake value were predicted in terms of metagenes with an accuracy of 65%-86%. When the predicted image features were mapped to a public gene expression data set with survival outcomes, tumor size, edge shape, and sharpness ranked highest for prognostic significance.This radiogenomics strategy for identifying imaging biomarkers may enable a more rapid evaluation of novel imaging modalities, thereby accelerating their translation to personalized medicine.",
        "Purpose To investigate the relationship between magnetic resonance (MR) imaging markers of iron content and disease severity in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) over a 2-year period. Materials and Methods This prospective study was approved by the local ethics committee, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Seventeen patients with MS and 17 control subjects were examined twice, 2 years apart, by using phase imaging and transverse relaxation (R2*) mapping at 4.7 T. Quantitative differences in iron content in deep gray matter between patients and control subjects were evaluated with repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance separately for R2* mapping and phase imaging. Multiple regression analysis was used to evaluate correlations of MR imaging measures, both 2-year\u2013difference and single-time measurements, to baseline disease severity. Results R2* mapping using 2-year\u2013difference measurements had the highest correlation to disease severity (r = 0.905, P < .001) compared with R2* mapping using single-time measurements (r = 0.560, P = .019) and phase imaging by using either single-time (r = 0.539, P = .026) or 2-year\u2013difference (r = 0.644, P = .005) measurements. Significant increases in R2* occur during 2 years in the substantia nigra (P < .001) and globus pallidus (P = .035), which are both predictors of disease in regression analysis, in patients compared with control subjects. There were group differences in the substantia nigra, globus pallidus, pulvinar thalamus, thalamus, and caudate nucleus, compared with control subjects with R2* mapping (P < .05), and group differences in the caudate nucleus and pulvinar thalamus, compared with control subjects with phase imaging (P < .05). Conclusion There are significant changes in deep gray matter iron content in MS during 2 years measured with MR imaging, changes that are strongly related to physical disability. Longitudinal measurements may produce a higher correlation to disease severity compared with single-time measurements because baseline iron content of deep gray matter is variable among subjects. \u00a9RSNA, 2013",
        "Purpose To determine the feasibility of using a deep learning approach to detect cartilage lesions (including cartilage softening, fibrillation, fissuring, focal defects, diffuse thinning due to cartilage degeneration, and acute cartilage injury) within the knee joint on MR images. Materials and Methods A fully automated deep learning-based cartilage lesion detection system was developed by using segmentation and classification convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Fat-suppressed T2-weighted fast spin-echo MRI data sets of the knee of 175 patients with knee pain were retrospectively analyzed by using the deep learning method. The reference standard for training the CNN classification was the interpretation provided by a fellowship-trained musculoskeletal radiologist of the presence or absence of a cartilage lesion within 17 395 small image patches placed on the articular surfaces of the femur and tibia. Receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis and the \u03ba statistic were used to assess diagnostic performance and intraobserver agreement for detecting cartilage lesions for two individual evaluations performed by the cartilage lesion detection system. Results The sensitivity and specificity of the cartilage lesion detection system at the optimal threshold according to the Youden index were 84.1% and 85.2%, respectively, for evaluation 1 and 80.5% and 87.9%, respectively, for evaluation 2. Areas under the ROC curve were 0.917 and 0.914 for evaluations 1 and 2, respectively, indicating high overall diagnostic accuracy for detecting cartilage lesions. There was good intraobserver agreement between the two individual evaluations, with a \u03ba of 0.76. Conclusion This study demonstrated the feasibility of using a fully automated deep learning-based cartilage lesion detection system to evaluate the articular cartilage of the knee joint with high diagnostic performance and good intraobserver agreement for detecting cartilage degeneration and acute cartilage injury. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article .",
        "A 45-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with acute worsening of prolonged unexplained nausea, nonbilious vomiting, and mild upper abdominal pain of 4 years duration. Her bowel habits were regular, and there was no history of diarrhea or fresh or altered blood in her stool. On further inquiry, there was no history of facial flushing, excessive diaphoresis, or asthmalike symptoms. Her history was unrevealing; in particular, there was no history of known malignancy. On clinical examination, her vital signs were stable. The abdomen was soft, with no focal tenderness or palpable mass. Routine blood investigations, including complete blood counts, and liver, kidney, and thyroid function tests yielded results that were within normal limits. Her 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and chromogranin A levels were not elevated. Initial evaluation with contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed. Subsequently, an indium 111 (111In) octreotide scan was performed at the recommendation of the radiologist 1 month after CT.",
        "Purpose To evaluate the value of computed tomographic (CT) myelography in the detection of root damage and differentiation of root avulsions from neurotmesis in a large cohort of patients with an obstetric brachial plexus lesion (OBPL). Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval was obtained. Informed consent was waived by the medical ethics committee. One hundred eighteen patients with OBPL born in the cephalic position and six patients born in the breech position were selected for surgery by two neurosurgeons in a multidisciplinary team. Functional loss of the C5 through T1 innervated muscles was noted. All patients underwent preoperative CT myelography at an average age of 19 weeks. CT myelographic examination results were reviewed by two radiologists, who were blinded to the clinical findings, for the presence of root avulsions and pseudocysts. Interobserver agreement was assessed by calculating \u03ba values. Results CT myelographic results showed root avulsions in at least one level in 66 (56%) of 118 patients born in the cephalic position and in six (100%) of six patients born in the breech position. Levels C7 and C8 showed the most root avulsions, even if not expected from clinical examination results. A large number of root avulsions showed pseudocysts (73 [68%] of 107 levels in patients born in the cephalic position and 11 [73%] of 15 levels in patients born in the breech position). Conclusion CT myelographic results showed root avulsions in more than half of patients with OBPL. Root avulsions were even detected at levels that were not expected at clinical examination. Because root avulsions require specific reconstructive techniques, CT myelography is recommended for every preoperative patient with OBPL. \u00a9 RSNA, 2011",
        "History A 57-year-old man with no remarkable past medical history presented to an outside institution with painless swelling in his right thigh of 6 months duration. He denied any trauma to the site. At that time, physical examination demonstrated swelling in his right upper thigh. All other work-up, including complete blood count and chest radiography, yielded negative results. The initial diagnosis was lymphangioma of the thigh. He continued to experience worsening swelling in his right upper thigh with no other symptoms over the next year. He was referred to our facility, where he underwent US evaluation of the thigh lesion (Fig 1), an MRI scan encompassing the entire extent of his thigh lesion (Fig 2), and a CT scan of his abdomen and pelvis (Fig 3).",
        "Purpose To determine the prevalence of and risk factors for needlesticks in interventional radiology physicians, as well as the attitudes, behaviors, and conditions that promote or interfere with reporting of these injuries. Materials and Methods A total of 3889 interventional radiologists from academic and private practice in the United States were surveyed by emailing all interventional radiologist members of the Society of Interventional Radiology, including attending-level physicians and trainees (April-August 2016). The institutional review board waived the need for consent. Questions inquired about the nature, frequency, and type of needlestick and sharps injuries and whether and to whom these incidents were reported. Stepwise regression was used to determine variables predicting whether injuries were reported. Results In total, 908 (23%) interventional radiologists completed at least a portion of the survey. Eight hundred fourteen (91%) of 895 respondents reported a prior needlestick injury, 583 (35%) of 895 reported at least one injury while treating an HIV-positive patient, and 626 (71%) of 884 reported prior training regarding needlestick injury. There was, on average, one needlestick for every 5 years of practice. Most needlestick or sharps injuries were self inflicted (711 [87%] of 817) and involved a hollow-bore device (464 [56%] of 824). Only 566 (66%) of 850 injuries were reported. The most common reasons for not reporting included perceived lack of utility of reporting (79 [28%] of 282), perceived low risk for injury (56 [20%] of 282), noncontaminated needle (53 [19%] of 282), too-lengthy reporting process (37 [13%] of 282), and associated stigma (23 [8%] of 282). Only 156 (25%) of 624 respondents informed their significant other. Stepwise regression assessing variables affecting the likelihood of reporting showed that male sex (P = .009), low-risk patient (P < .0001), self injury (P = .010), trainee status (P < .0001), and the total number of prior injuries (P = .019) were independent predictors of not reporting. Conclusion Needlestick injuries are ubiquitous among interventional radiologists and are often not reported. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To assess diagnostic sensitivity of radial T1-weighted gradient-echo (radial volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination [VIBE]) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, positron emission tomography (PET), and combined simultaneous PET and MR imaging with an integrated PET/MR system in the detection of lung nodules, with combined PET and computed tomography (CT) as a reference.In this institutional review board-approved HIPAA-compliant prospective study, 32 patients with tumors who underwent clinically warranted fluorine 18 ((18)F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT followed by PET/MR imaging were included. In all patients, the thorax station was examined with free-breathing radial VIBE MR imaging and simultaneously acquired PET data. Presence and size of nodules and FDG avidity were assessed on PET/CT, radial VIBE, PET, and PET/MR images. Percentage of nodules detected on radial VIBE and PET images was compared with that on PET/MR images by using generalized estimating equations. Maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) in pulmonary nodules with a diameter of at least 1 cm was compared between PET/CT and PET/MR imaging with Pearson rank correlation.A total of 69 nodules, including 45 FDG-avid nodules, were detected with PET/CT. The sensitivity of PET/MR imaging was 70.3% for all nodules, 95.6% for FDG-avid nodules, and 88.6% for nodules 0.5 cm in diameter or larger. PET/MR imaging had higher sensitivity than PET for all nodules (70.3% vs 61.6%, P = .002) and higher sensitivity than MR imaging for FDG-avid nodules (95.6% vs 80.0%, P = .008). There was a significantly strong correlation between SUVmax of pulmonary nodules obtained with PET/CT and that obtained with PET/MR imaging (r = 0.96, P < .001).Radial VIBE and PET data acquired simultaneously with PET/MR imaging have high sensitivity in the detection of FDG-avid nodules and nodules 0.5 cm in diameter or larger, with low sensitivity for small non-FDG-avid nodules.",
        "Purpose To investigate parameters based on fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging that are best correlated with pathologic complete response (PCR) in human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)\u2013positive cancer and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and with partial or complete response in ER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer. Materials and Methods This study was approved by institutional review board with waivers of informed written consent and included consecutive patients treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Five PET examination\u2013derived parameters were tested: standard uptake value (SUV) maximum (SUVmax), peak (SUVpeak), and mean (SUVmean), metabolically active tumor volume, and total lesion glycolysis (TLG). Absolute values at baseline PET, at PET imaging after two cycles of chemotherapy, and variation (ie, change) were measured. Correlations with pathologic response (Wilcoxon rank-sum test) and predictive power assessed (area under the curve [AUC] on the basis of receiver operating characteristic analysis) were examined. Results Included were 169 consecutive patients (mean age, 50 years). PCR was more frequent in HER2-positive tumors (16 of 33 patients [48.5%]) and TNBCs (20 of 54 patients [37%]) than in ER positive/HER2-negative tumors (four of 82 [4.9%]) (P < .001). Among patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative cancers, 33 patients had partial response. In TNBC, best association with PCR was obtained with change in SUVmax (AUC, 0.86) or change in TLG (AUC, 0.88). In HER2-positive phenotype, absolute SUVmax (or SUVpeak) values at PET imaging after two cycles of chemotherapy (AUC for each cycle, 0.93) were better correlated with PCR than change in SUVmax (AUC, 0.78; P = .11) or change in TLG (AUC, 0.62; P = .005). Regarding ER-positive/HER2-negative cancers, change in SUVmax or change in TLG (AUC, 0.75) were parameters best correlated with partial or complete response. Baseline SUVmax was higher in lymph nodes than in primary tumor in 31 patients. Findings were similar considering the site with highest FDG uptake. Conclusion Quantitative indexes of tumor glucose use that are best correlated with pathologic response vary by phenotype: change in SUVmax or TLG are most adequate for TNBCs and ER-positive/ HER2-negative cancers and absolute SUVmax after two cycles of chemotherapy for HER2-positive breast cancers. \u00a9 RSNA, 2015",

        "A 54-year-old man was found by paramedics in his home face-down at his computer desk with a substantially reduced level of consciousness. He had not contacted his family for more than 50 hours. The patient lived alone and was a heavy smoker with a history of alcohol abuse. His medical history was otherwise unremarkable, and there was no history of cancer, psoriasis, or rheumatoid arthritis, nor was there a history of methotrexate administration. At presentation to the emergency department, he was mildly hypotensive and was experiencing hypercapnic respiratory failure and acute renal failure with rhabdomyolysis. His toxicology screen was mildly positive for opiates. He received naloxone (Narcan; Emergent) with minimal effect. An unenhanced CT scan of the head was obtained. Of note, this patient's presentation predated the COVID-19 pandemic. He was admitted to the intensive care unit for decreased level of consciousness and respiratory failure. The decreased level of consciousness was thought to be secondary to seizure, as he developed seizurelike movements prior to intubation, probably in the context of intoxication or alcohol withdrawal. Electroencephalography revealed moderate bilateral cerebral dysfunction and encephalopathy, with no evidence of nonconvulsive seizures. He had a short course of intermittent hemodialysis and was discharged home 8 days later with an appointment for neurology follow-up. At discharge, he was at his cognitive and functional baseline. Approximately 3 weeks later, the patient was brought back to the emergency department for progressive confusion and decrease in balance. He became apathetic with reduced psychomotor activity and was no longer able to perform basic daily activities, such as cooking or bathing. He displayed bizarre behavior, such as staring at a wall for hours, and was somnolent, irritable, and inattentive. He eventually became incontinent of urine and stool. Results of a neurologic examination of the cranial nerves, motor function, sensation, and reflexes were normal. The results of blood work-up were grossly normal, and the results of an extensive toxicology work-up were negative. Repeat head CT was performed. MRI was ordered to further investigate the patient's encephalopathic presentation.",

        "Background Multicenter studies are required to validate the added benefit of using deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) software for detecting malignant pulmonary nodules on chest radiographs. Purpose To compare the performance of radiologists in detecting malignant pulmonary nodules on chest radiographs when assisted by deep learning\u2013based DCNN software with that of radiologists or DCNN software alone in a multicenter setting. Materials and Methods Investigators at four medical centers retrospectively identified 600 lung cancer\u2013containing chest radiographs and 200 normal chest radiographs. Each radiograph with a lung cancer had at least one malignant nodule confirmed by CT and pathologic examination. Twelve radiologists from the four centers independently analyzed the chest radiographs and marked regions of interest. Commercially available deep learning\u2013based computer-aided detection software separately trained, tested, and validated with 19 330 radiographs was used to find suspicious nodules. The radiologists then reviewed the images with the assistance of DCNN software. The sensitivity and number of false-positive findings per image of DCNN software, radiologists alone, and radiologists with the use of DCNN software were analyzed by using logistic regression and Poisson regression. Results The average sensitivity of radiologists improved (from 65.1% [1375 of 2112; 95% confidence interval {CI}: 62.0%, 68.1%] to 70.3% [1484 of 2112; 95% CI: 67.2%, 73.1%], P < .001) and the number of false-positive findings per radiograph declined (from 0.2 [488 of 2400; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.22] to 0.18 [422 of 2400; 95% CI: 0.16, 0.2], P < .001) when the radiologists re-reviewed radiographs with the DCNN software. For the 12 radiologists in this study, 104 of 2400 radiographs were positively changed (from false-negative to true-positive or from false-positive to true-negative) using the DCNN, while 56 of 2400 radiographs were changed negatively.

        "BackgroundDeep learning has the potential to augment the use of chest radiography in clinical radiology, but challenges include poor generalizability, spectrum bias, and difficulty comparing across studies.PurposeTo develop and evaluate deep learning models for chest radiograph interpretation by using radiologist-adjudicated reference standards.Materials and MethodsDeep learning models were developed to detect four findings (pneumothorax, opacity, nodule or mass, and fracture) on frontal chest radiographs. This retrospective study used two data sets. Data set 1 (DS1) consisted of 759 611 images from a multicity hospital network and ChestX-ray14 is a publicly available data set with 112 120 images. Natural language processing and expert review of a subset of images provided labels for 657 954 training images. Test sets consisted of 1818 and 1962 images from DS1 and ChestX-ray14, respectively. Reference standards were defined by radiologist-adjudicated image review. Performance was evaluated by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value. Four radiologists reviewed test set images for performance comparison. Inverse probability weighting was applied to DS1 to account for positive radiograph enrichment and estimate population-level performance.ResultsIn DS1, population-adjusted areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for pneumothorax, nodule or mass, airspace opacity, and fracture were, respectively, 0.95 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.91, 0.99), 0.72 (95% CI: 0.66, 0.77), 0.91 (95% CI: 0.88, 0.93), and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.79, 0.92).

        "An 11-year-old girl presented to the pediatric gastroenterology outpatient department of our institution with gradually increasing painless abdominal distention. The distention started 2 years earlier and was not associated with any other constitutional symptoms, vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice, hematemesis, or melaena. She reported early satiety and heaviness in the lower abdomen. The abdominal swelling was predominantly in the infraumbilical region and was soft at palpation. She was the first child of nonconsanguineous parents and had an uneventful perinatal course after a normal vaginal delivery. Her developmental milestones were normal. She had an average scholastic performance at school. There was no history of visual problems, seizures, or inappropriate behaviors. She had an early menarche 2 years previously. Her menstrual cycles were regular, and there was no abnormal vaginal discharge. Her breast development was normal (Tanner stage III), while pubic and axillary hair were absent (Tanner stage I). She was short for her age (104 cm; normal range, 120-154 cm). There was no history of short stature among her siblings or parents. Laboratory investigations were performed to measure thyroid-stimulating hormone (1354.34 \u03bcIU/mL; normal range, 0.35-5.5 \u03bcIU/mL), triiodothyronine (<2.5 ng/dL [0.0385 pmol/L]; normal range, 100-200 ng/dL [1.54-3.08 pmol/L]), thyroxine (1.35 \u03bcg/dL [17.37 nmol/L]; normal range, 5-12 \u03bcg/dL [64.35-154.44 nmol/L]), \u03b2-human chorionic gonadotropin (<1.2 mIU/mL; normal, <5 mIU/mL), luteinizing hormone (0.08 mIU/mL; normal range, 0.1-6.0 mIU/mL), and follicle-stimulating hormone (6.93 mIU/mL; normal range, 0.3-2.0 mIU/mL) levels. Complete blood count was normal. An abdominal mass was suspected, and abdominopelvic CT was performed and followed by US; these examinations revealed multiple large cysts in both ovaries (Figs 1, 2A, 2B). The uterus was pubertal in shape, and endometrial thickness was 9 mm, representing normal follicular phase measurement. Serum CA-125 and inhibin levels were normal. To evaluate short stature, radiographs of the hand (Fig 3) and pelvis (Fig 3B) were obtained as part of a limited skeletal survey, keeping in mind the possible skeletal changes associated with hypothyroidism.

        "To determine if the combination of gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging helps to increase accuracy and sensitivity in the diagnosis of small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) compared with those achieved by using each MR imaging technique alone.The institutional review board approved this retrospective study and waived the requirement for informed consent. The study included 130 patients (95 men, 35 women) with 179 surgically confirmed small HCCs (\u22642.0 cm) and 130 patients with cirrhosis (90 men, 40 women) without HCC who underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging and DW imaging at 3.0 T between May 2009 and July 2010. Three sets of images were analyzed independently by three observers to detect HCC: a gadoxetic acid set (unenhanced, early dynamic, and hepatobiliary phases), a DW imaging set, and a combined set. Data were analyzed by using alternative-free response receiver operating characteristic analysis. Diagnostic accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [A(z)]), sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value were calculated.The mean A(z) values for the combined set (0.952) were significantly higher than those for the gadoxetic acid set (A(z) = 0.902) or the DW imaging set alone (A(z) = 0.871) (P \u2264 .008). On a per-lesion basis, observers showed higher sensitivity in their analyses of the combined set (range, 91.1%-93.3% [163-167 of 179]) than in those of the gadoxetic acid set (range, 80.5%-82.1% [144-147 of 179]) or the DW imaging set alone (range, 77.7%-79.9% [139-143 of 179]) (P \u2264 .003). Positive predictive values and specificity for all observers were equivalent for the three imaging sets.The combination of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging and DW imaging yielded better diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity in the detection of small HCCs than each MR imaging technique alone.",
        "To evaluate the feasibility and safety of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-guided laser-based thermotherapy in men with clinically low-risk prostate cancer and a concordant lesion at biopsy and MR imaging.This HIPAA-compliant phase I prospective study was approved by the institutional review board. Informed consent was obtained from all patients. Transperineal MR imaging-guided focal laser ablation for clinically low-risk prostate cancer was performed in patients with a Gleason score of 7 or less in three or fewer cores limited to one sextant obtained with transrectal ultrasonography (US)-guided biopsy and a concordant lesion at MR imaging. Lesions were targeted with a laser ablation system. Periprocedural complications were recorded. The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and the Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) score were collected before and after the procedure. MR imaging-guided biopsy of the ablation zone was performed 6 months after treatment. The prostate-specific antigen level, IPSS, and SHIM score before and after ablation were compared by using the Wilcoxon signed rank test.Treatment was successfully completed in nine patients (procedure duration, 2.5-4 hours; mean laser ablation duration, 4.3 minutes). Immediate contrast-enhanced posttreatment MR imaging showed a hypovascular defect in eight patients. Self-resolving perineal abrasion and focal paresthesia of the glans penis each occurred in one patient. The mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) IPSS and SHIM score at baseline were 5.8 \u00b1 5.3 and 19.0 \u00b1 8.0, respectively. Average score changes were not significantly different from zero during follow-up (P = .18-.99). MR imaging-guided biopsy of the ablation zone showed no cancer in seven patients (78%) and Gleason grade 6 cancer in two (22%).Transperineal MR imaging-guided focal laser ablation appears to be a feasible and safe focal therapy option for clinically low-risk prostate cancer.",
        "Purpose To evaluate whether microbubbles targeted to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) (CD106) coupled with a magnetic guidance system could improve the efficacy of contrast-enhanced molecular ultrasonography (US) of atherosclerosis in the aorta. Materials and Methods The animal research committee at Southern Medical University approved all experiments. Adherence of magnetic VCAM-1\u2013targeted microbubbles, control inactive magnetic microbubbles, and nonmagnetic VCAM-1\u2013targeted microbubbles to VCAM-1-Fc was determined in vitro by using a flow chamber at variable shear stress (1\u201324 dyne/cm2) under magnetic field guidance. Attachment of microbubbles under magnetic field guidance was determined in vivo with fluorescent microscopy and contrast-enhanced US of the abdominal aorta in wild-type (C57BL/6) or apolipoprotein E (APOE)\u2013deficient mice on a regular or hypercholesterolemic diet. General factorial analysis of variance was used to compare the targeted effect of the microbubbles among different animal groups to identify significant differences. Results Attachment was noted for magnetic and nonmagnetic microbubbles but not for inactive magnetic microbubbles; firm attachment at high shear stress (16\u201320 dyne/cm2) was achieved only with magnetic microbubbles. Fluorescence intensity and video intensity were significantly higher in magnetic microbubbles with magnetic field guidance than in inactive magnetic microbubbles and nonmagnetic microbubbles (P < .05). Video intensity from retained magnetic microbubbles in APOE-deficient mice was significantly greater than that in wild-type mice (mean video intensity for APOE-deficient mice: 28.25 [interquartile range, or IQR, 26.55\u201329.20] with a hypercholesterolemic diet and 16.10 [IQR, 14.15\u201318.75] with a regular diet; mean video intensity for wild-type mice: 9.55 [IQR, 8.85\u201310.5] with a hypercholesterolemic diet and 2.90 [IQR, 1.25\u20133.85] with a regular diet; P < .001). Conclusion Use of a magnetic targeted microbubble system results in greater attachment to endothelial VCAM-1 in atherosclerotic aortas in conditions of high shear stress and improved detection of early inflammatory changes of atherosclerosis. \u00a9 RSNA, 2011 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.11102251/-/DC1",

Her medical history included hypothyroidism from Hashimoto thyroiditis and pneumonia with left pleural effusion. She had no smoking history, and her body mass index was normal (23.8 kg/m2). No medication use was reported at admission. Physical examination revealed mild bilateral ptosis, reduced muscle tone and strength that worsened in proximal leg muscles, and decreased deep tendon reflexes. An edrophonium test revealed improvement in muscle strength and eyelid ptosis. Repetitive nerve stimulation revealed low amplitude of compound muscle action potential at rest (0.21 mV), with a marked increase (700%; normal increase, <60%) at high-rate stimulation (50 Hz). Laboratory work-up was unremarkable except for detection of acetylcholine receptor antibodies in the serum (21.30 nmol/L) and P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel antibodies (220 pmol/L). Recent MRI of the brain and spine at an outside hospital showed no abnormal findings. At admission, the patient underwent CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis followed by thoracic MRI to further evaluate CT findings.",
        "To test the hypothesis that leukoaraiosis alters functional activation during a semantic decision language task.With institutional review board approval and written informed consent, 18 right-handed, cognitively healthy elderly participants with an aggregate leukoaraiosis lesion volume of more than 25 cm(3) and 18 age-matched control participants with less than 5 cm(3) of leukoaraiosis underwent functional MR imaging to allow comparison of activation during semantic decisions with that during visual perceptual decisions. Brain statistical maps were derived from the general linear model. Spatially normalized group t maps were created from individual contrast images. A cluster extent threshold of 215 voxels was used to correct for multiple comparisons. Intergroup random effects analysis was performed. Language laterality indexes were calculated for each participant.In control participants, semantic decisions activated the bilateral visual cortex, left posteroinferior temporal lobe, left posterior cingulate gyrus, left frontal lobe expressive language regions, and left basal ganglia. Visual perceptual decisions activated the right parietal and posterior temporal lobes. Participants with leukoaraiosis showed reduced activation in all regions associated with semantic decisions; however, activation associated with visual perceptual decisions increased in extent. Intergroup analysis showed significant activation decreases in the left anterior occipital lobe (P=.016), right posterior temporal lobe (P=.048), and right basal ganglia (P=.009) in particpants with leukoariosis. Individual participant laterality indexes showed a strong trend (P=.059) toward greater left lateralization in the leukoaraiosis group.Moderate leukoaraiosis is associated with atypical functional activation during semantic decision tasks. Consequently, leukoaraiosis is an important confounding variable in functional MR imaging studies of elderly individuals.",
        "Background There currently is no consensus on the optimal localization procedure and imaging protocol for parathyroid adenoma. Parathyroid four-dimensional (4D) CT has emerged as a promising method for preoperative localization. Purpose To evaluate the diagnostic performance of parathyroid 4D CT and technetium 99m-sestamibi (hereafter, referred to as sestamibi) SPECT/CT in preoperative localization in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Materials and Methods This was a single-institution retrospective study of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism who underwent a combined imaging protocol of sestamibi SPECT/CT and 4D CT (noncontrast, contrast agent-enhanced, arterial, and delayed venous phases) acquired in a single setting from February 2013 to May 2016, with subsequent parathyroidectomy within 6 months. Reference standard for correct localization was on the basis of location denoted on operative reports, with pathologic confirmation of parathyroid adenoma or hyperplasia. By using a four-quadrant analysis, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) for localization of the hyperfunctioning parathyroid gland or glands at sestamibi SPECT/CT and 4D CT were compared, per modality and in combination. Results Four hundred patients (319 women, 81 men; mean age, 61 years \u00b1 14 [standard deviation]) were evaluated. Similar diagnostic performance was found in both combined 4D CT with sestamibi SPECT/CT and 4D CT alone (area under the curve [AUC], 0.88 [95% CI: 0.86, 0.90] and 0.87 [95% CI: 0.85, 0.90], respectively; P = .82). Both modalities outperformed sestamibi SPECT/CT (AUC, 0.78; 95% CI: 0.76, 0.81; P < .001). Four-dimensional CT showed higher sensitivity than did sestamibi SPECT/CT (sensitivity, 79.3% [414 of 522] vs 58.0% [303 of 522], respectively; P < .001). In a subset analysis, 4D CT had higher sensitivity than sestamibi SPECT/CT in patients with single-gland disease (sensitivity, 92.5% [297 of 321] vs 75.1% [241 of 321], respectively; P < .001) and with multigland disease (sensitivity, 58.2% [117 of 201] vs 30.8% [62 of 201], respectively; P < .001). Conclusion Four-dimensional CT provided superior preoperative localization compared with sestamibi SPECT/CT in patients with single and multigland disease. The combination of the two modalities did not improve diagnostic performance compared with four-dimensional CT alone. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Purpose To examine whether dexamethasone suppression can reduce fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in false-positive (FP) findings in pulmonary and mediastinal lymph nodes in non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Materials and Methods Institutional ethics review board approved this prospective study with written informed consent. The study population was composed of 17 patients with NSCLC who underwent both baseline and dexamethasone suppression (24 hours after oral administration of 8 mg dexamethasone) FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography and surgery. FDG uptake was evaluated by using a five-point visual scoring system (negative findings, score of 0\u20131; positive findings, score of 2\u20134) and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax). The Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon signed-rank, Kruskal-Wallis, or Spearman rank correlation tests were used as necessary for statistical evaluations. Results In 17 primary lesions, no significant difference was noted in visual score between baseline (mean, 3.4 \u00b1 1.2) and dexamethasone suppression scans (mean, 3.3 \u00b1 1.2; P = .16), although SUVmax was significantly lower on dexamethasone suppression scans (mean, 7.1 \u00b1 5.2) than on baseline scans (mean, 8.6 \u00b1 6.6; P = .005). In eight nodes with true-positive (TP) findings, there were no significant differences in visual score (mean for both, 3.8 \u00b1 0.5) and SUVmax (mean, 5.3 \u00b1 2.3 vs 5.5 \u00b1 2.5, respectively; P = .81) between baseline and dexamethasone suppression scans. In 19 nodes with FP findings at baseline, dexamethasone suppression resulted in significantly lowered visual score (mean, 3.4 \u00b1 0.6 vs 2.4 \u00b1 0.8, respectively; P < .001) and SUVmax (mean, 3.5 \u00b1 0.8 vs 2.7 \u00b1 0.7, respectively; P < .001), and four nodes with FP findings were rated as true-negative findings on dexamethasone suppression scans, which resulted in a significant difference in SUVmax between nodal lesions with TP and FP findings (P = .014). Conclusion Oral dexamethasone has the potential to reduce FDG uptake in pulmonary and mediastinal nodes with FP findings in NSCLC. \u00a9 RSNA, 2015 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To evaluate the utility of hepatocyte-phase gadoxetate disodium-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in staging hepatic fibrosis and to compare it with diffusion-weighted imaging.This retrospective study had institutional review board approval, and the requirement for informed consent was waived. Gadoxetate disodium-enhanced and diffusion-weighted MR images obtained in 114 consecutive patients (70 men, 44 women; age range, 37-91 years) were evaluated. Liver-to-muscle signal intensity (SI) ratio on hepatocyte-phase images (SI(post)), contrast enhancement index calculated as SI(post) /SI(pre), where SI(pre) is liver-to-muscle SI ratio on nonenhanced images, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the liver were measured. Necroinflammatory activity grades and hepatic fibrosis stages were histopathologically determined in 99 patients. Multiple regressions of SI(post), contrast enhancement index, ADC, serum albumin concentration, serum total bilirubin level, prothrombin time, and Child-Pugh score were examined to determine correlation with hepatic necroinflammatory activity grades and fibrosis stages.Among the MR, hematologic, and clinical parameters, contrast enhancement index was most strongly correlated with fibrosis stage (r = -0.79, P < .001). Multiple regression analysis showed that the contrast enhancement index, ADC, and prothrombin time were significantly correlated (r(2) = 0.66, P < .05) with fibrosis stage and that the contrast enhancement index and serum total bilirubin level were weakly correlated (r(2) = 0.24, P < .05) with the necroinflammatory activity grade.Gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MR imaging is more reliable for staging hepatic fibrosis than are diffusion-weighted MR imaging, hematologic, and clinical parameters.",
        "Purpose To retrospectively determine the relationship between apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) obtained with 3.0-T diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and Gleason grades in peripheral zone prostate cancer. Materials and Methods The requirement to obtain institutional review board approval was waived. Fifty-one patients with prostate cancer underwent MR imaging before prostatectomy, including DW MR imaging with b values of 0, 50, 500, and 800 sec/mm2. In prostatectomy specimens, separate slice-by-slice determinations of Gleason grade groups were performed according to primary, secondary, and tertiary Gleason grades. In addition, tumors were classified into qualitative grade groups (low-, intermediate-, or high-grade tumors). ADC maps were aligned to step-sections and regions of interest annotated for each tumor slice. The median ADC of tumors was related to qualitative grade groups with linear mixed-model regression analysis. The accuracy of the median ADC in the most aggressive tumor component in the differentiation of low- from combined intermediate- and high-grade tumors was summarized by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (Az). Results In 51 prostatectomy specimens, 62 different tumors and 251 step-section tumor lesions were identified. The median ADC in the tumors showed a negative relationship with Gleason grade group, and differences among the three qualitative grade groups were statistically significant (P < .001). Overall, with an increase of one qualitative grade group, the median ADC (\u00b1standard deviation) decreased 0.18 \u00d7 10\u22123 mm2/sec \u00b1 0.02. Low-, intermediate-, and high-grade tumors had a median ADC of 1.30 \u00d7 10\u22123 mm2/sec \u00b1 0.30, 1.07 \u00d7 10\u22123 mm2/sec \u00b1 0.30, and 0.94 \u00d7 10\u22123 mm2/sec \u00b1 0.30, respectively. ROC analysis showed a discriminatory performance of Az = 0.90 in discerning low-grade from combined intermediate- and high-grade lesions. Conclusion ADCs at 3.0 T showed an inverse relationship to Gleason grades in peripheral zone prostate cancer. A high discriminatory performance was achieved in the differentiation of low-, intermediate-, and high-grade cancer. \u00a9 RSNA, 2011",
        "INTRODUCTION: In the last two decades sonography has become the most important imaging modality for the study of the spleen. Different studies were conducted in different parts of the world so as to determine the normal reference values of splenic dimension using ultrasound scan in healthy adults and the values obtained are diverse, thus prompting more work that tends to establish normal values for different regions based on geographic and racial differences.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHOD: A prospective study of normal spleen dimensions using ultrasound in 400 Nigerian adults at Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital was conducted. Sonographic measurement of splenic dimensions was done with the patient in supine and right lateral decubitus position. Height and weight were measured using standard anthropometric technique. The data was analysed using computer based SPSS 11.0 software for windows.\r\nRESULTS: There were 212 males and 188 females, their age ranged between 20 and 70 years. The mean age of the subjects was 33.0years (\u00b112.0), mean height was 1.64m (\u00b10.1) and mean weight was 61.4kg (\u00b111.0). The mean splenic length width and depth for the subjects studied were 101.6mm (\u00b113.7), 46.8mm (\u00b18.2), and 86.8mm (\u00b112.7) respectively.\r\nCONCLUSION: The mean spleen dimensions obtained in this study were similar to those\r\nobtained in other regions of Nigeria but slightly lower than those reported from studies among\r\nCaucasians confirming the need for normal values for each region. There was no statistically significant correlation of the splenic dimensions with age in either sex. There was positive correlation between subjects height and weight with splenic length (P<0.001 and P<0.001), depth (P<0.01 and P<0.001) and width (P<0.01 and P<0.001).",
        "Background Use of artificial intelligence (AI) as a stand-alone reader for digital mammography (DM) or digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) breast screening could ease radiologists' workload while maintaining quality. Purpose To retrospectively evaluate the stand-alone performance of an AI system as an independent reader of DM and DBT screening examinations. Materials and Methods Consecutive screening-paired and independently read DM and DBT images acquired between January 2015 and December 2016 were retrospectively collected from the Tomosynthesis Cordoba Screening Trial. An AI system computed a cancer risk score (range, 1\u2013100) for DM and DBT examinations independently. AI stand-alone performance was measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and sensitivity and recall rate at different operating points selected to have noninferior sensitivity compared with the human readings (noninferiority margin, 5%). The recall rate of AI and the human readings were compared using a McNemar test. Results A total of 15 999 DM and DBT examinations (113 breast cancers, including 98 screen-detected and 15 interval cancers) from 15 998 women (mean age, 58 years \u00b1 6 [standard deviation]) were evaluated. AI achieved an AUC of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.89, 0.96) for DM and 0.94 (95% CI: 0.91, 0.97) for DBT. For DM, AI achieved noninferior sensitivity as a single (58.4%; 66 of 113; 95% CI: 49.2, 67.1) or double (67.3%; 76 of 113; 95% CI: 58.2, 75.2) reader, with a reduction in recall rate (P < .001) of up to 2% (95% CI: \u22122.4, \u22121.6). For DBT, AI achieved noninferior sensitivity as a single (77%; 87 of 113; 95% CI: 68.4, 83.8) or double (81.4%; 92 of 113; 95% CI: 73.3, 87.5) reader, but with a higher recall rate (P < .001) of up to 12.3% (95% CI: 11.7, 12.9). Conclusion Artificial intelligence could replace radiologists' readings in breast screening, achieving a noninferior sensitivity, with a lower recall rate for digital mammography but a higher recall rate for digital breast tomosynthesis.

        "A 45-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with acute worsening of prolonged unexplained nausea, nonbilious vomiting, and mild upper abdominal pain of 4 years duration. Her bowel habits were regular, and there was no history of diarrhea or fresh or altered blood in her stool. On further inquiry, there was no history of facial flushing, excessive diaphoresis, or asthmalike symptoms. Her history was unrevealing; in particular, there was no history of known malignancy. On clinical examination, her vital signs were stable. The abdomen was soft, with no focal tenderness or palpable mass. Routine blood investigations, including complete blood counts, and liver, kidney, and thyroid function tests yielded results that were within normal limits. Her 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and chromogranin A levels were not elevated. Initial evaluation with contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed.

        "Background There are limited data on outcomes following screening breast MRI in women with a personal history of breast cancer (PHBC). Purpose To investigate outcomes and factors associated with subsequent cancers following a negative screening MRI study in women with a PHBC. Materials and Methods Consecutive women with a PHBC and a negative prevalence screening breast MRI result between August 2014 and December 2016 were retrospectively identified. Inclusion criteria were prevalence screening MRI performed as part of routine surveillance protocol (1\u20133 years after treatment) and follow-up data for at least 12 months. The incidence and characteristics of subsequent cancers were reviewed. Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate associations between clinical-pathologic characteristics and subsequent cancers. Performance metrics were compared among screening MRI, mammography, and US. Results A total of 993 women (mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 53 years \u00b1 10) were evaluated. Ten second in-breast cancers (ie, ipsilateral or contralateral) occurred at a median interval of 31.8 months (range, 13.3\u201344.8 months) after MRI, of which eight (80%) were ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or node-negative T1 cancers. Only one node-negative T1mi (tumor \u22641 mm) second in-breast cancer visible on a mammogram was detected within 24 months of MRI. Of second in-breast cancers, 40% (four of 10) were detected only at subsequent screening MRI, which was performed a median of 30.5 months after negative prevalence screening MRI. Ten local-regional recurrences occurred at a median interval of 16.9 months (range, 6\u201335 months). Previous treatment for DCIS was associated with second in-breast cancers (odds ratio, 3.73; 95% CI: 1.04, 13.38; P = .04). In 1048 women who underwent prevalence screening MRI (including all Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System categories), MRI showed a lower abnormal interpretation rate and higher specificity than mammography or US (P < .001 for all). Conclusion After a negative screening MRI result, 90% of subsequent cancers were detected at intervals longer than 24 months and there was a low second in-breast cancer rate (1%). \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 Supplemental material is available for this article.

        "In the past decade, the field of medical image analysis has grown exponentially, with an increased number of pattern recognition tools and an increase in data set sizes. These advances have facilitated the development of processes for high-throughput extraction of quantitative features that result in the conversion of images into mineable data and the subsequent analysis of these data for decision support; this practice is termed radiomics. This is in contrast to the traditional practice of treating medical images as pictures intended solely for visual interpretation. Radiomic data contain first-, second-, and higher-order statistics. These data are combined with other patient data and are mined with sophisticated bioinformatics tools to develop models that may potentially improve diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive accuracy. Because radiomics analyses are intended to be conducted with standard of care images, it is conceivable that conversion of digital images to mineable data will eventually become routine practice. This report describes the process of radiomics, its challenges, and its potential power to facilitate better clinical decision making, particularly in the care of patients with cancer.",
        "Purpose To compare multiparametric diagnostic performance with diffusion-weighted, dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast material\u2013enhanced perfusion-weighted, and susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for differentiating primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) and atypical glioblastoma. Materials and Methods This retrospective study was institutional review board\u2013approved and informed consent was waived. Pretreatment MR imaging was performed in 314 patients with glioblastoma, and a subset of 28 patients with glioblastoma of atypical appearance (solid enhancement with no visible necrosis) was selected. Parameters of diffusion-weighted (apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC]), susceptibility-weighted (intratumoral susceptibility signals [ITSS]), and dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced perfusion-weighted (relative cerebral blood volume [rCBV]) imaging were evaluated in these 28 patients with glioblastoma and 19 immunocompetent patients with PCNSL. A two-sample t test and \u03c72 test were used to compare parameters.The diagnostic performance for differentiating PCNSL from glioblastoma was evaluated by using logistic regression analyses with leave-one-out cross validation. Results Minimum, maximum, and mean ADCs and maximum and mean rCBVs were significantly lower in patients with PCNSL than in those with glioblastoma (P < .01, respectively), whereas mean ADCs and mean rCBVs allowed the best diagnostic performance. Presence of ITSS was significantly lower in patients with PCNSL (32% [six of 19]) than in those with glioblastoma (82% [23 of 28]) (P < .01). Multiparametric assessment of mean ADC, mean rCBV, and presence of ITSS significantly increased the probability for differentiating PCNSL and atypical glioblastoma compared with the evaluation of one or two imaging parameters (P < .01), thereby correctly predicting histologic results in 95% (18 of 19) of patients with PCNSL and 96% (27 of 28) of patients with atypical glioblastoma. Conclusion Combined evaluation of mean ADC, mean rCBV, and presence of ITSS allowed reliable differentiation of PCNSL and atypical glioblastoma in most patients, and these results support an integration of advanced MR imaging techniques for the routine diagnostic workup of patients with these tumors. \u00a9 RSNA, 2014",

        "Background Results of recent phantom studies show that variation in CT acquisition parameters and reconstruction techniques may make radiomic features largely nonreproduceable and of limited use for prognostic clinical studies. Purpose To investigate the effect of CT radiation dose and reconstruction settings on the reproducibility of radiomic features, as well as to identify correction factors for mitigating these sources of variability. Materials and Methods This was a secondary analysis of a prospective study of metastatic liver lesions in patients who underwent staging with single-energy dual-source contrast material\u2013enhanced staging CT between September 2011 and April 2012. Technique parameters were altered, resulting in 28 CT data sets per patient that included different dose levels, section thicknesses, kernels, and reconstruction algorithm settings. By using a training data set (n = 76), reproducible intensity, shape, and texture radiomic features (reproducibility threshold, R2 \u2265 0.95) were selected and correction factors were calculated by using a linear model to convert each radiomic feature to its estimated value in a reference technique. By using a test data set (n = 75), the reproducibility of hierarchical clustering based on 106 radiomic features measured with different CT techniques was assessed. Results Data in 78 patients (mean age, 60 years \u00b1 10; 33 women) with 151 liver lesions were included. The percentage of radiomic features deemed reproducible for any variation of the different technical parameters was 11% (12 of 106). Of all technical parameters, reconstructed section thickness had the largest impact on the reproducibility of radiomic features (12.3% [13 of 106]) if only one technical parameter was changed while all other technical parameters were kept constant. The results of the hierarchical cluster analysis showed improved clustering reproducibility when reproducible radiomic features with dedicated correction factors were used (\u03c1 = 0.39\u20130.71 vs \u03c1 = 0.14\u20130.47). Conclusion Most radiomic features are highly affected by CT acquisition and reconstruction settings, to the point of being nonreproducible. Selecting reproducible radiomic features along with study-specific correction factors offers improved clustering reproducibility. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Purpose To compare the diagnostic performance of myocardial computed tomographic (CT) perfusion imaging and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) perfusion imaging in the diagnosis of anatomically significant coronary artery disease (CAD) as depicted at invasive coronary angiography. Materials and Methods This study was approved by the institutional review board. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Sixteen centers enrolled 381 patients from November 2009 to July 2011. Patients underwent rest and adenosine stress CT perfusion imaging and rest and either exercise or pharmacologic stress SPECT before and within 60 days of coronary angiography. Images from CT perfusion imaging, SPECT, and coronary angiography were interpreted at blinded, independent core laboratories. The primary diagnostic parameter was the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (Az). Sensitivity and specificity were calculated with use of prespecified cutoffs. The reference standard was a stenosis of at least 50% at coronary angiography as determined with quantitative methods. Results CAD was diagnosed in 229 of the 381 patients (60%). The per-patient sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of CAD (stenosis \u226550%) were 88% (202 of 229 patients) and 55% (83 of 152 patients), respectively, for CT perfusion imaging and 62% (143 of 229 patients) and 67% (102 of 152 patients) for SPECT, with Az values of 0.78 (95% confidence interval: 0.74, 0.82) and 0.69 (95% confidence interval: 0.64, 0.74) (P = .001). The sensitivity of CT perfusion imaging for single- and multivessel CAD was higher than that of SPECT, with sensitivities for left main, three-vessel, two-vessel, and one-vessel disease of 92%, 92%, 89%, and 83%, respectively, for CT perfusion imaging and 75%, 79%, 68%, and 41%, respectively, for SPECT. Conclusion The overall performance of myocardial CT perfusion imaging in the diagnosis of anatomic CAD (stenosis \u226550%), as demonstrated with the Az, was higher than that of SPECT and was driven in part by the higher sensitivity for left main and multivessel disease. \u00a9 RSNA, 2014",
        "Background Multidetector CT (MDCT) enables rapid and accurate diagnosis of head and neck (HN) injuries in patients with blunt trauma (BT). However, MDCT is overused, and appropriate selection of patients for imaging could improve workflow. Purpose To investigate the effect of implementing clinical triaging algorithms on use of MDCT in the HN in patients who have sustained BT. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, patients aged 15 years or older with BT admitted between October 28, 2007, and December 31, 2013, were included. Patients were divided into pre- and postalgorithm groups. The institutional trauma registry and picture archiving and communication system reports were reviewed to determine which patients underwent MDCT of the head, MDCT of the cervical spine (CS), and MDCT angiography of the HN at admission and whether these examinations yielded positive results. Injury Severity Score, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (only those patients in the intensive care unit), length of hospital stay (LOS), length of intensive care unit stay (ICULOS), and mortality were obtained from the trauma registry.

The median patient age was 53 years (range, 22\u201384 years). The median age was 53 years (range, 26\u201384 years) for men and 56 years (range, 22\u201375 years) for women. Propensity score\u2013based methods were used to minimize bias when evaluating TTP on the basis of modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors and OS. Statistical analysis was performed with the Kaplan-Meier method by using the log-rank test and Cox regression models. Results In the combined and monotherapy groups, respectively, 64.6% and 49.2% of patients had vascular invasion, 87.8% and 91.1% had extrahepatic metastasis, and 54.3% and 47.1% had both. During follow-up (median duration, 5.5 months), the median TTP and OS in the combined group were longer than those in the monotherapy group (TTP: 2.5 months vs 2.1 months, respectively, P = .008; OS: 8.9 months vs 5.9 months, P = .009). At univariate and subsequent multivariate analyses, additional TACE was an independent predictor of favorable TTP and OS (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.74 and 0.57, respectively; P < .05 for both), consistent with the outcomes of inverse probability of treatment weighting. In the propensity score\u2013matched cohort (96 pairs), the median TTP in the combined group was significantly longer than that in the monotherapy group (2.7 months vs 2.1 months, respectively; P = .011), but median OS was not (9.1 months vs 6.7 months, P = .21). Conclusion In this retrospective study, TACE plus sorafenib was superior to sorafenib alone with respect to TTP in patients with advanced-stage HCC, although it may or may not improve OS. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Supplemental material: S1",
        "Computed tomography and magnetic resonance enterography have become routine small bowel imaging tests to evaluate patients with established or suspected Crohn's disease, but the interpretation and use of these imaging modalities can vary widely. A shared understanding of imaging findings, nomenclature, and utilization will improve the utility of these imaging techniques to guide treatment options, as well as assess for treatment response and complications. Representatives from the Society of Abdominal Radiology Crohn's Disease-Focused Panel, the Society of Pediatric Radiology, the American Gastroenterological Association, and other experts, systematically evaluated evidence for imaging findings associated with small bowel Crohn's disease enteric inflammation and established recommendations for the evaluation, interpretation, and use of computed tomography and magnetic resonance enterography in small bowel Crohn's disease. This work makes recommendations for imaging findings that indicate small bowel Crohn's disease, how inflammatory small bowel Crohn's disease and its complications should be described, elucidates potential extra-enteric findings that may be seen at imaging, and recommends that cross-sectional enterography should be performed at diagnosis of Crohn's disease and considered for small bowel Crohn's disease monitoring paradigms. A useful morphologic construct describing how imaging findings evolve with disease progression and response is described, and standard impressions for radiologic reports that convey meaningful information to gastroenterologists and surgeons are presented. \u00a92018, RSNA, AGA Institute, and Society of Abdominal Radiology This article is being published jointly in Radiology and Gastroenterology.",
        "History A 21-year-old immunocompetent man who was a long-term resident of Qatar presented to the emergency department with recurrent episodes of unprovoked generalized tonic-clonic seizures lasting 2-3 minutes that spontaneously resolved and were associated with postictal confusion. The patient also had progressive mild diplopia, intermittent dizziness, and numbness in the left arm over the course of 3 months. The patient did not have any other systemic symptoms or chronic medical diseases. He did not have any history of intake of illicit drugs, supplements, or regular medications; he had not received any recent vaccinations; and he had not undergone any surgical procedures. He had no history of travel. At presentation, vital signs were normal. Neurologic examination showed mild left homonymous hemianopia, normal gait with no cerebellar signs, and preserved sensations, power, tone, and reflexes in all four limbs. An electroencephalogram showed no epileptiform discharges. Chest CT and extensive laboratory work-up, including viral, fungal, bacterial, and parasite work-up, thyroid function tests, and immunologic blood tests yielded normal results. Those included normal complete and differential blood counts and normal serum chemistry. Serum analysis was negative for antinuclear antibody, Sj\u00f6gren syndrome antigens A and B, cytoplasmic antineutrophil cvtoplasmic antibody, and paraneoplastic profile. Serum evaluation was also negative for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and type 2 RNA, and Brucella, Schistosoma, and toxoplasma antibodies. Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) and rapid plasma regain (RPR) test results were negative. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed clear fluid and normal pressure and biochemistry, except for elevated protein concentration (0.48 g/L) (normal range, 0.15-0.45 g/L). There were 43 leukocytes/\u00b5L (99% lymphocytes) (normal range, 0-5 leukocytes/\u00b5L; lymphocytes range, 40%-80%), with no atypical or malignant cells. CSF Gram staining, acid-fast staining, cryptococcal antigen, varicella-zoster virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR), herpes simplex virus PCR, VDRL, and RPR test results were negative. CSF cultures did not show any evidence of growth of bacteria, fungi, or acid-fast bacillus. CSF flow cytometry did not show a monoclonal lymphoid population. No CSF oligoclonal bands were detected. Conventional brain MRI with intravenous administration of contrast material and a perfusion study were performed and included different sequences (Figs 1-3).",
        "To compare the accuracy of several magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-based methods for hepatic proton-density fat fraction (FF) estimation at 3.0 T, with spectroscopy as the reference technique.This prospective study was institutional review board approved and HIPAA compliant. Informed consent was obtained. One hundred sixty-three subjects (39 with known hepatic steatosis, 110 with steatosis risk factors, 14 without risk factors) underwent proton MR spectroscopy and non-T1-weighted gradient-echo MR imaging of the liver. At spectroscopy, the reference FF was determined from frequency-selective measurements of fat and water proton densities. At imaging, FF was calculated by using two-, three-, or six-echo methods, with single-frequency and multifrequency fat signal modeling. The three- and six-echo methods corrected for T2*; the two-echo methods did not. For each imaging method, the fat estimation accuracy was assessed by using linear regression between the imaging FF and spectroscopic FF. Binary classification accuracy of imaging was assessed at four reference spectroscopic thresholds (0.04, 0.06, 0.08, and 0.10 FF).Regression intercept of two-, three-, and six-echo methods were -0.0211, 0.0087, and -0.0062 (P <.001 for all three) without multifrequency modeling and -0.0237 (P <.001), 0.0022, and -0.0007 with multifrequency modeling, respectively. Regression slope of two-, three-, and six-echo methods were 0.8522, 0.8528, and 0.7544 (P <.001 for all three) without multifrequency modeling and 0.9994, 0.9775, and 0.9821 with multifrequency modeling, respectively. Significant deviation of intercept and slope from 0 and 1, respectively, indicated systematic error. Classification accuracy was 82.2%-90.1%, 93.9%-96.3%, and 83.4%-89.6% for two-, three-, and six-echo methods without multifrequency modeling and 88.3%-92.0%, 95.1%-96.3%, and 94.5%-96.3% with multifrequency modeling, respectively, depending on the FF threshold. T2*-corrected (three- and six-echo) multifrequency imaging methods had the overall highest FF estimation and classification accuracy. Among methods without multifrequency modeling, the T2-corrected three-echo method had the highest accuracy.Non-T1-weighted MR imaging with T2 correction and multifrequency modeling helps accurately estimate hepatic proton-density FF at 3.0 T.",
        "To compare the relative contributions of rest, stress, and delayed acquisitions with the accuracy of dual-energy (DE) computed tomography (CT) for the assessment of myocardial blood supply.With institutional review board approval and HIPAA compliance, 55 consecutive patients (10 women, 45 men; mean age, 62 years \u00b1 10) clinically referred for cardiac single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) who were known to have or were suspected of having coronary artery disease were prospectively enrolled. DE CT studies were acquired during adenosine stress, at rest, and after 6-minute delay. The DE CT iodine distribution maps were visually assessed for perfusion deficits or late iodine enhancement. Per-segment agreement between modalities was investigated with \u03ba statistics. Test characteristics for the detection of perfusion deficits were calculated for combinations of rest, stress, and delayed DE CT acquisition, with SPECT as reference standard.At SPECT, 714 segments were considered normal, 192 showed fixed perfusion defects, and 29 showed reversible perfusion deficits. Sensitivity of rest-only DE CT was 92%, and specificity was 98%. Stress-only, rest-stress, stress and delayed, and the combination of all three had a sensitivity of 99% and a specificity of 97%. Of 29 segments with reversible perfusion deficits at SPECT, 13 (45%) were misclassified by using rest-stress DE CT as fixed perfusion deficits. With stress DE CT plus delayed acquisition, 13 of 192 (7%) segments with fixed perfusion deficits at SPECT were misclassified as reversible.Rest-stress acquisition should be the protocol of choice for assessment of the myocardial blood supply in DE CT. The accuracy of DE CT is not increased by the addition of a delayed DE CT acquisition, which may therefore be omitted to reduce radiation exposure. With rest-stress DE CT, almost one-half of defects that are reversible at SPECT were classified as fixed; radiologists and clinicians need to be aware of this incongruence when they interpret DE CT myocardial perfusion studies.",
        "Background An iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithm was introduced for clinical photon-counting detector (PCD) CT. Purpose To investigate the image quality and the optimal strength level of a quantum IR algorithm (QIR; Siemens Healthcare) for virtual monoenergetic images and polychromatic images (T3D) in a phantom and in patients undergoing portal venous abdominal PCD CT. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, noise power spectrum (NPS) was measured in a water-filled phantom. Consecutive oncologic patients who underwent portal venous abdominal PCD CT between March and April 2021 were included. Virtual monoenergetic images at 60 keV and T3D were reconstructed without QIR (QIR-off; reference standard) and with QIR at four levels (QIR 1\u20134; index tests). Global noise index, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and voxel-wise CT attenuation differences were measured. Noise and texture, artifacts, diagnostic confidence, and overall quality were assessed qualitatively. Conspicuity of hypodense liver lesions was rated by four readers. Parametric (analyses of variance, paired t tests) and nonparametric tests (Friedman, post hoc Wilcoxon signed-rank tests) were used to compare quantitative and qualitative image quality among reconstructions. Results In the phantom, NPS showed unchanged noise texture across reconstructions with maximum spatial frequency differences of 0.01 per millimeter. Fifty patients (mean age, 59 years \u00b1 16 [standard deviation]; 31 women) were included. Global noise index was reduced from QIR-off to QIR-4 by 45% for 60 keV and by 44% for T3D (both, P < .001). CNR of the liver improved from QIR-off to QIR-4 by 74% for 60 keV and by 69% for T3D (both, P < .001). No evidence of difference was found in mean attenuation of fat and liver (P = .79\u2013.84) and on a voxel-wise basis among reconstructions. Qualitatively, QIR-4 outperformed all reconstructions in every category for 60 keV and T3D (P value range, <.001 to .01). All four readers rated QIR-4 superior to other strengths for lesion conspicuity (P value range, <.001 to .04). Conclusion In portal venous abdominal photon-counting detector CT, an iterative reconstruction algorithm (QIR; Siemens Healthcare) at high strength levels improved image quality by reducing noise and improving contrast-to-noise ratio and lesion conspicuity without compromising image texture or CT attenuation values. \u00a9 RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "To determine if a correlation exists between the number of previous enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging examinations and high signal intensity in the globus pallidus (GP) and dentate nucleus (DN) in patients who received gadodiamide (Omniscan), a linear nonionic gadolinium-based contrast agent, and in those who received gadobenate dimeglumine (MultiHance), a linear ionic contrast agent.Institutional review board approval was obtained for this single-center retrospective study, with waiver of informed consent. The study population included 69 patients divided into two groups: Group 1 included patients who underwent gadodiamide-enhanced MR imaging, and group 2 included patients who underwent gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced MR imaging. Two radiologists conducted a quantitative analysis of unenhanced T1-weighted images by using region of interest measurements. The GP-to-thalamus (TH) signal intensity ratio, DN-to-middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP) signal intensity ratio and relative percentage change (Rchange) between the first and last examinations for each patient were calculated. Relation between the signal intensity ratios and Rchange and the number of enhanced MR imaging examinations was analyzed by using a generalized additive model. Inter- and intraobserver agreement was evaluated with the Lin concordance correlation coefficient test.Group 1 included 23 patients (19 female), with a mean of 5.0 doses \u00b1 2.4 (standard deviation) (range, 3-11 doses) administered. Group 2 included 46 patients (24 female) with a mean of 4.6 doses \u00b1 2.2 (range, 3-11 doses) administered. The interval between the first and last examination was 1500.1 days \u00b1 780.2 (range, 98-3097 days) for group 1 and 1086.2 days \u00b1 582.9 (range, 94-2633) for group 2. All patients had normal liver and renal function. Gadodiamide showed a significant increase in DN:MCP and GP:TH (P < .001 for both) and in Rchange (P = .001 for GP:TH, P < .001 for DN:MCP). In group 2, there was no significant increase in DN:MCP or GP:TH over time or in Rchange for GP:TH, but there was a significant trend toward an increase in Rchange for DN:MCP (P = .013). Interobserver agreement was almost perfect (0.99; 95% confidence interval: 0.99, 0.99) for all evaluated structures. Intraobserver agreement was substantial to almost perfect for both readers.A significant increase in GP:TH and DN:MCP is associated with multiple gadodiamide-enhanced studies but not with gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced studies, likely reflecting differences in stability and elimination of both contrast agents. Rate-of-change data indirectly suggest gadolinium deposition in the DN with gadobenate dimeglumine use, although it is considerably less than that with gadodiamide use.",
        "Background Ultra-low-dose (ULD) CT could facilitate the clinical implementation of large-scale lung cancer screening while minimizing the radiation dose. However, traditional image reconstruction methods are associated with image noise in low-dose acquisitions. Purpose To compare the image quality and lung nodule detectability of deep learning image reconstruction (DLIR) and adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction-V (ASIR-V) in ULD CT. Materials and Methods Patients who underwent noncontrast ULD CT (performed at 0.07 or 0.14 mSv, similar to a single chest radiograph) and contrast-enhanced chest CT (CECT) from April to June 2020 were included in this prospective study. ULD CT images were reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP), ASIR-V, and DLIR. Three-dimensional segmentation of lung tissue was performed to evaluate image noise. Radiologists detected and measured nodules with use of a deep learning-based nodule assessment system and recognized malignancy-related imaging features. Bland-Altman analysis and repeated-measures analysis of variance were used to evaluate the differences between ULD CT images and CECT images. Results A total of 203 participants (mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 61 years \u00b1 12; 129 men) with 1066 nodules were included, with 100 scans at 0.07 mSv and 103 scans at 0.14 mSv. The mean lung tissue noise \u00b1 standard deviation was 46 HU \u00b1 4 for CECT and 59 HU \u00b1 4, 56 HU \u00b1 4, 53 HU \u00b1 4, 54 HU \u00b1 4, and 51 HU \u00b1 4 in FBP, ASIR-V level 40%, ASIR-V level 80% (ASIR-V-80%), medium-strength DLIR, and high-strength DLIR (DLIR-H), respectively, of ULD CT scans (P < .001). The nodule detection rates of FBP reconstruction, ASIR-V-80%, and DLIR-H were 62.5% (666 of 1066 nodules), 73.3% (781 of 1066 nodules), and 75.8% (808 of 1066 nodules), respectively (P < .001). Bland-Altman analysis showed the percentage difference in long diameter from that of CECT was 9.3% (95% CI of the mean: 8.0, 10.6), 9.2% (95% CI of the mean: 8.0, 10.4), and 6.2% (95% CI of the mean: 5.0, 7.4) in FBP reconstruction, ASIR-V-80%, and DLIR-H, respectively (P < .001). Conclusion Compared with adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction-V, deep learning image reconstruction reduced image noise, increased nodule detection rate, and improved measurement accuracy on ultra-low-dose chest CT images. \u00a9 RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "To (a) use a new second-generation wide-volume 320-detector row computed tomographic (CT) scanner to explore optimization of radiation exposure in coronary CT angiography in an unselected and consecutive cohort of patients referred for clinical purposes and (b) compare estimated radiation exposure and image quality with that from a cohort of similar patients who underwent imaging with a previous first-generation CT system.The study was approved by the institutional review board, and all subjects provided written consent. Coronary CT angiography was performed in 107 consecutive patients with a new second-generation 320-detector row unit. Estimated radiation exposure and image quality were compared with those from 100 consecutive patients who underwent imaging with a previous first-generation scanner. Effective radiation dose was estimated by multiplying the dose-length product by an effective dose conversion factor of 0.014 mSv/mGy \u22c5 cm and reported with size-specific dose estimates (SSDEs). Image quality was evaluated by two independent readers.The mean age of the 107 patients was 55.4 years \u00b1 12.0 (standard deviation); 57 patients (53.3%) were men. The median body mass index was 27.3 kg/m(2) (range, 18.1-47.2 kg/m(2)); however, 71 patients (66.4%) were overweight, obese, or morbidly obese. A tube potential of 100 kV was used in 97 patients (90.6%), single-volume acquisition was used in 104 (97.2%), and prospective electrocardiographic gating was used in 106 (99.1%). The mean heart rate was 57.1 beats per minute \u00b1 11.2 (range, 34-96 beats per minute), which enabled single-heartbeat scans in 100 patients (93.4%). The median radiation dose was 0.93 mSv (interquartile range [IQR], 0.58-1.74 mSv) with the second-generation unit and 2.67 mSv (IQR, 1.68-4.00 mSv) with the first-generation unit (P < .0001). The median SSDE was 6.0 mGy (IQR, 4.1-10.0 mGy) with the second-generation unit and 13.2 mGy (IQR, 10.2-18.6 mGy) with the first-generation unit (P < .0001). Overall, the radiation dose was less than 0.5 mSv for 23 of the 107 CT angiography examinations (21.5%), less than 1 mSv for 58 (54.2%), and less than 4 mSv for 103 (96.3%). All studies were of diagnostic quality, with most having excellent image quality. Three of four image quality indexes were significantly better with the second-generation unit compared with the first-generation unit.The combination of a gantry rotation time of 275 msec, wide volume coverage, iterative reconstruction, automated exposure control, and larger x-ray power generator of the second-generation CT scanner provides excellent image quality over a wide range of body sizes and heart rates at low radiation doses.http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.13122621/-/DC1.",
        "Background Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and its consequences are a growing public health concern requiring cross-sectional imaging for noninvasive diagnosis and quantification of liver fat. Purpose To investigate a deep learning\u2013based automated liver fat quantification tool at nonenhanced CT for establishing the prevalence of steatosis in a large screening cohort. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, a fully automated liver segmentation algorithm was applied to noncontrast abdominal CT examinations from consecutive asymptomatic adults by using three-dimensional convolutional neural networks, including a subcohort with follow-up scans. Automated volume-based liver attenuation was analyzed, including conversion to CT fat fraction, and compared with manual measurement in a large subset of scans. Results A total of 11 669 CT scans in 9552 adults (mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 57.2 years \u00b1 7.9; 5314 women and 4238 men; median body mass index [BMI], 27.8 kg/m2) were evaluated, including 2117 follow-up scans in 1862 adults (mean age, 59.2 years; 971 women and 891 men; mean interval, 5.5 years). Algorithm failure occurred in seven scans. Mean CT liver attenuation was 55 HU \u00b1 10, corresponding to CT fat fraction of 6.4% (slightly fattier in men than in women [7.4% \u00b1 6.0 vs 5.8% \u00b1 5.7%; P < .001]). Mean liver Hounsfield unit varied little by age (<4 HU difference among all age groups) and only weak correlation was seen with BMI (r2 = 0.14). By category, 47.9% (5584 of 11 669) had negligible or no liver fat (CT fat fraction <5%), 42.4% (4948 of 11 669) had mild steatosis (CT fat fraction of 5%\u201314%), 8.8% (1025 of 11 669) had moderate steatosis (CT fat fraction of 14%\u201328%), and 1% (112 of 11 669) had severe steatosis (CT fat fraction >28%). Excellent agreement was seen between automated and manual measurements, with a mean difference of 2.7 HU (median, 3 HU) and r2 of 0.92. Among the subcohort with longitudinal follow-up, mean change was only \u22123 HU \u00b1 9, but 43.3% (806 of 1861) of patients changed steatosis category between first and last scans. Conclusion This fully automated CT-based liver fat quantification tool allows for population-based assessment of hepatic steatosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, with objective data that match well with manual measurement. The prevalence of at least mild steatosis was greater than 50% in this asymptomatic screening cohort. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019",
        "Purpose To determine if adding shear-wave elastography (SWE) to second-look ultrasonography (US) after breast dynamic contrast material\u2013enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging helps find or target lesions seen on DCE MR images for US-guided biopsy. Materials and Methods This HIPAA-compliant prospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained from patients. From May 2011 to July 2012, 73 women with 96 Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) category 4 or 5 lesions after DCE MR imaging prospectively consented to undergo SWE during second-look US. If a lesion was not confidently seen with B-mode US, SWE during real-time scanning was performed to determine if SWE helped find or target lesions for US biopsy. A qualitative SWE six-point color scale was used to record the maximum elasticity in and around lesions. All lesions underwent US or DCE MR imaging\u2013guided core biopsy. Results Median participant age was 52 years (range, 21\u201381 years). In 72 patients who underwent DCE MR imaging, 96 BI-RADS category 4 or 5 lesions were detected in 81 breasts. There were 29 (30%) malignancies (one malignancy was of nonbreast origin), 14 (15%) high-risk lesions, and 53 (55%) benign lesions. US revealed 22 cancers, and seven cancers were detected only with MR imaging. Real-time SWE helped find one lesion and target four lesions that were incompletely assessed with gray-scale US. These five lesions that were localized or targeted for biopsy were invasive cancers, representing 23% of the 22 malignancies detected with US. Conclusion Real-time SWE added to second-look US after DCE MR imaging increased the detection rate of cancers and helped target cancers for US-guided biopsy. \u00a9 RSNA, 2014",
        "To assess the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and interobserver reliability of subtraction, color-encoded subtraction, and parallel display formats in assessing signal intensity (SI) differences between well-registered images.Institutional ethics approval for the study and a waiver of individual patient consent were obtained. Five radiologists graded the severity of fatty liver by using a seven-point scale for four imaging sets created from 179 pairs of dual-echo in- and opposed-phase magnetic resonance images from 179 patients. The four sets contained images displayed in parallel, subtraction images, color-encoded subtraction images, and images from the three previous formats presented together. The order of the images and sets was randomized. Sensitivity and specificity were assessed with the McNemar test. Accuracy was assessed by using three-way analysis of variance, with Tukey post hoc methods used to assess differences between the four formats. Interobserver reliability was assessed by using the Fleiss \u03ba value.Subtraction (P = .016 at a 5% SI difference threshold) and color-encoded subtraction (P = .031 at a 4% SI difference threshold) formats had higher sensitivity than did the parallel format. The accuracy of the subtraction format was superior to that of the parallel format (P < .0001). Interobserver reliability of the subtraction (\u03ba = 0.53) and color-encoded subtraction (\u03ba = 0.39) formats was superior to that of the parallel format (\u03ba = 0.33) (P < .0001 and P = .0085, respectively).When images are well registered, subtraction and color-encoded subtraction techniques offer advantages over the traditional parallel presentation format for the assessment of SI differences.",
        "To use inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) to evaluate gadolinium accumulation in brain tissues, including the dentate nucleus (DN) and globus pallidus (GP), in subjects who received a gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA).Institutional review board approval was obtained for this study. Written informed consent for postmortem investigation was obtained either from the subject prior to his or her death or afterward from the subject's relatives. Brain tissues obtained at autopsy in five subjects who received a linear GBCA (GBCA group) and five subjects with no history of GBCA administration (non-GBCA group) were examined with ICP-MS. Formalin-fixed DN tissue, the inner segment of the GP, cerebellar white matter, the frontal lobe cortex, and frontal lobe white matter were obtained, and their gadolinium concentrations were measured. None of the subjects had received a diagnosis of severely compromised renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate <45 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) or acute renal failure. Fisher permutation test was used to compare gadolinium concentrations between the two groups and among brain regions.Gadolinium was detected in all specimens in the GBCA agent group (mean, 0.25 \u00b5g per gram of brain tissue \u00b1 0.44 [standard deviation]), with significantly higher concentrations in each region (P = .004 vs the non-GBCA group for all regions). In the GBCA group, the DN and GP showed significantly higher gadolinium concentrations (mean, 0.44 \u00b5g/g \u00b1 0.63) than other regions (0.12 \u00b5g/g \u00b1 0.16) (P = .029).Even in subjects without severe renal dysfunction, GBCA administration causes gadolinium accumulation in the brain, especially in the DN and GP.",

Materials and Methods Study design and implementation were overseen by an institutional review board and conformed to HIPAA guidelines on patient data integrity. All patients who underwent an iodixanol-enhanced (IOCM group) or a noncontrast (noncontrast group) CT examination from January 2003 to December 2014 were identified. Patients were subdivided into subgroups of those with stage 1\u20132 chronic kidney disease (CKD) (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], \u2265 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), those with stage 3 CKD (eGFR, 30\u201359 mL/min/1.73 m2), and those with stage 4\u20135 CKD (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and separately underwent propensity score stratification and matching. Rates of AKI, emergent dialysis, and mortality were compared between IOCM and noncontrast groups. Additional analyses incorporating intravenous fluid administration, including additional CT studies at other sites within a single institution, and a paired analysis of patients who underwent both IOCM and noncontrast CT studies during the study time frame, were also performed. Results A total of 5758 patients (1538 with stage 1\u20132 CKD, 2899 with stage 3 CKD, and 1321 with stage 4\u20135 CKD) were included in the study. After propensity score adjustment, rates of AKI, dialysis, and mortality were not significantly higher in the IOCM group compared with the noncontrast group for all CKD subgroups (AKI odds ratios [ORs], 0.74\u20130.91, P = .16\u20130.69; dialysis ORs, 0.74\u20132.00, P = .42\u2013.76; mortality ORs, 0.98\u20131.24, P = .39\u2013.88). Sensitivity analyses yielded similar results. Conclusion Among patients at the highest perceived risk of postcontrast AKI, intravenous administration of iodixanol for contrast material enhanced CT was not an independent risk factor for AKI, dialysis, or mortality. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "History A 70-year-old man was referred to our institution with chronic obstructive urinary symptoms and constipation for 2 years before admission. His medical history was unremarkable. Outside laboratory tests revealed an elevated serum prostate-specific antigen level (21.7 ng/mL [normal range, 0.00\u20134.00 ng/mL]), and urinalysis results were negative. He was admitted for evaluation of possible prostate cancer. The patient reported no specific symptoms of infection and denied fever, dysuria, hematuria, and abdominal pain. He had no family history of prostate cancer. On physical examination, he was afebrile, and the digital rectal examination was not painful. These findings were evidence of an enlarged prostate and a hard multilobulated mass, which was palpable bilaterally. The urologic team performed MRI of the prostate (Figs 1\u20134)",
        "To systematically investigate structural and functional alterations of the thalamus and its subregions through a multimodal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging technique and examine its clinical relevance in multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica (NMO).The institutional review board approved this study, and written informed consent was obtained from each participant. Thirty-seven patients with MS, 39 patients with NMO, and 40 healthy control subjects were recruited. Six MR imaging measurements were obtained for each participant and compared between groups in the thalamus and its seven subregions, including gray matter (GM) volume, fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation, cross-correlation coefficient of spontaneous low frequency, and weighted functional connectivity strength. Partial correlation was used to estimate the MR imaging-clinical relationships.Both MS and NMO exhibited widespread GM atrophy (GM volume in MS, 0.244; NMO, 0.297; and control subjects, 0.329; P < .001) and diffusion abnormalities (fractional anisotropy in MS, 0.293; NMO, 0.323; and control subjects, 0.355; P < .001) in the whole thalamus and several subregions, while MS showed more severe changes than NMO. Decreased cross-correlation coefficient of spontaneous low-frequency and weighted functional connectivity strength was observed in several thalamus subregions in MS (P < .05), but no significant functional abnormalities were identified in NMO. GM volume, fractional anisotropy, and mean diffusivity, not functional changes of the thalamus and thalamic subregions, correlated with the patients' clinical variables and exhibited high discriminative power in distinguishing the three groups.Similar patterns of thalamic structural alteration were identified in MS and NMO, but MS showed more severe pathologic changes. The thalamus is a key node for functional disconnection in MS but not in NMO.",
        "To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Pipeline Embolization Device (PED; ev3/Covidien, Irvine, Calif) in the treatment of complex intracranial aneurysms.The Pipeline for Uncoilable or Failed Aneurysms is a multicenter, prospective, interventional, single-arm trial of PED for the treatment of uncoilable or failed aneurysms of the internal carotid artery. Institutional review board approval of the HIPAA-compliant study protocol was obtained from each center. After providing informed consent, 108 patients with recently unruptured large and giant wide-necked aneurysms were enrolled in the study. The primary effectiveness endpoint was angiographic evaluation that demonstrated complete aneurysm occlusion and absence of major stenosis at 180 days. The primary safety endpoint was occurrence of major ipsilateral stroke or neurologic death at 180 days.PED placement was technically successful in 107 of 108 patients (99.1%). Mean aneurysm size was 18.2 mm; 22 aneurysms (20.4%) were giant (>25 mm). Of the 106 aneurysms, 78 met the study's primary effectiveness endpoint (73.6%; 95% posterior probability interval: 64.4%-81.0%). Six of the 107 patients in the safety cohort experienced a major ipsilateral stroke or neurologic death (5.6%; 95% posterior probability interval: 2.6%-11.7%).PED offers a reasonably safe and effective treatment of large or giant intracranial internal carotid artery aneurysms, demonstrated by high rates of complete aneurysm occlusion and low rates of adverse neurologic events; even in aneurysms failing previous alternative treatments.",
        "History An 8-month-old previously healthy boy was referred to our institution by the maternal child health center for progressive truncal hypotonia and developmental delay. This infant was born after an uncomplicated pregnancy with no perinatal complications. He was delivered at full term via spontaneous vaginal delivery. Two of his older male siblings died around 2\u20133 years of age due to pneumonia. According to the parents, these siblings also displayed reduced muscle tone, and one of them developed recurrent seizure. On physical examination, the child showed marked head lag and did not reach out to objects. Visual and auditory development were normal. His head circumference was below the third percentile, and his body weight was at the 10th percentile. His hair was sparse and coarse. A mild pectus excavatum deformity was present.

        "Purpose To determine whether venous wall thickness and hoop (circumferential) stress, as determined with high-frequency ultrasonography (US), can predict cannulation readiness in arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs). Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained for this prospective study. To determine the US appearance of the venous wall, an AVF specimen was excised and scanned in a bath of degassed lactated Ringer solution with a 55-MHz probe. The appearance of the wall at high-frequency US was correlated with histologic findings. High-frequency (40\u201355-MHz) US was used to image the near-field AVF venous wall of 14 men (mean age, 59 years \u00b1 11 [standard deviation]) and six women (mean age, 55 years \u00b1 14) with newly created AVFs within 1 week of cannulation between January 2008 and December 2009. Measurements of the intima-media thickness (IMT) were generated by three independent observers who were blinded to outcomes. Intraclass correlation analysis was performed. Cannulation readiness was defined as no extravasation during the first dialysis treatment. Results By using high-frequency US, the IMT was defined as the sum of a thin echogenic blood-intima interface and a uniform hypoechoic media. The mean IMT of the no extravasation group (0.16 mm \u00b1 0.03) was greater than that of the extravasation group (0.10 mm \u00b1 0.02) (P < .001). A minimum threshold IMT of 0.13 mm (P < .001) was associated with successful cannulation. The mean hoop stress of the no extravasation group (246 kPa \u00b1 57) was lower than that of the extravasation group (530 kPa \u00b1 199) (P < .001). A maximum hoop stress threshold of 248 kPa was associated with successful cannulation (P = .009). Conclusion Venous IMT and hoop stress assessed with high-frequency US can predict cannulation readiness in AVFs that are clinically deemed mature. \u00a9 RSNA, 2011",
        "Purpose To investigate the diagnostic accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC]) of magnetic resonance (MR) elastography for the early detection of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) among patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Materials and Methods An institutional review board\u2013approved and HIPAA-compliant retrospective study was conducted in 58 NAFLD patients. Informed consent was waived by the review board. Hepatic stiffness, relative fat fraction, inflammation grade, and fibrosis stage were assessed from MR elastography, in-phase and out-of-phase gradient-echo imaging, and liver biopsy histopathologic review, respectively. Pairwise t testing, receiver operating characteristic analysis, and partial correlation analysis were performed. Results The mean hepatic stiffness for patients with simple steatosis (2.51 kPa) was less (P = .028) than that for patients with inflammation but no fibrosis (3.24 kPa). The mean hepatic stiffness for patients with inflammation but no fibrosis was less (P = .030) than that for patients with hepatic fibrosis (4.16 kPa). Liver stiffness had high accuracy (AUROC = 0.93) for discriminating patients with NASH from those with simple steatosis, with a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity 73% by using a threshold of 2.74 kPa. Conclusion In patients with NAFLD, hepatic stiffness measurements with MR elastography can help identify individuals with steatohepatitis, even before the onset of fibrosis; NAFLD patients with inflammation but no fibrosis have greater liver stiffness than those with simple steatosis and lower mean stiffness than those with fibrosis. \u00a9 RSNA, 2011",

        "A 49-year-old man presented with right foot drop, bilateral cruralgia mainly on the left side, and genital and perianal hypoesthesia, which started suddenly 12 days before. After onset of symptoms, the patient also experienced an accidental fall at home, resulting in a left fibular fracture, which was treated with reduction and with seven-hole plate Synthes Locking Compression Plate at the orthopedic clinic. The neurologic examination showed paresthesias on the posterior aspect of both thighs and crural regions that was worse on the left side, hypoesthesia in the L5 root region on the right side, and right foot drop. There was no urinary retention or fecal incontinence. The patient denied past surgery, back trauma, heavy manual labor, hypermobility, or any other remarkable medical history. The patient was afebrile. Laboratory results on the 1st day of hospitalization showed increased C-reactive protein level (0.62 mg/dL; reference range, 0.0-0.5 mg/dL), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (60 mm/h; reference range, 0-20 mm/h), and increased aspartate transaminase (38 U/L [0.63 \u03bckat/L]; reference range, 0-31 U/L [0-0.52 \u03bckat/L]), alanine transaminase (70 U/L [1.17 \u03bckat/L]; reference range, 0-31 U/L [0-0.52 \u03bckat/L]), and high lymphocyte (4.55 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL; reference range, [1.0-3.0] \u00d7 103/\u03bcL), and neutrophil (8.79 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL; reference range, [2.0-7.0] \u00d7 103/\u03bcL) levels.

        "Purpose To compare the diagnostic accuracy of fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) in the detection of colon lesions with that of delayed PET/computed tomography (CT) performed after the administration of a laxative-augmented contrast medium. Materials and Methods All patients gave written informed consent according to the guidelines issued by the institutional review board. In a prospective study performed from November 2005 to December 2006, images obtained in 847 patients were reviewed by two physicians in consensus. Colorectal FDG uptake on initial PET images that exceeded background FDG accumulation was graded as minimal, equivocal, or positive. When the initial PET scan revealed a colorectal region of increased uptake, either oral or anal laxative-augmented contrast medium was administered on the basis of the site of colorectal FDG focus and delayed PET/CT was performed. Initial PET findings were reevaluated and revised when necessary. Comparison was performed on a per-patient basis. Findings at histopathologic analysis and clinical follow-up served as the reference standard. The accuracy of PET was compared with that of PET/CT by using the McNemar test. Results Colorectal FDG foci were seen on initial images in 137 patients. Uptake on the initial images was reported as minimal in 14 patients, equivocal in 68, and positive in 55. With use of a laxative-augmented contrast medium and delayed PET/CT, the proportions of equivocal and positive results decreased by 84% (57 of 68 patients) and 58% (18 of 31 patients), respectively. The accuracy of delayed PET/CT in the depiction of colorectal cancer was greater than that of initial PET (93.4% [128 of 137 patients] vs 71.5% [98 of 137 patients], respectively; P < .01). Conclusion Delayed PET/CT with laxative-augmented contrast medium is more accurate than initial PET alone in the detection of colorectal cancer. This approach has promise as a tool for guiding decisions about how to treat patients with colorectal FDG foci. \u00a9 RSNA, 2011 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.11101193/-/DC1",
        "Purpose To determine the relationship between hepatic uptake at preoperative fluorine 18 (18F) fluorocholine combined positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) and the histopathologic features of chronic liver disease in patients with Child-Pugh class A or B disease who are undergoing hepatic resection for liver cancer. Materials and Methods Forty-eight patients with resectable liver tumors underwent preoperative 18F fluorocholine PET/CT. Mean liver standardized uptake value (SUVmean) measurements were obtained from PET images, while histologic indexes of inflammation and fibrosis were applied to nontumor liver tissue from resection specimens. Effects of histopathologic features on liver SUVmean were examined with analysis of variance. Results Liver SUVmean ranged from 4.3 to 11.6, correlating significantly with Knodell histologic activity index (\u03c1 = -0.81, P < .001) and several clinical indexes of liver disease severity. Liver SUVmean also differed significantly across groups stratified by necroinflammatory severity and Metavir fibrosis stage (P < . 001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for 18F fluorocholine PET/CT detecting Metavir fibrosis stage F1 or higher was 0.89 \u00b1 0.05, with an odds-ratio of 3.03 (95% confidence interval: 1.59, 5.88) and sensitivity and specificity of 82% and 93%, respectively. Conclusion Correlations found in patients undergoing hepatic resection for liver cancer between liver 18F fluorocholine uptake and histopathologic indexes of liver fibrosis and inflammation support the use of 18F fluorocholine PET/CT as a potential imaging biomarker for chronic liver disease. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018.",
        "Osteoporosis is becoming an increasingly important public health issue, and effective treatments to prevent fragility fractures are available. Osteoporosis imaging is of critical importance in identifying individuals at risk for fractures who would require pharmacotherapy to reduce fracture risk and also in monitoring response to treatment. Dual x-ray absorptiometry is currently the state-of-the-art technique to measure bone mineral density and to diagnose osteoporosis according to the World Health Organization guidelines. Motivated by a 2000 National Institutes of Health consensus conference, substantial research efforts have focused on assessing bone quality by using advanced imaging techniques. Among these techniques aimed at better characterizing fracture risk and treatment effects, high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (CT) currently plays a central role, and a large number of recent studies have used this technique to study trabecular and cortical bone architecture. Other techniques to analyze bone quality include multidetector CT, magnetic resonance imaging, and quantitative ultrasonography. In addition to quantitative imaging techniques measuring bone density and quality, imaging needs to be used to diagnose prevalent osteoporotic fractures, such as spine fractures on chest radiographs and sagittal multidetector CT reconstructions. Radiologists need to be sensitized to the fact that the presence of fragility fractures will alter patient care, and these fractures need to be described in the report. This review article covers state-of-the-art imaging techniques to measure bone mineral density, describes novel techniques to study bone quality, and focuses on how standard imaging techniques should be used to diagnose prevalent osteoporotic fractures. \u00a9 RSNA, 2012",
        "To determine if repeated intravenous exposures to gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are associated with neuronal tissue deposition.In this institutional review board-approved single-center study, signal intensities from T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images and postmortem neuronal tissue samples from 13 patients who underwent at least four GBCA-enhanced brain MR examinations between 2000 and 2014 (contrast group) were compared with those from 10 patients who did not receive GBCA (control group). Antemortem consent was obtained from all study participants. Neuronal tissues from the dentate nuclei, pons, globus pallidus, and thalamus of these 23 deceased patients were harvested and analyzed with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), transmission electron microscopy, and light microscopy to quantify, localize, and assess the effects of gadolinium deposition. Associations between cumulative gadolinium dose, changes in T1-weighted MR signal intensity, and ICP-MS-derived tissue gadolinium concentrations were examined by using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient (\u03c1).Compared with neuronal tissues of control patients, all of which demonstrated undetectable levels of gadolinium, neuronal tissues of patients from the contrast group contained 0.1-58.8 \u03bcg gadolinium per gram of tissue, in a significant dose-dependent relationship that correlated with signal intensity changes on precontrast T1-weighted MR images (\u03c1 = 0.49-0.93). All patients in the contrast group had relatively normal renal function at the time of MR examination. Gadolinium deposition in the capillary endothelium and neural interstitium was observed only in the contrast group.Intravenous GBCA exposure is associated with neuronal tissue deposition in the setting of relatively normal renal function. Additional studies are needed to investigate the clinical significance of these findings and the generalizability to other GBCAs. Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To evaluate the predictive value of imaging and clinical and physiological measurements of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) in patients monitored for more than 5 years for pulmonary exacerbations that required hospitalization. Materials and Methods Exacerbations requiring hospitalization were monitored over 5 years in 91 subjects who provided written informed consent. Study was local research ethics board and Health Canada approved and HIPAA compliant. Subjects with COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease underwent spirometry, plethysmography, diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide, St George's Respiratory Questionnaire, 6-minute walk test, and imaging. Computed tomographic (CT) wall area and relative area with attenuation values less than \u2212950 HU ( RA950relative area with attenuation values less than \u2212950 HU ), helium 3 (3He) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging ventilation defect percentage ( VDP ventilation defect percentage ), and apparent diffusion coefficient were generated. Zero-inflated Poisson model was used to compare number of hospitalizations with lung function and imaging measurements. Results Twenty-four subjects were hospitalized 58 times and had significantly worse forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV1forced expiratory volume in 1 second ) (P < .0001), CT RA950relative area with attenuation values less than \u2212950 HU (P = .02), and 3He VDP ventilation defect percentage (P < .0001) than values in 67 subjects who were not hospitalized. In mild to moderate COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , nine hospitalized subjects had significantly worse FEV1forced expiratory volume in 1 second (P = .02) and 3He VDP ventilation defect percentage (P = .02) than values in 52 subjects who were not hospitalized. 3He VDP ventilation defect percentage was quantitatively related to CT airway morphology (r = 0.26, P = .01) and quantitatively (r = 0.61, P < .0001) and spatially related to emphysema; this spatial relationship was significantly greater for hospitalized patients with COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease than unhospitalized patients (P = .0006). For all subjects, number of prior hospitalizations (P < .0001), 6-minute walk test distance (P < .0001), CT RA950relative area with attenuation values less than \u2212950 HU (P = .03), and 3He VDP ventilation defect percentage (P = .002) were significantly related to number of hospitalizations. For 61 subjects with mild to moderate COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , only 3He VDP ventilation defect percentage was significantly associated with COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations (P = .01). Conclusion 3He MR imaging VDP ventilation defect percentage represents a mixed airways\u2013emphysema phenotype and helps identify subjects with mild to moderate COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who are at risk for exacerbation that requires hospitalization. \u00a9 RSNA, 2014",
        "History A 36-year-old left-handed woman with a history of developmental delay and medical refractory seizures since birth most recently presented with continuous simple partial seizures and occasional breakthrough complex partial seizures with postictal migraines. These were described as the patient \u201cbecoming pale with sinking to the floor and staring for approximately 1 minute with confusion thereafter.\u201d The patient had years of reported seizure freedom until 2010 when she was evaluated for intractable headaches, and electroencephalography revealed her focal subclinical status.

        "Background Evaluation of interstitial lung disease (ILD) at CT is a challenging task that requires experience and is subject to substantial interreader variability. Purpose To investigate whether a proposed content-based image retrieval (CBIR) of similar chest CT images by using deep learning can aid in the diagnosis of ILD by readers with different levels of experience. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included patients with confirmed ILD after multidisciplinary discussion and available CT images identified between January 2000 and December 2015. Database was composed of four disease classes: usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, and chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Eighty patients were selected as queries from the database. The proposed CBIR retrieved the top three similar CT images with diagnosis from the database by comparing the extent and distribution of different regional disease patterns quantified by a deep learning algorithm. Eight readers with varying experience interpreted the query CT images and provided their most probable diagnosis in two reading sessions 2 weeks apart, before and after applying CBIR. Diagnostic accuracy was analyzed by using McNemar test and generalized estimating equation, and interreader agreement was analyzed by using Fleiss \u03ba. Results A total of 288 patients were included (mean age, 58 years \u00b1 11 [standard deviation]; 145 women). After applying CBIR, the overall diagnostic accuracy improved in all readers (before CBIR, 46.1% [95% CI: 37.1, 55.3]; after CBIR, 60.9% [95% CI: 51.8, 69.3]; P < .001). In terms of disease category, the diagnostic accuracy improved after applying CBIR in UIP (before vs after CBIR, 52.4% vs 72.8%, respectively; P < .001) and NSIP cases (before vs after CBIR, 42.9% vs 61.6%, respectively; P < .001). Interreader agreement improved after CBIR (before vs after CBIR Fleiss \u03ba, 0.32 vs 0.47, respectively; P = .005). Conclusion The proposed content-based image retrieval system for chest CT images with deep learning improved the diagnostic accuracy of interstitial lung disease and interreader agreement in readers with different levels of experience. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Background Corticosteroids injected for the treatment of musculoskeletal pain are systemically absorbed and can affect the immune response to viral infections. Purpose To determine the incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 disease in individuals receiving image-guided corticosteroid injections for musculoskeletal pain compared with the general population during the pandemic recovery period. Materials and Methods In this prospective cohort multicenter study, adults with a history of musculoskeletal pain who underwent imaging-guided intra-articular and spine corticosteroid injections from April 2020 to February 2021 were consecutively enrolled. Participants were followed for a minimum of 28 days through their electronic medical record (EMR) or by direct phone communication to screen for COVID-19 test results or symptoms. Clinical data, including body mass index (BMI), were also obtained from the EMR. The incidence of COVID-19 in the state was obtained using the Massachusetts COVID-19 Response Reporting website. The Student t test was used for continuous variable comparisons. Univariable analyses were performed using the Fisher exact test. Results A total of 2714 corticosteroid injections were performed in 2190 adult participants (mean age, 59 years \u00b1 15 [SD]; 1031 women). Follow-up was available for 1960 participants (89%) who received 2484 injections. Follow-up occurred a mean of 97 days \u00b1 33 (range, 28-141 days) after the injection. Of the 1960 participants, 10 had COVID-19 within 28 days from the injection (0.5% [95% CI: 0.24, 0.94]) and 43 had COVID-19 up to 4 months after the injection (2.2% [95% CI: 1.6, 2.9]). These incidence rates were lower than that of the population of Massachusetts during the same period (519 195 of 6 892 503 [7.5%], P < .001 for both 28 days and 4 months).

        "To compare accuracy, precision, and reproducibility of four commonly used myocardial T1 mapping sequences: modified Look-Locker inversion recovery (MOLLI), shortened MOLLI (ShMOLLI), saturation recovery single-shot acquisition (SASHA), and saturation pulse prepared heart rate independent inversion recovery (SAPPHIRE).This HIPAA-compliant study was approved by the institutional review board. All subjects provided written informed consent. Accuracy, precision, and reproducibility of the four T1 mapping sequences were first compared in phantom experiments. In vivo analysis was performed in seven healthy subjects (mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 38 years \u00b1 19; four men, three women) who were imaged twice on two separate days. In vivo reproducibility of native T1 mapping and extracellular volume (ECV) were measured. Differences between the sequences were assessed by using Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon rank sum tests (phantom data) and mixed-effect models (in vivo data).T1 mapping accuracy in phantoms was lower with ShMOLLI (62 msec) and MOLLI (44 msec) than with SASHA (13 msec; P < .05) and SAPPHIRE (12 msec; P < .05). MOLLI had similar precision to ShMOLLI (4.0 msec vs 5.6 msec; P = .07) but higher precision than SAPPHIRE (6.8 msec; P = .002) and SASHA (8.7 msec; P < .001). All sequences had similar reproducibility in phantoms (P = .1). The four sequences had similar in vivo reproducibility for native T1 mapping (\u223c25-50 msec; P > .05) and ECV quantification (\u223c0.01-0.02; P > .05).SASHA and SAPPHIRE yield higher accuracy, lower precision, and similar reproducibility compared with MOLLI and ShMOLLI for T1 measurement. Different sequences yield different ECV values; however, all sequences have similar reproducibility for ECV quantification.",
        "To use baseline computed tomographic (CT) angiography to analyze imaging and clinical end points in an Interventional Management of Stroke III cohort to identify patients who would benefit from endovascular stroke therapy.The primary clinical end point was 90-day dichotomized modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. Secondary end points were 90-day mRS score distribution and 24-hour recanalization. Prespecified subgroup was baseline proximal occlusions (internal carotid, M1, or basilar arteries). Exploratory analyses were subsets with any occlusion and specific sites of occlusion (two-sided \u03b1 = .01).Of 656 subjects, 306 (47%) underwent baseline CT angiography or magnetic resonance angiography. Of 306, 282 (92%) had arterial occlusions. At baseline CT angiography, proximal occlusions (n = 220) demonstrated no difference in primary outcome (41.3% [62 of 150] endovascular vs 38% [27 of 70] intravenous [IV] tissue-plasminogen activator [tPA]; relative risk, 1.07 [99% confidence interval: 0.67, 1.70]; P = .70); however, 24-hour recanalization rate was higher for endovascular treatment (n = 167; 84.3% [97 of 115] endovascular vs 56% [29 of 52] IV tPA; P < .001). Exploratory subgroup analysis for any occlusion at baseline CT angiography did not demonstrate significant differences between endovascular and IV tPA arms for primary outcome (44.7% [85 of 190] vs 38% [35 of 92], P = .29), although ordinal shift analysis of full mRS distribution demonstrated a trend toward more favorable outcome (P = .011). Carotid T- or L-type occlusion (terminal internal carotid artery [ICA] with M1 middle cerebral artery and/or A1 anterior cerebral artery involvement) or tandem (extracranial or intracranial) ICA and M1 occlusion subgroup also showed a trend favoring endovascular treatment over IV tPA alone for primary outcome (26% [12 of 46] vs 4% [one of 23], P = .047).Significant differences were identified between treatment arms for 24-hour recanalization in proximal occlusions; carotid T- or L-type and tandem ICA and M1 occlusions showed greater recanalization and a trend toward better outcome with endovascular treatment. Vascular imaging should be mandated in future endovascular trials to identify such occlusions. Online supplemental material is available for this article."
