        "To observe the longitudinal changes of nerve repair in rats after tissue-engineered construct implantation at magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and to determine whether the enhanced nerve regeneration with use of tissue-engineered constructs could be monitored with gadofluorine M-enhanced MR imaging or nerve T2 relaxation time measurement.All experimental protocols were approved by the institutional Animal Use and Care Committee. Tissue-engineered constructs were prepared by seeding mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into chitosan nerve tubes. Thirty-six rats with sciatic nerve transection injury underwent nerve tube implantation with (n = 18) or without (n = 18) MSC seeding. Sequential T2 measurement, gadofluorine M-enhanced MR imaging, and sciatic function index measurement were performed over an 8-week follow-up period, with histologic assessments performed at regular intervals. T2 relaxation times and signal intensity at gadofluorine M-enhanced T1-weighted imaging were measured and were compared by using repeated-measures analysis of variance followed by the Student-Neuman-Keuls post-hoc test for multiple pairwise comparisons.Nerve T2 relaxation times and gadofluorine M enhancement, as well as functional changes, showed a similar time course. Nerves implanted with MSC-seeded tubes achieved slightly better functional recovery and enhanced nerve regeneration while showing a slower return to baseline T2 relaxation time and a more rapid decline in gadofluorine M enhancement compared with nerves implanted with chitosan tubes alone. T2 values of the distal portion of transected nerves showed a more rapid return to baseline level than did gadofluorine M enhancement.Peripheral nerve repair with use of tissue-engineered constructs can be monitored by using gadofluorine M-enhanced MR imaging and T2 relaxation time measurements. T2 relaxation time seems more sensitive than gadofluorine M-enhanced MR imaging for detecting nerve regeneration.",
        "To determine whether ureteral segments not filled with contrast material at computed tomographic (CT) urography ever contain tumor detectable only by filling these segments with contrast material.In this institutional review board-approved, HIPAA-compliant retrospective study, with waiver of informed consent, databases were searched for all patients who underwent heminephroureterectomy or ureteroscopy between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2009, with available CT urography findings in the 12 months prior to surgery or biopsy and patients who had undergone at least two CT urography procedures with a minimum 5-year follow-up between studies. One of two radiologists blinded to results of pathologic examination recorded location of unfilled segments, time of scan, subsequent filling, and pathologic or 5-year follow-up CT urography results. Tumors were considered missed in an unfilled segment if tumor was found at pathologic examination or follow-up CT urography in the same one-third of the ureter and there were no secondary signs of a mass with other index CT urography sequences. Estimated radiation dose for additional delayed sequences was calculated with a 32-cm phantom.In 59 male and 33 female patients (mean age, 66 years) undergoing heminephroureterectomy, 27 tumors were present in 41 partially nonopacified ureters in 20 patients. Six tumors were present in nonopacified segments (one multifocal, none bilateral); all were identifiable by means of secondary signs present with earlier sequences. Among 182 lesions biopsied at ureteroscopy in 124 male and 53 female patients (mean age, 69 years), 28 tumors were present in nonopacified segments in 25 patients (four multifocal, none bilateral), all with secondary imaging signs detectable without delayed scanning. In 64 male and 29 female patients (mean age, 69 years) who underwent 5-year follow-up CT urography, three new tumors were revealed in three patients; none occurred in the unfilled ureter at index CT urography. Estimated radiation dose from additional sequences was 4.3 mSv per patient.Targeted delayed scanning at CT urography yielded no additional ureteral tumors and resulted in additional radiation exposure.",
        "History An 18-year-old man was diagnosed with precursor B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia and underwent transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells from his human leukocyte antigen-matched sister 1 year prior to admission. He was admitted to evaluate progressive shortness of breath and dry cough of 1-month duration. He did not report fever, night sweats, or hemoptysis. Physical examination revealed he was afebrile and had normal pulse oxygen saturation. The examination revealed crepitation on palpation of the anterior neck, expiratory wheezes, and crackles heard at auscultation of bases of both lungs. Extensive maculopapular rash on the skin was consistent with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Laboratory tests revealed elevated liver transaminase and bilirubin levels that were attributed to liver GVHD. Nonenhanced thin-section CT of the chest was performed (Figs 1-5).",
        "Purpose To examine the effects of subconcussive impacts resulting from a single season of youth (age range, 8\u201313 years) football on changes in specific white matter (WM) tracts as detected with diffusion-tensor imaging in the absence of clinically diagnosed concussions. Materials and Methods Head impact data were recorded by using the Head Impact Telemetry system and quantified as the combined-probability risk-weighted cumulative exposure (RWECP). Twenty-five male participants were evaluated for seasonal fractional anisotropy (FA) changes in specific WM tracts: the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). Fiber tracts were segmented into a central core and two fiber terminals. The relationship between seasonal FA change in the whole fiber, central core, and the fiber terminals with RWECP was also investigated. Linear regression analysis was conducted to determine the association between RWECP and change in fiber tract FA during the season. Results There were statistically significant linear relationships between RWEcp and decreased FA in the whole (R2 = 0.433; P = .003), core (R2 = 0.3649; P = .007), and terminals (R2 = 0.5666; P < .001) of left IFOF. A trend toward statistical significance (P = .08) in right SLF was observed. A statistically significant correlation between decrease in FA of the right SLF terminal and RWECP was also observed (R2 = 0.2893; P = .028). Conclusion This study found a statistically significant relationship between head impact exposure and change of FA fractional anisotropy value of whole, core, and terminals of left IFOF and right SLF's terminals where WM and gray matter intersect, in the absence of a clinically diagnosed concussion. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016",
        "To determine retrospectively the clinical effectiveness of an unenhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging protocol for evaluation of equivocal appendicitis in children.Institutional review board approval was obtained. Pediatric patients (\u226418 years old) underwent unenhanced MR imaging and contrast material-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the appendix between December 2013 and November 2014 and December 2012 and November 2013, respectively, within 24 hours after an abdominal ultrasonographic examination with results equivocal for appendicitis. Pertinent MR imaging and CT reports were reviewed for visibility of the appendix, presence of appendicitis and appendiceal perforation, and establishment of an alternative diagnosis. Surgical reports, pathologic reports, and 30-day follow-up medical records were used as reference standards. Diagnostic performance with MR imaging and CT was calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for diagnosis of appendicitis and appendiceal perforation. The Fisher exact test was used to compare proportions; the Student t test was used to compare means.Diagnostic performance with MR imaging was comparable to that with CT for equivocal pediatric appendicitis. For MR imaging (n = 103), sensitivity was 94.4% (95% CI: 72.7%, 99.9%) and specificity was 100% (95% CI: 95.8%, 100%); for CT [n = 58], sensitivity was 100% (95% CI: 71.5%, 100%), specificity was 97.9% (95% CI: 88.7%, 100%). Diagnostic performance with MR imaging and CT also was comparable for detection of appendiceal perforation, with MR imaging (n = 103) sensitivity of 90.0% (95% CI: 55.5%, 99.8%) and specificity of 85.7% (95% CI: 42.1%, 99.6%) and CT (n = 58) sensitivity of 75.0% (95% CI: 19.4%, 99.4%) and specificity of 85.7% (95% CI: 42.1%, 99.6%). The proportion of examinations with identifiable alternative diagnoses was similar at MR imaging to that at CT (19 of 103 [18.4%] vs eight of 58 [13.8%], respectively; P = .52). The proportion of appendixes seen at MR imaging and at CT also was similar (77 of 103 [74.8%] vs 50 of 58 [86.2%], respectively; P = .11).Unenhanced MR imaging is sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of equivocal appendicitis in nonsedated pediatric patients.",

Physical examination revealed normal muscle bulk, strength, and tone in the bilateral upper and lower extremities but insuppressible left arm and jaw twitching Lumbar puncture revealed no white or red blood cells, a normal glucose level of 55 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) (normal range, 50-80 mg/dL [2.8-4.4 mmol/L]), and an elevated protein level of 81.6 mg/dL (normal range, 15-60 mg/100 dL). A comprehensive metabolic panel revealed lactic acidosis. The patient was initially started on levetiracetam, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and topiramate for status epilepticus. Hepatic dysfunction was not present at initial admission but developed 2 months later, with an alanine aminotransferase level of 90-406 U/L (1.5-6.8 \u03bckat/L) (normal range, 8-37 U/L [0.13-0.62 \u03bckat/L]) and aspartate aminotransferase in the range of 75-187 U/L (1.2-3.1 \u03bckat/L) (normal range, 8-35 U/L [0.13-0.58 \u03bckat/L]). Electroencephalography revealed right parietal and occipital spike-and-wave discharges, with bursts of up to 20 seconds, which were indicative of subclinical status epilepticus. The family history was remarkable for a sister with head lag, developmental delay, seizure disorder, and liver failure.",
        "Purpose To analyze how automatic segmentation translates in accuracy and precision to morphology and relaxometry compared with manual segmentation and increases the speed and accuracy of the work flow that uses quantitative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to study knee degenerative diseases such as osteoarthritis (OA). Materials and Methods This retrospective study involved the analysis of 638 MR imaging volumes from two data cohorts acquired at 3.0 T: (a) spoiled gradient-recalled acquisition in the steady state T1\u03c1-weighted images and (b) three-dimensional (3D) double-echo steady-state (DESS) images. A deep learning model based on the U-Net convolutional network architecture was developed to perform automatic segmentation. Cartilage and meniscus compartments were manually segmented by skilled technicians and radiologists for comparison. Performance of the automatic segmentation was evaluated on Dice coefficient overlap with the manual segmentation, as well as by the automatic segmentations' ability to quantify, in a longitudinally repeatable way, relaxometry and morphology. Results The models produced strong Dice coefficients, particularly for 3D-DESS images, ranging between 0.770 and 0.878 in the cartilage compartments to 0.809 and 0.753 for the lateral meniscus and medial meniscus, respectively. The models averaged 5 seconds to generate the automatic segmentations. Average correlations between manual and automatic quantification of T1\u03c1 and T2 values were 0.8233 and 0.8603, respectively, and 0.9349 and 0.9384 for volume and thickness, respectively. Longitudinal precision of the automatic method was comparable with that of the manual one. Conclusion U-Net demonstrates efficacy and precision in quickly generating accurate segmentations that can be used to extract relaxation times and morphologic characterization and values that can be used in the monitoring and diagnosis of OA. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To compare the performance of a deep-learning bone age assessment model based on hand radiographs with that of expert radiologists and that of existing automated models. Materials and Methods The institutional review board approved the study. A total of 14 036 clinical hand radiographs and corresponding reports were obtained from two children's hospitals to train and validate the model. For the first test set, composed of 200 examinations, the mean of bone age estimates from the clinical report and three additional human reviewers was used as the reference standard. Overall model performance was assessed by comparing the root mean square (RMS) and mean absolute difference (MAD) between the model estimates and the reference standard bone ages. Ninety-five percent limits of agreement were calculated in a pairwise fashion for all reviewers and the model. The RMS of a second test set composed of 913 examinations from the publicly available Digital Hand Atlas was compared with published reports of an existing automated model. Results The mean difference between bone age estimates of the model and of the reviewers was 0 years, with a mean RMS and MAD of 0.63 and 0.50 years, respectively. The estimates of the model, the clinical report, and the three reviewers were within the 95% limits of agreement. RMS for the Digital Hand Atlas data set was 0.73 years, compared with 0.61 years of a previously reported model. Conclusion A deep-learning convolutional neural network model can estimate skeletal maturity with accuracy similar to that of an expert radiologist and to that of existing automated models. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 An earlier incorrect version of this article appeared online.

        "To evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of ultrasonographically (US) guided percutaneous core biopsy of reticular infiltrations alone without mass in the mesentery and omentum at contrast material-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT).This study was approved by the institutional review board, and the need for obtaining signed informed consent was waived for this retrospective analysis. From March 2004 to May 2009, 45 patients (mean age, 52.3 years; age range, 21-89 years) with reticular infiltrations alone without mass in the mesentery and omentum at contrast-enhanced abdominal CT underwent US-guided percutaneous core biopsy. Twenty-one men and 24 women were included. The area with the severest infiltrations at CT was targeted during real-time US-guided percutaneous biopsy. Biopsy results were compared with the final results of surgery or follow-up. The diagnostic accuracy of US-guided percutaneous biopsy was then calculated.One patient had an insufficient biopsy specimen. Among the 44 patients with sufficient biopsy specimens, 17 patients had malignancy, 12 had tuberculosis, and 15 had nonspecific inflammation. All 29 patients with malignancy and tuberculosis at biopsy had that confirmed with surgery or follow-up results. Two of 15 patients with nonspecific inflammation at percutaneous biopsy were confirmed as having malignancy at surgery and four as having tuberculosis after improvement with empirical antituberculosis therapy. The diagnostic accuracy of US-guided percutaneous biopsy of reticular infiltrations in the mesentery and omentum was 84%; the sensitivity and specificity was, respectively, 89% and 100% for malignancy, 75% and 100% for tuberculosis, and 90% and 83% for nonspecific inflammation.US-guided percutaneous core biopsy is a feasible diagnostic method with high specificity for confirmative diagnosis of reticular infiltrations alone in the mesentery and omentum at contrast-enhanced CT.",
        "Introduction: Ocular volume measurement is essential for prompt diagnosis and management of eye diseases such as microphthalmos, buphthalmos, macrophthalmos, orbital tumours and refractive errors such as myopia and hypermetropia.Aims and Objective: To measure ocular volume in a population of Nigerian adults with B-mode ultrasonography and establish the range of normal ocular volumes in the population studied.Materials and Method: Four hundred subjects were scanned in this study using Sonoace X8 Ultrasound Machine (Medison, South Korea). Each subject eyeball volume was measured by B-mode ultrasonography. The ocular volumes were correlated with sex, age, height, and weight and body mass index. The data from the study was analyzed using statistical package for social science software version 17 (SPSS Inc, Chicago).Result: Of the 400 subjects evaluated, 56.3% were female. The mean age of the subjects was 36.67years \u00b1 10.84, while that of the male and female subjects were 36.46years \u00b1 11.32 and 36.93years \u00b1 10.46 respectively. The right ocular volume (ROV) was slightly larger than the left ocular volume (LOV) in both sexes [male: ROV=8.38cm3 \u00b1 0.57, LOV=8.31cm3 \u00b1 0.48; female: ROV=8.31cm3 \u00b1 0.58, LOV=8.21cm3 \u00b1 0.56], although the differences between the ocular volumes were not statistically significant in both genders [p>0.005]. Both eyeball increased in volume till fourth decade of life; right ocular volume increased till thirty-two years of age while left ocular volumes increased till forty-two years of age. Both ocular Volumes thereafter decreased gradually as age increased. The ocular volume correlated positively with the age and height, but negatively with the weight and body mass index in both genders.Conclusion: The ocular volume correlated positively with the age and height; and negatively with the weight and body mass index of the subjects. It was observed that males had slightlylarger eyeballs in comparison to females, and that right eyeball volume was larger than the left eyeball volume. The differences were not statistically significant.",
        "History A 31-year-old woman with a history of bilateral orthotopic lung transplantation performed 10 months earlier for cystic fibrosis presented for a routine follow-up appointment, with her chief symptom being a cough. The cough started approximately 1 month prior to this appointment and was minimally productive of clear to yellow phlegm. In addition to her cough, she reported increased sinus congestion and a sensation of \u201csomething in her upper chest.\u201d She denied shortness of breath, wheezing, hemoptysis, or cigarette smoking. Review of systems was negative for fever, chills, or night sweats. At physical examination, the patient was afebrile, borderline tachycardic (heart rate, 99 beats per minute), and mildly hypertensive (blood pressure, 138/99 mm Hg). Oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. Laboratory evaluation revealed a white blood cell count of 3.5 \u00d7 109/L (normal range, 3.2\u20139.8 \u00d7 109/L). Pulmonary function testing was notable for a newly decreased ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) to forced vital capacity (FVC) of 64% (2.0 and 3.4 L, respectively) (normal FEV1-to-FVC ratio, 80%), suggesting an obstructive lung process. One month prior to presentation, the patient\u2019s sputum cultures grew Pseudomonas and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The patient showed no evidence of active infection at the time of bronchoscopy. Thus, the bacteria were favored to reflect colonization, and antibiotic therapy was not administered at that time. The patient was taking an immunosuppression regimen of mycophenalate mofetil (CellCept; Genentech, San Francisco, Calif) (1 g twice daily), prednisone (10 mg daily), and tacrolimus (Prograf; Astellas Pharma US, Northbrook, Ill) (goal therapeutic range, 12\u201314 ng/mL).

        "To identify predictors of clinically important abnormal findings in computed tomography (CT) images of the head among emergency department (ED) patients without a history of trauma.Approval was obtained from the institutional research ethics board, and informed consent from patients was not required. This study was a retrospective review of consecutive unenhanced head CT examinations in patients aged 18 years or older who did not have trauma or known intracranial pathologic processes in ED from January 2004 through June 2006. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of clinically important abnormal CT findings in the derivation cohort (CT examinations from January 1, 2004, through August 15, 2005), and the reproducibility of findings in a validation cohort (all subsequent CT scans through to June 30, 2006) was assessed. The strength of association of each variable was expressed with clinically important abnormal CT findings as adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).Of 29 469 consecutive head CT images performed at a single institution between January 1, 2004, and June 30, 2006, 3967 were eligible for this study. Of the CT images in these patients, 548 (13.8%) revealed clinically important abnormalities. Six independent clinical predictors of important abnormal findings on head CT were identified: age (adjusted OR per 10-year increase: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.28), focal neurologic deficit (adjusted OR: 5.39; 95% CI: 3.90, 7.47), altered mental status (adjusted OR: 2.32; 95% CI: 1.66, 3.25), history of malignancy (adjusted OR: 4.11; 95% CI: 2.28, 7.42), nausea and/or vomiting (adjusted OR: 2.22; 95% CI: 1.14, 4.33), and derangements in coagulation profile (adjusted OR: 1.91; 95% CI: 1.07, 3.41).This study identified several potential clinical predictors of abnormal head CT findings in ED patients who did not sustain trauma. Prospective validation of a clinical prediction rule in this population is warranted.",
        "Purpose To identify the ability of computer-derived three-dimensional (3D) computed tomographic (CT) segmentation techniques to help differentiate lung adenocarcinoma subtypes. Materials and Methods This study had institutional research board approval and was HIPAA compliant. Pathologically classified resected lung adenocarcinomas (n = 41) with thin-section CT data were identified. Two readers independently placed over-inclusive volumes around nodules from which automated computer measurements were generated: mass (total mass) and volume (total volume) of the nodule and of any solid portion, in addition to the solid percentage of the nodule volume (percentage solid volume) or mass (percentage solid mass). Interobserver agreement and differences in measurements among pathologic entities were evaluated by using t tests. A multinomial logistic regression model was used to differentiate the probability of three diagnoses: invasive non-lepidic-predominant adenocarcinoma (INV), lepidic-predominant adenocarcinoma (LPA), and adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS)/minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA). Results Mean percentage solid volume of INV was 35.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 26.2%, 44.5%)-higher than the 14.5% (95% CI: 10.3%, 18.7%) for LPA (P = .002). Mean percentage solid volume of AIS/MIA was 8.2% (95% CI: 2.7%, 13.7%) and had a trend toward being lower than that for LPA (P = .051). Accuracy of the model based on total volume and percentage solid volume was 73.2%; accuracy of the model based on total mass and percentage solid mass was 75.6%. Conclusion Computer-assisted 3D measurement of nodules at CT had good reproducibility and helped differentiate among subtypes of lung adenocarcinoma. (\u00a9) RSNA, 2016.",
        "BACKGROUND: Head injury is trauma to the head with or without injury to the brain. The incidence is on the increase due to the rapid growth in infrastructure, politics and interpersonal violence. The incidence of head injury is higher among young adults who constitute the most active and productive in any society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAIM AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to determine the computed tomographic findings as well as the correlation between CT findings with the severity of the head injury using GCS.MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a prospective cross sectional study on 231 adult patients who had CT scan of the head following trauma from August 2014 to August 2015. A GE 4 slices Bright speed spiral CT machine was used for the study.RESULTS: Road traffic accident accounted for 90% of the causes of head injury in this study and the most affected age group was 21-30 years with an overall mean age and SD of 38.12 \u00b1 13.58 years. Midline shift of \u2265 5mm showed statistically significant relationship with severity of head injury, P < 0.001.

        "History A 70-year-old woman presented to a peripheral hospital with signs and symptoms of acute chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation. The patient also reported acute on chronic onset of thoracolumbar back pain over a period of 24 hours. She denied any history of recent trauma or intravenous drug use. She did not have any long-term indwelling catheters. The patient's medical history was also complicated by stage 4 renal failure from long-standing type II diabetes, hypertension, iron deficiency anemia, aortic stenosis, and prior bariatric surgery. The patient was not undergoing dialysis for her renal dysfunction, nor was she receiving steroids for COPD. On clinical examination, she was afebrile and tachypneic. Although she was not amenable to a full neurologic examination, she reported subjective leg weakness. There were no localizing signs or evidence of myelopathy. Perianal sensation and rectal tone were preserved. Pulmonary examination revealed wheezes and decreased basilar air entry. The patient's white blood cell count was 6.8 \u00d7 10(9)/L. Her blood chemistry was normal, aside from an elevated blood creatinine level of 158 mmol/L. Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated at 56 mm/h, and her C-reactive protein level was normal at 4.4 mg/L (41.9 nmol/L). Chest radiographs showed mild pulmonary edema with a small right pleural effusion. The patient was transferred to our facility for evaluation of findings on thoracic spine radiographs obtained at a peripheral hospital. Unenhanced thoracic spine magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed first and was followed by computed tomography (CT) to further delineate the findings. The patient's renal status precluded intravenous contrast material administration.",
        "To compare the diagnostic performance of fluorine 18 ((18)F) fluoride positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) with that of conventional imaging (CT and magnetic resonance [MR] imaging) in evaluating the osseous involvement in meningioma.The study was approved by the ethics committee and institutional review board and was conducted according to the Declarations of Helsinki and Tokyo. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. A retrospective comparative study between (18)F-fluoride PET/CT and conventional imaging was conducted to detect osseous involvement in patients with a verified diagnosis of meningioma. Osseous involvement was verified by using definitive surgery (including drilling or careful sampling of the skull in all patients). The diagnostic performance, determined by calculating the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value ( PPV positive predictive value ), negative predictive value ( NPV negative predictive value ), and accuracy, was assessed.Data sets from a total of 78 patients with proven meningioma were compared. Osseous involvement was histopathologically confirmed in 25 patients (32%). The sensitivity, specificity, PPV positive predictive value , NPV negative predictive value , and accuracy were 92.0%, 86.8%, 76.7%, 95.8%, and 88.5% for (18)F-fluoride PET/CT and 64.0%, 83.0%, 64.0%, 83.0%, and 76.9% for conventional imaging, respectively. The receiver operating characteristic ( ROC receiver operating characteristic ) analysis revealed that the area under the ROC receiver operating characteristic curve ( Az area under the ROC curve ) value of (18)F-fluoride PET/CT was significantly greater than that of conventional imaging (0.965 \u00b1 0.02 [standard error] vs 0.703 \u00b1 0.066 [standard error], P < .0001).An approach using (18)F-fluoride PET/CT improves preoperative detection of osseous involvement. In those without abnormal (18)F-fluoride uptake within the skull, the patient may proceed directly to conventional surgery. However, a positive finding of osseous involvement at (18)F-fluoride PET/CT should prompt confirmation by drilling or sampling of bone.",
        "History A 35-year-old man from the upper Midwest region of the United States who had no relevant medical history initially presented to an acute care clinic with multiple small tender skin lesions. His temperature was 38.1\u00b0C, and physical examination revealed several small fluctuant masses that were draining purulent material. Skin culture of one of the draining lesions was performed at this time, but there was no subsequent bacterial growth. A diagnosis of furunculosis was made, and Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim; AR Scientific, Philadelphia, Pa) and a regimen of chlorhexidine washes were prescribed. Two weeks later, the number of skin lesions had increased, and the patient had begun to experience night sweats and fevers. After an episode of hemoptysis and some unusual pain in the patient's right testicle, he presented to the emergency department. At this time, chest radiographs were obtained. The patient was admitted for additional work-up, and computed tomographic (CT) images of the chest were obtained. Physical examination at the time of admission revealed scattered 1-3-cm firm pink hyperpigmented subcutaneous nodules, several of which had overlying pustules. This examination was also notable for a palpable fullness within the right testicle. The patient was afebrile at admission. He denied a history of contact with sick people, illicit drug use, or recent travel. His social history was notable for a 20-pack-year smoking history and a recent relocation to a neighborhood with several new construction sites. Laboratory evaluation revealed leukocytosis (white blood cell count, 15.4 \u00d7 10(9)/L; normal range, [3.5-10.5] \u00d7 10(9)/L), a chemistry panel revealed a low sodium level (132 mEq/L [132 mmol/L]; normal range, 134-142 mEq/L [134-142 mmol/L]), and serum \u03b1-fetoprotein and human chorionic gonadotropin levels were normal. Ultrasonography (US) of the scrotum was performed. Serum analysis was negative for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and type 2 RNA, and Venereal Disease Research Laboratory and rapid plasma regain test results were negative. Blood cultures were negative for bacterial growth. On the basis of chest CT findings, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage was performed. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the abdomen also was performed to further evaluate a focal area of hypoenhancement within the pancreatic tail seen on chest CT images.",
        "History A 37-year-old man from the United States presented with a 1-year history of neck pain and stiffness that had been unsuccessfully treated with manipulative therapy by a chiropractor at another institution. Past medical history was remarkable only for marijuana and air duster abuse. He denied use of any prescription medications. Physical examination was notable for markedly reduced range of motion of the cervical spine. Laboratory work-up revealed an elevated alkaline phosphatase level (302 U/L [5.0 \u03bckat/L]; normal range, 40\u2013100 U/L [0.7\u20131.67 \u03bckat/L]), but all other laboratory findings, including complete blood count, renal function, liver function, vitamin A level, serum protein electrophoresis, and hepatitis C antibodies were within normal limits.

        "This report is to complement the original Fleischner Society recommendations for incidentally detected solid nodules by proposing a set of recommendations specifically aimed at subsolid nodules. The development of a standardized approach to the interpretation and management of subsolid nodules remains critically important given that peripheral adenocarcinomas represent the most common type of lung cancer, with evidence of increasing frequency. Following an initial consideration of appropriate terminology to describe subsolid nodules and a brief review of the new classification system for peripheral lung adenocarcinomas sponsored by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC), American Thoracic Society (ATS), and European Respiratory Society (ERS), six specific recommendations were made, three with regard to solitary subsolid nodules and three with regard to multiple subsolid nodules. Each recommendation is followed first by the rationales underlying the recommendation and then by specific pertinent remarks. Finally, issues for which future research is needed are discussed. The recommendations are the result of careful review of the literature now available regarding subsolid nodules. Given the complexity of these lesions, the current recommendations are more varied than the original Fleischner Society guidelines for solid nodules. It cannot be overemphasized that these guidelines must be interpreted in light of an individual's clinical history. Given the frequency with which subsolid nodules are encountered in daily clinical practice, and notwithstanding continuing controversy on many of these issues, it is anticipated that further refinements and modifications to these recommendations will be forthcoming as information continues to emerge from ongoing research.",
        "Purpose To perform external validation of a computer-assisted registration algorithm for prone and supine computed tomographic (CT) colonography and to compare the results with those of an existing centerline method. Materials and Methods All contributing centers had institutional review board approval; participants provided informed consent. A validation sample of CT colonographic examinations of 51 patients with 68 polyps (6\u201355 mm) was selected from a publicly available, HIPAA compliant, anonymized archive. No patients were excluded because of poor preparation or inadequate distension. Corresponding prone and supine polyp coordinates were recorded, and endoluminal surfaces were registered automatically by using a computer algorithm. Two observers independently scored three-dimensional endoluminal polyp registration success. Results were compared with those obtained by using the normalized distance along the colonic centerline (NDACC) method. Pairwise Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used to compare gross registration error and McNemar tests were used to compare polyp conspicuity. Results Registration was possible in all 51 patients, and 136 paired polyp coordinates were generated (68 polyps) to test the algorithm. Overall mean three-dimensional polyp registration error (mean \u00b1 standard deviation, 19.9 mm \u00b1 20.4) was significantly less than that for the NDACC method (mean, 27.4 mm \u00b1 15.1; P = .001). Accuracy was unaffected by colonic segment (P = .76) or luminal collapse (P = .066). During endoluminal review by two observers (272 matching tasks, 68 polyps, prone to supine and supine to prone coordinates), 223 (82%) polyp matches were visible (120\u00b0 field of view) compared with just 129 (47%) when the NDACC method was used (P < .001). By using multiplanar visualization, 48 (70%) polyps were visible after scrolling \u00b1 15 mm in any multiplanar axis compared with 16 (24%) for NDACC (P < .001). Conclusion Computer-assisted registration is more accurate than the NDACC method for mapping the endoluminal surface and matching the location of polyps in corresponding prone and supine CT colonographic acquisitions. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.13122083/-/DC1",
        "To compare the content, clarity, and clinical usefulness of conventional (ie, free-form) and structured radiology reports of body computed tomographic (CT) scans, as evaluated by referring physicians, attending radiologists, and radiology fellows at a tertiary care cancer center.The institutional review board approved the study as a quality improvement initiative; no written consent was required. Three radiologists, three radiology fellows, three surgeons, and two medical oncologists evaluated 330 randomly selected conventional and structured radiology reports of body CT scans. For nonradiologists, reports were randomly selected from patients with diagnoses relevant to the physician's area of specialization. Each physician read 15 reports in each format and rated both the content and clarity of each report from 1 (very dissatisfied or very confusing) to 10 (very satisfied or very clear). By using a previously published radiology report grading scale, physicians graded each report's effectiveness in advancing the patient's position on the clinical spectrum. Mixed-effects models were used to test differences between report types.Mean content satisfaction ratings were 7.61 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.12, 8.16) for conventional reports and 8.33 (95% CI: 7.82, 8.86) for structured reports, and the difference was significant (P < .0001). Mean clarity satisfaction ratings were 7.45 (95% CI: 6.89, 8.02) for conventional reports and 8.25 (95% CI: 7.68, 8.82) for structured reports, and the difference was significant (P < .0001). Grade ratings did not differ significantly between conventional and structured reports.Referring clinicians and radiologists found that structured reports had better content and greater clarity than conventional reports.",
        "HistoryA 64-year-old woman with a medical history notable for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cigarette smoking, type II diabetes mellitus, and end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis presented to the emergency department with tender swelling of her neck, which began 2 days prior to presentation.Four days prior to presentation, her dialysis catheter (Palindrome; Medtronic, Mannsfield, Mass) was partially pulled during dialysis. The next day, she underwent successful percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty with an iodinated contrast medium (20 mL Iopamiro; Bracco, Milano, Italy) via the existing right subclavian vein dialysis catheter because of stenosis in the superior vena cava. In addition, exchange of the dialysis catheter via guidewire was performed, without any reported complications. The following day, the patient underwent an uneventful scheduled hemodialysis treatment via the newly exchanged catheter.The patient denied trauma prior to the swelling. She had no known allergies, and prior exposure to iodinated contrast media on two occasions (2 months and 5 years before this presentation) was uneventful.Upon examination, the patient was fully alert and calm without any signs of distress and had bilateral submandibular firm nonpulsatile tender masses, each estimated at 3-4 cm in diameter.Because of a recent major vascular intervention, CT angiography of the neck was urgently performed.",
        "To compare retrospectively the effects of percutaneous radiofrequency (RF) ablation with those of hepatic resection in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) measuring 2 cm or smaller.This study was approved by the institutional ethics committee, and all patients provided written informed consent before treatment. From December 2003 to December 2008, 145 patients with a resectable HCC measuring 2 cm or smaller were studied. Sixty-six patients had a central HCC (located at least 3 cm from the liver capsule). As an initial treatment, 71 patients were treated with percutaneous RF ablation and 74 with surgical resection. Of the patients with central HCC, 37 underwent percutaneous RF ablation and 29 underwent surgical resection. Survival curves were constructed with the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by using the log-rank test. The relative prognostic significance of the variables for predicting overall survival rates was assessed with multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Complications were observed clinically when patients were admitted and assessed by telephone interview after patients were discharged.One death was considered to be related to treatment after surgical resection. Major complications occurred significantly more often in the surgical resection group (38 of 74 patients) than in the RF ablation group (14 of 71 patients) (P = .009).

        "Background Assessment of lumbar spinal stenosis at MRI is repetitive and time consuming. Deep learning (DL) could improve \u00adproductivity and the consistency of reporting. Purpose To develop a DL model for automated detection and classification of lumbar central canal, lateral recess, and neural \u00adforaminal stenosis. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, lumbar spine MRI scans obtained from September 2015 to September 2018 were included. Studies of patients with spinal instrumentation or studies with suboptimal image quality, as well as postgadolinium studies and studies of patients with scoliosis, were excluded. Axial T2-weighted and sagittal T1-weighted images were used. Studies were split into an internal training set (80%), validation set (9%), and test set (11%). Training data were labeled by four radiologists using predefined gradings (normal, mild, moderate, and severe). A two-component DL model was developed. First, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained to detect the region of interest (ROI), with a second CNN for classification. An internal test set was labeled by a musculoskeletal radiologist with 31 years of experience (reference standard) and two subspecialist radiologists (radiologist 1: A.M., 5 years of experience; radiologist 2: J.T.P.D.H., 9 years of experience). DL model performance on an external test set was evaluated. Detection recall (in percentage), interrater agreement (Gwet \u03ba), sensitivity, and specificity were calculated. Results Overall, 446 MRI lumbar spine studies were analyzed (446 patients; mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 52 years \u00b1 19; 240 women), with 396 patients in the training (80%) and validation (9%) sets and 50 (11%) in the internal test set. For internal testing, DL model and radiologist central canal recall were greater than 99%, with reduced neural foramina recall for the DL model (84.5%) and radiologist 1 (83.9%) compared with radiologist 2 (97.1%) (P < .001). For internal testing, dichotomous classification (normal or mild vs moderate or severe) showed almost-perfect agreement for both radiologists and the DL model, with respective \u03ba values of 0.98, 0.98, and 0.96 for the central canal; 0.92, 0.95, and 0.92 for lateral recesses; and 0.94, 0.95, and 0.89 for neural foramina (P < .001). External testing with 100 MRI scans of lumbar spines showed almost perfect agreement for the DL model for dichotomous classification of all ROIs (\u03ba, 0.95\u20130.96; P < .001). Conclusion A deep learning model showed comparable agreement with subspecialist radiologists for detection and classification of central canal and lateral recess stenosis, with slightly lower agreement for neural foraminal stenosis at lumbar spine MRI. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "To use large-scale network (LSN) analysis to classify subjects with Alzheimer disease (AD), those with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and cognitively normal (CN) subjects.The study was conducted with institutional review board approval and was in compliance with HIPAA regulations. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was used to acquire the voxelwise time series in 55 subjects with clinically diagnosed AD (n = 20), aMCI (n =15), and normal cognitive function (n = 20). The brains were divided into 116 regions of interest (ROIs). The Pearson product moment correlation coefficients of pairwise ROIs were used to classify these subjects. Error estimation of the classifications was performed with the leave-one-out cross-validation method. Linear regression analysis was performed to analyze the relationship between changes in network connectivity strengths and behavioral scores.The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) yielded 87% classification power, 85% sensitivity, and 80% specificity between the AD group and the non-AD group (subjects with aMCI and CN subjects) in the first-step classification. For differentiation between subjects with aMCI and CN subjects, AUC was 95%; sensitivity, 93%; and specificity, 90%. The decreased network indexes were significantly correlated with the Mini-Mental State Examination score in all tested subjects. Similarly, changes in network indexes significantly correlated with Rey Auditory Verbal Leaning Test delayed recall scores in subjects with aMCI and CN subjects.LSN analysis revealed that interconnectivity patterns of brain regions can be used to classify subjects with AD, those with aMCI, and CN subjects. In addition, the altered connectivity networks were significantly correlated with the results of cognitive tests.",
        "To determine the prevalence of demonstrable stent-graft degradation by using three-dimensional computed tomographic (CT) angiography to assess endoleak and stent-graft migration after endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR).The institutional review board approved this retrospective study. Sixty-two consecutive patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm treated with the AneuRx stent-graft (Medtronic, Santa Rosa, Calif) were assessed between 0.5 and 9.5 years after EVAR (median, 5.1 years) for the presence of broken attachment sutures and metal-ring fractures by using CT angiography. The relative risk (RR) of delayed endoleak formation and endograft migration was calculated relative to the presence of suture breaks and metal-ring fractures. A two-tailed Fisher exact test was used to assess significant differences.Suture breaks were observed in 55 of 62 subjects (89%), including 37 minor breaks (60%) and 18 major breaks (29%). Metal-ring fractures were observed in 11 of 62 subjects (18%). Twenty-seven endoleaks were observed in 24 of 62 subjects (39%) and were categorized as type I in seven of 27 (11%), type II in 16 of 27 (26%), and type III in four of 27 (6%). Major suture breaks were associated with six of seven (86%) delayed type I endoleaks (RR = 19.4, P = .003), and metal-ring fractures were associated with four of seven (57%) delayed type I endoleaks (RR = 6.2, P = .015) and three of four (75%) type III endoleaks (RR = 13.9, P = 003). Migration was observed in 15 of 62 patients (24%) and was associated with major suture breaks in 10 of 15 patients (67%, RR = 4.5, P = .001) and with metal-ring fractures in five of 11 patients (45%, RR = 4.1, P = .003). Repeat interventions were performed in 15 patients.Major suture breaks and metal-ring fractures are demonstrated with CT and are associated with delayed type I and III endoleaks and with stent-graft migration after EVAR.",
        "To demonstrate the feasibility of using chemical shift magnetic resonance (MR) imaging fat-water separation methods for quantitative estimation of transcatheter lipiodol delivery to liver tissues.Studies were performed in accordance with institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. Proton nuclear MR spectroscopy was first performed to identify lipiodol spectral peaks and relative amplitudes. Next, phantoms were constructed with increasing lipiodol-water volume fractions. A multiecho chemical shift-based fat-water separation method was used to quantify lipiodol concentration within each phantom. Six rats served as controls; 18 rats underwent catheterization with digital subtraction angiography guidance for intraportal infusion of a 15%, 30%, or 50% by volume lipiodol-saline mixture. MR imaging measurements were used to quantify lipiodol delivery to each rat liver. Lipiodol concentration maps were reconstructed by using both single-peak and multipeak chemical shift models. Intraclass and Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated for statistical comparison of MR imaging-based lipiodol concentration and volume measurements to reference standards (known lipiodol phantom compositions and the infused lipiodol dose during rat studies).Both single-peak and multipeak measurements were well correlated to phantom lipiodol concentrations (r(2) > 0.99). Lipiodol volume measurements were progressively and significantly higher when comparing between animals receiving different doses (P < .05 for each comparison). MR imaging-based lipiodol volume measurements strongly correlated with infused dose (intraclass correlation coefficients > 0.93, P < .001) with both single- and multipeak approaches.Chemical shift MR imaging fat-water separation methods can be used for quantitative measurements of lipiodol delivery to liver tissues.",
        "Purpose To evaluate the performance of a prototype photon-counting detector (PCD) computed tomography (CT) system for abdominal CT in humans and to compare the results with a conventional energy-integrating detector (EID). Materials and Methods The study was HIPAA-compliant and institutional review board\u2013approved with informed consent. Fifteen asymptomatic volunteers (seven men; mean age, 58.2 years \u00b1 9.8 [standard deviation]) were prospectively enrolled between September 2 and November 13, 2015. Radiation dose\u2013matched delayed contrast agent\u2013enhanced spiral and axial abdominal EID and PCD scans were acquired. Spiral images were scored for image quality (Wilcoxon signed-rank test) in five regions of interest by three radiologists blinded to the detector system, and the axial scans were used to assess Hounsfield unit accuracy in seven regions of interest (paired t test). Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to assess reproducibility. PCD images were also used to calculate iodine concentration maps. Spatial resolution, noise-power spectrum, and Hounsfield unit accuracy of the systems were estimated by using a CT phantom. Results In both systems, scores were similar for image quality (median score, 4; P = .19), noise (median score, 3; P = .30), and artifact (median score, 1; P = .17), with good interrater agreement (image quality, noise, and artifact ICC: 0.84, 0.88, and 0.74, respectively). Hounsfield unit values, spatial resolution, and noise-power spectrum were also similar with the exception of mean Hounsfield unit value in the spinal canal, which was lower in the PCD than the EID images because of beam hardening (20 HU vs 36.5 HU; P < .001). Contrast-to-noise ratio of enhanced kidney tissue was improved with PCD iodine mapping compared with EID (5.2 \u00b1 1.3 vs 4.0 \u00b1 1.3; P < .001). Conclusion The performance of PCD showed no statistically significant difference compared with EID when the abdomen was evaluated in a conventional scan mode. PCD provides spectral information, which may be used for material decomposition. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016",
        "To evaluate ultrasonographic (US) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings, histopathologic etiologies, and outcomes for developing asymmetry at mammography.In this institutional review board-approved, informed consent-waived, HIPAA-compliant, retrospective review of a mammography database for records from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2012, 2354 consecutive diagnostic mammograms classified as showing focal asymmetry were identified. After patients with benign results, those considered stable, and those without prior mammograms were excluded, images from 521 studies were reviewed and 202 developing lesions were identified in 201 women. Patient demographics, US and MR imaging findings, and clinical and histopathologic outcomes were obtained from the electronic medical records. Equivocal US correlates of findings with developing asymmetry detected at mammography were excluded from statistical analysis. The Fisher exact test and Student t test analysis were performed and relative risk and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined.Biopsy was performed in 73 (36%) of 201 patients with developing asymmetries, with 42 (58%) benign and 31 (42%) malignant results. Of 128 patients with nonbiopsied lesions, 110 (86%) were stable at 24 months (considered benign), 12 (9.4%) were stable at less than 24 months, and six (4.7%) were lost to follow-up. Diagnostic US was performed in 186 (93%) of 201 patients, 74 (40%) with correlates. US was performed in 30 (97%) of 31 patients with malignant developing asymmetries, 17 (57%) with correlates, and in 140 (92%) of 152 patients with benign lesions, 51 (36%) with correlates (risk ratio, 1.92; 95% CI: 1.001, 3.695; two-tailed P = .064, one-tailed P = .038). MR imaging was performed in 66 (33%) of 201 patients, 26 (39%) with correlates. MR imaging was performed in 10 (32%) of 31 patients with malignant developing asymmetries, all with correlates, and 53 (35%) of 152 patients with benign lesions, 15 (28%) with correlates (P < .0001).Developing asymmetries were malignant in 15% (95% CI: 11%, 21.1%) of patients.

        "To compare the performance of two versions of reconstructed two-dimensional (2D) images in combination with digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) versus the performance of standard full-field digital mammography (FFDM) plus DBT.This trial had ethical committee approval, and all participants gave written informed consent. Examinations (n = 24 901) in women between the ages of 50 and 69 years (mean age, 59.2 years) were interpreted prospectively as part of a screening trial that included independent interpretations of FFDM plus DBT and reconstructed 2D images plus DBT. Reconstructed 2D images do not require radiation exposure. Using analyses for binary data that accounted for correlated interpretations and were adjusted for reader-specific volume, two versions (initial and current) of reconstructed 2D images used during trial periods 1 (from November 22, 2010, to December 21, 2011; 12 631 women) and 2 (from January 20, 2012, to December 19, 2012; 12 270 women) were compared in terms of cancer detection and false-positive rates with the corresponding FFDM plus DBT interpretations.Cancer detection rates were 8.0, 7.4, 7.8, and 7.7 per 1000 screening examinations for FFDM plus DBT in period 1, initial reconstructed 2D images plus DBT in period 1, FFDM plus DBT in period 2, and current reconstructed 2D images plus DBT in period 2, respectively. False-positive scores were 5.3%, 4.6%, 4.6%, and 4.5%, respectively. Corresponding reader-adjusted paired comparisons of false-positive scores revealed significant differences for period 1 (P = .012) but not for period 2 (ratio = 0.99; 95% confidence interval: 0.88, 1.11; P = .85).The combination of current reconstructed 2D images and DBT performed comparably to FFDM plus DBT and is adequate for routine clinical use when interpreting screening mammograms.",
        "Background A categorical CT assessment scheme for suspicion of pulmonary involvement of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19 provides a basis for gathering scientific evidence and improved communication with referring physicians. Purpose To introduce the COVID-19 Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS) for use in the standardized assessment of pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 on unenhanced chest CT images and to report its initial interobserver agreement and performance. Materials and Methods The Dutch Radiological Society developed CO-RADS based on other efforts for standardization, such as the Lung Imaging Reporting and Data System or Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System. CO-RADS assesses the suspicion for pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 on a scale from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high). The system is meant to be used in patients with moderate to severe symptoms of COVID-19. The system was evaluated by using 105 chest CT scans of patients admitted to the hospital with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 and in whom reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed (mean, 62 years \u00b1 16 [standard deviation]; 61 men, 53 with positive RT-PCR results). Eight observers used CO-RADS to assess the scans. Fleiss \u03ba value was calculated, and scores of individual observers were compared with the median of the remaining seven observers. The resulting area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) was compared with results from RT-PCR and clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Results There was absolute agreement among observers in 573 (68.2%) of 840 observations. Fleiss \u03ba value was 0.47 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.45, 0.47), with the highest \u03ba value for CO-RADS categories 1 (0.58, 95% CI: 0.54, 0.62) and 5 (0.68, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.72). The average AUC was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.97) for predicting RT-PCR outcome and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.91, 0.99) for clinical diagnosis. The false-negative rate for CO-RADS 1 was nine of 161 cases (5.6%; 95% CI: 1.0%, 10%), and the false-positive rate for CO-RADS category 5 was one of 286 (0.3%; 95% CI: 0%, 1.0%). Conclusion The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS) is a categorical assessment scheme for pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 at unenhanced chest CT that performs very well in predicting COVID-19 in patients with moderate to severe symptoms and has substantial interobserver agreement, especially for categories 1 and 5. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020",
        "History A 54-year-old white woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis who was taking glucocorticoids and methotrexate presented to the emergency department in December with worsening shortness of breath and chest heaviness for 1 week. She reported additional symptoms of weakness, headache, and arthralgia primarily involving her bilateral hands, wrist, ankles, and feet. She denied experiencing fevers, syncope or presyncope, focal neurologic deficits, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, unintentional weight loss, or recent trauma. Additional medical history included hypertension, asthma, degenerative disk disease, and migraine, all of which were reportedly controlled with medications. This patient had a smoking history of 80 pack-years, but she had quit smoking 2 months prior to presentation. She denied abuse of alcohol or recreational drugs and reported she was up-to-date on her immunizations, including those for pneumonia and flu. Family history was pertinent for breast cancer in her mother, sister, and maternal aunt. The patient reported normal findings at screening mammography and colonoscopy. A physical examination was remarkable for slightly asymmetric breath sounds, which appeared to be diminished on the right side. This patient had multiple joint deformities, most notably in the bilateral metacarpophalangeal joints. Initial electrocardiography findings and cardiac biomarkers were negative. Her complete blood count and basic metabolic profile were unremarkable. Posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs were obtained in the emergency department. Subsequently, computed tomography (CT) of the chest was performed.",
        "Purpose To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance (MR) elastography as a method to help diagnose clinically substantial fibrosis in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and, by using MR elastography as a reference standard, to compare various laboratory marker panels in the identification of patients with NAFLD and advanced fibrosis. Materials and Methods This retrospective study was institutional review board approved and HIPAA complaint. Informed consent was waived. This study was conducted in patients with NAFLD, who were identified by imaging characteristics consistent with steatosis in a prospective database that tracks all MR elastographic examinations. Six laboratory-based models of fibrosis were compared with MR elastographic results as well as fibrosis stage from liver biopsy results. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of each data set were compared. Results Among 325 patients with NAFLD with MR elastographic data, there were 142 patients who underwent liver biopsy within 1 year of MR elastography. When comparing MR elastography results with liver biopsy results, the best cutoff for advanced fibrosis (stage F3\u2013F4, 46 [32.4%] of 142) was 4.15 kPa (AUROC = 0.954, sensitivity = 0.85, specificity = 0.929). This cutoff value identified 104 patients with advanced fibrosis (32.0% of 325 patients). The FIB-4 score (AUROC = 0.827) and NAFLD fibrosis score (AUROC = 0.821) had the best diagnostic accuracy for advanced fibrosis, with high negative predictive values (NAFLD fibrosis score = 0.90 and FIB-4 score = 0.899). Conclusion MR elastography is a useful diagnostic tool for detecting advanced fibrosis in NAFLD. Of the laboratory-based methods, the NAFLD fibrosis and FIB-4 scores can most reliably detect advanced fibrosis. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.13121193/-/DC1",
        "Purpose To assess the position and signal intensity of the ulnar nerve at elbow extension and flexion by using magnetic resonance imaging. Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval and written informed consent were obtained. Transverse T2-weighted images were obtained perpendicular to the upper arm in 100 healthy elbows of 50 volunteers (23 men, 27 women; age range, 21-57 years) and nine elbows with ulnar neuropathy (five men, four women; age range, 24-59 years) with extension and 130\u00b0 of flexion. Ulnar nerve position was classified into three types: no dislocation, subluxation, or dislocation. One-way analysis of variance, paired t tests, Student t tests, and multiple regression analysis were used to analyze correlations between ulnar nerve movement angle during flexion and age, sex, presence of the anconeus epitrochlearis muscle, and ulnar neuropathy and to compare the contrast-to-noise ratio of nerve to muscle between extension and flexion. Results Nerve positions in healthy elbows were as follows: All had no dislocation at extension, and at flexion, 51 of 100 elbows (51.0%) had no dislocation, 30 of 100 elbows (30.0%) had subluxation, and 19 of 100 elbows (19.0%) had dislocation. Nerve movement angle was smaller in elbows with the anconeus epitrochlearis muscle than in those without the muscle (P = .045, .015). Presence of the muscle was the only significant factor associated with nerve movement angle (P = .047, .013). Only dominant elbows with nerve movement angle of less than 15\u00b0 and nondominant elbows with nerve movement angle of less than 10\u00b0 showed contrast-to-noise ratio increase at flexion (P = .021-.030). Conclusion Ulnar nerve movement during flexion was apparent in approximately half of healthy elbows and was similar between healthy elbows and elbows with ulnar neuropathy. Nerve signal intensity increased during flexion only in elbows without apparent nerve movement. (\u00a9) RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Background Obesity has been associated with increased risk of accelerated cognitive decline and dementia, which suggests underlying neurobiological changes. Purpose To investigate the associations between obesity and brain structure (overall and regional brain volumes, and white matter microstructure) assessed at MRI in a sample of the general population. Materials and Methods Between March 2014 and January 2018, 12 087 participants (52.8% women [6381 of 12 087]; mean age, 62 years; age range, 45\u201376 years) in the prospective observational UK Biobank study underwent 3.0-T multiparametric (ie, three-dimensional T1-weighted diffusion tensor imaging [DTI]) brain imaging. Percentage of total body fat (TBF) was assessed by body impedance. Volumetric measures included brain volume, gray matter volume, white matter volume, volumes of subcortical gray matter structures, and regional cortical volumes. Global and tract-specific microstructure was assessed by fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) by using DTI. Linear regression was performed by using TBF as determinant and brain measures as outcome variables, and effect estimates were expressed as standardized \u03b2 values. Results Mean body mass index was 26.6 kg/m2 \u00b1 4.4 (standard deviation [SD]), mean TBF in men was 24.4% \u00b1 5.5, and mean TBF in women was 35.5% \u00b1 6.5. In men, TBF was negatively associated with all subcortical gray matter volumes (thalamus, caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens) other than amygdala volume. In women, TBF was solely negatively associated with globus pallidus volume. In women and men, TBF was positively associated with global FA (women vs men, 0.05 vs 0.07 SD change in global FA per SD change in TBF; P < .001). TBF was negatively associated with global MD in women (\u22120.07 SD change in global MD per SD change in TBF; P < .001). Conclusion These findings provide evidence that obesity is associated with smaller subcortical gray matter volumes. In addition, obesity was associated with higher coherence but lower magnitude of white matter microstructure, which suggests differential influences of obesity on the geometric organization of white matter microstructure. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "INTRODUCTION: Atherosclerosis implicated in the pathophysiology of stroke is widely assessed by ultrasound evaluation of intima media thickness, plaques and stenosis in the carotid vessels.AIM AND OBJECTIVES: The main aim of this study is to determine the intima media thickness (IMT) in the common carotid arteries, carotid bulb and internal carotid arteries10(CCA, CB and ICA respectively) in stroke patients. The relationship between carotid intima-media thickness with stroke types/ subtypes, and cardiovascular risk factors, sonographic characteristics of carotid plaques with stroke types/ subtypes, and presence of ICA stenosis in stroke is also to be determined.MATERIALS AND METHOD: Using a high frequency linear probe with frequency range between 7.5MHZ to 12 MHZ, 100 adult subjects (50 stroke patients and 50 healthy controls) had their common carotid arteries, carotid bulb and internal carotid arteries on both sides evaluated for their intima- media thickness and presence of plaques on B mode and velocities on colour Doppler interrogation. In addition, detailed clinical histories were taken and laboratory examinations done to measure traditional risk factors in the study subjects. Data was analysed using SPSS version 18.RESULTS: IMT was higher in stroke patients compared to controls in the 3 carotid segments (all p < 0.05). The mean IMT (average of both sides) were 1.36 0.29mm, 1.37 0.51mm and 1.20 0.26mm in the stroke cases and 0.72 0.09mm, 0.70 0.09mm and 0.69 0.09mm in the healthy controls in the CCA, CB and ICA respectfully. IMT was also higher with the presence of plaques in both cases and controls, and in ischemic stroke compared to the haemorrhagic stroke particularly in the non-lacunar and lacunar subtypes. IMT among the stroke cases did not differ in the presence of risk factors except for age. IMT in the 3 carotid segments significantly increased with increasing age in both cases and controls on both sides (all p < 0.05). Stroke cases also had significantly more plaques than the controls except in the contralateral bulb and both ICA. Plaques with irregular surfaces and ulcerations were associated with non-lacunar stroke in theipsilateral CCA and hypoechoic plaques with non-lacunar stroke in the ipsilateral bulb. ICA stenosis occurred in 4 (8%) of the stroke cases in this study.CONCLUSION: IMT is increased with increasing age and in stroke subjects compared to healthy controls. Carotid IMTs, number and sonographic characteristics of plaques with velocity measurements are helpful in typing and subtyping of stroke. ICA stenosis occurred in only 8% of the stroke cases in this study.",
        "To describe nationwide trends and factors associated with the use of computed tomography (CT) in children visiting emergency departments (EDs) in the United States between 1995 and 2008.This study was exempt from institutional review board oversight. Data from the 1995-2008 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey were used to evaluate the number and percentage of visits associated with CT for patients younger than 18 years. A mean of 7375 visits were sampled each year. Data were subcategorized according to multiple patient and hospital characteristics. The Rao-Scott \u03c7(2) test was performed to determine whether CT use was similar across subpopulations.From 1995 to 2008, the number of pediatric ED visits that included CT examination increased from 0.33 to 1.65 million, a fivefold increase, with a compound annual growth rate of 13.2%. The percentage of visits associated with CT increased from 1.2% to 5.9%, a 4.8-fold increase, with a compound annual growth rate of 12.8%. The number of visits associated with CT at pediatric-focused and non-pediatric-focused EDs increased from 14,895 and 316,133, respectively, in 1995 to 212,716 and 1,438,413, respectively, in 2008. By the end of the study period, top chief complaints among those undergoing CT included head injury, abdominal pain, and headache.Use of CT in children who visit the ED has increased substantially and occurs primarily at non-pediatric-focused facilities. This underscores the need for special attention to this vulnerable population to ensure that imaging is appropriately ordered, performed, and interpreted.",
        "Intracranial vessel wall magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has gained much attention in the past decade and has become part of state-of-the-art MR imaging protocols to assist in diagnosing the cause of ischemic stroke. With intracranial vessel wall imaging, vessel wall characteristics have tentatively been described for atherosclerosis, vasculitis, dissections, Moyamoya disease, and aneurysms. With the increasing demand and subsequently increased use of intracranial vessel wall imaging in clinical practice, radiologists should be aware of the choices in imaging parameters and how they affect image quality, the clinical indications, methods of assessment, and limitations in the interpretation of these images. In this How I do It article, the authors will discuss the technical requirements and considerations for vessel wall image acquisition in general, describe their own vessel wall imaging protocol at 3 T and 7 T, show a step-by-step basic assessment of intracranial vessel wall imaging as performed at their institution\u2013including commonly encountered artifacts and pitfalls\u2013and summarize the commonly reported imaging characteristics of various intracranial vessel wall diseases for direct clinical applicability. Finally, future technical and clinical considerations for full implementation of intracranial vessel wall imaging in clinical practice, including the need for histologic validation and acquisition time reduction, will be discussed.",
        "Purpose To determine if the obliteration of a cervical space, the paraspinal fat pad (PFP), can be used as an indicator at computed tomography (CT) of an injury of cervical spine posterior ligamentous complex (PLC). Materials and Methods This retrospective study was approved by the institutional board review; written informed consent was obtained from healthy subjects and was waived for patients. First, PFP appearance was evaluated in an anatomic specimen and in 10 healthy subjects on spine CT scans by three radiologists (readers 1, 2, and 3) working in consensus. Then, in 85 patients with suspicion of cervical spine trauma following high-velocity trauma, readers 2 and 3 reviewed in consensus the cervical spine CT (reference for fracture and luxation) and 1.5-T magnetic resonance images (T1, T2, and short inversion time inversion-recovery sequences; reference for ligament and disk injuries and contusion or occult fracture) for traumatic injuries. CT appearance of PFP was independently analyzed by readers 1 and 2, and interobserver agreement (weighted kappa) was calculated. Relationships between PFP changes and injuries and descriptive analysis were calculated by using logistic regression and Fisher test, respectively. Results The PFP could be identified as a well-circumscribed fatty area between cervical spine and posterior muscles. Interobserver agreement was 0.76. An abnormal PFP was associated with PLC (P < .001) and arch (P = .006) injuries but not with body (P = .056), longitudinal ligaments (P = .412), or disk (P = .665) injuries. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for PLC injuries were 55% (11 of 20), 97% (38 of 39), 92% (11 of 12), and 81% (38 of 47), respectively. Conclusion PFP changes on CT scans are significantly associated with injuries of PLC in patients with spine cervical trauma. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "History A 47-year-old man presented with palpitations and decreased exercise tolerance. A peripheral blood smear revealed anemia, thrombocytopenia, and blast cells, and a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia was made. Immunohistochemistry revealed positivity for cluster of differentiation (or CD) markers, which have been reported to be associated with an increased risk of extramedullary leukemic involvement. Thus, contrast material-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis was requested to enable exclusion of any extramedullary extension of leukemia. Unenhanced and contrast-enhanced nephrographic phase CT was performed. Follow-up CT 3 months later showed minimal interval change in the lesion (images not shown).",
        "Background Smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have smaller left ventricles (LVs) due to reduced preload. Skeletal muscle wasting is also common in COPD, but less is known about its contribution to LV size. Purpose To explore the relationships between CT metrics of emphysema, venous vascular volume, and sarcopenia with the LV epicardial volume (LVEV) (myocardium and chamber) estimated from chest CT images in participants with COPD and then to determine the clinical relevance of the LVEV in multivariable models, including sex and anthropomorphic metrics. Materials and Methods The COPDGene study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00608764) is an ongoing prospective longitudinal observational investigation that began in 2006. LVEV, distal pulmonary venous blood volume for vessels smaller than 5 mm2 in cross section (BV5), CT emphysema, and pectoralis muscle area were retrospectively extracted from 3318 nongated, unenhanced COPDGene CT scans. Multivariable linear and Cox regression models were used to explore the association between emphysema, venous BV5, pectoralis muscle area, and LVEV as well as the association of LVEV with health status using the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire, 6-minute walk distance, and all-cause mortality. Results The median age of the cohort was 64 years (interquartile range, 57-70 years). Of the 2423 participants, 1806 were men and 617 were African American. The median LVEV between Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 1 and GOLD 4 COPD was reduced by 13.9% in women and 17.7% in men (P < .001 for both). In fully adjusted models, higher emphysema percentage (\u03b2 = -4.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -5.0, -3.4; P < .001), venous BV5 (\u03b2 = 7.0; 95% CI: 5.7, 8.2; P < .001), and pectoralis muscle area (\u03b2 = 2.7; 95% CI: 1.2, 4.1; P < .001) were independently associated with reduced LVEV. Reductions in LVEV were associated with improved health status (\u03b2 = 0.3; 95% CI: 0.1, 0.4) and 6-minute walk distance (\u03b2 = -12.2; 95% CI: -15.2, -9.3). These effects were greater in women than in men. The effect of reduced LVEV on mortality (hazard ratio: 1.07; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.09) did not vary by sex. Conclusion In women more than men with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a reduction in the estimated left ventricle epicardial volume correlated with a loss of pulmonary venous vasculature, greater pectoralis muscle sarcopenia, and lower all-cause mortality. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To report long-term outcomes of radiation segmentectomy (RS) for early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The authors hypothesized that outcomes are comparable to curative treatments for patients with solitary HCC less than or equal to 5 cm and preserved liver function. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included 70 patients (median age, 71 years; range, 22\u201396 years) with solitary HCC less than or equal to 5 cm not amenable to percutaneous ablation who underwent RS (dose of >190 Gy) between 2003 and 2016. Patients who underwent subsequent curative liver transplantation were excluded to eliminate this confounding variable affecting survival. Radiologic response of time to progression and median overall survival were estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier method per the guidelines of the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and the World Health Organization (WHO). Results Seventy patients were treated with RS over 14 years. Sixty-three patients (90%) showed response by using EASL criteria, of which 41 (59%) showed complete response. Fifty patients (71%) achieved response by using WHO criteria, of which 11 (16%) achieved complete response. Response rates at 6 months were 86% and 49% by using EASL and WHO criteria, respectively. Median time to progression was 2.4 years (95% confidence interval: 2.1, 5.7), with 72% of patients having no target lesion progression at 5 years. Median overall survival was 6.7 years (95% confidence interval: 3.1, 6.7); survival probability at 1, 3, and 5 years was 98%, 66%, and 57%, respectively. Overall survival probability at 1, 3, and 5 years was 100%, 82%, and 75%, respectively, in patients with baseline tumor size less than or equal to 3 cm (n = 45) and was significantly longer than in patients with tumors greater than 3 cm (P = .026). Conclusion RS provides response rates, tumor control, and survival outcomes comparable to curative-intent treatments for selected patients with early-stage HCC who have preserved liver function. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To determine whether C-reactive protein is associated with the type of coronary plaque seen at computed tomographic (CT) angiography.The institutional review board approved this retrospective study, and the need for informed consent was waived. C-reactive protein levels were measured in 2653 asymptomatic subjects (mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 54.7 years \u00b1 9.2; 1811 men) who underwent self-referred coronary CT angiography as part of a general health checkup. The presence of coronary plaque, plaque type (calcified, mixed calcified, or noncalcified), stenosis degree, and number of involved segments were evaluated. Subjects with one type of plaque (calcified plaque, mixed plaque, and noncalcified plaque groups) and two or more types of plaque (multiple lesions group) were analyzed separately. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between increasing C-reactive protein levels and plaque type.Coronary plaque was found in 1150 of the 2653 subjects (43.3%): calcified plaque (n = 604, 22.8%), mixed plaque (n = 67, 2.5%), noncalcified plaque (n = 208, 7.8%), and multiple lesions (n = 271, 10.2%). The C-reactive protein cutoff value of the fourth quartile was 1.2 mg/L (11.4 nmol/L), and all types of coronary plaque were increased in the higher quartile of the C-reactive protein levels. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that a higher C-reactive protein level was an independent predictor for the presence of noncalcified plaque (fourth vs first quartile group, odds ratio = 1.70, P = .025) and significant (50% and higher) coronary stenosis (odds ratio = 1.76, P = .020) after adjustment for traditional risk factors for coronary artery disease.C-reactive protein is associated with noncalcified coronary arterial plaque, as seen at coronary CT angiography in asymptomatic patients after adjustment for traditional risk factors.",
        "To evaluate the effectiveness of a staged ultrasonography (US) and computed tomography (CT) imaging protocol for the accurate diagnosis of suspected appendicitis in children and the opportunity for reducing the number of CT examinations and associated radiation exposure.This retrospective study was compliant with HIPAA, and a waiver of informed consent was approved by the institutional review board. This study is a review of all imaging studies obtained in children suspected of having appendicitis between 2003 and 2008 at a suburban pediatric emergency department. A multidisciplinary staged US and CT imaging protocol for the diagnosis of appendicitis was implemented in 2003. In the staged protocol, US was performed first in patients suspected of having appendicitis; follow-up CT was recommended when US findings were equivocal. Of 1228 pediatric patients who presented to the emergency department for suspected appendicitis, 631 (287 boys, 344 girls; age range, 2 months to 18 years; median age, 10 years) were compliant with the imaging pathway. The sensitivity, specificity, negative appendectomy rate (number of appendectomies with normal pathologic findings divided by the number of surgeries performed for suspected appendicitis), missed appendicitis rate, and number of CT examinations avoided by using the staged protocol were analyzed.The sensitivity and specificity of the staged protocol were 98.6% and 90.6%, respectively. The negative appendectomy rate was 8.1% (19 of 235 patients), and the missed appendicitis rate was less than 0.5% (one of 631 patients). CT was avoided in 333 of the 631 patients (53%) in whom the protocol was followed and in whom the US findings were definitive.A staged US and CT imaging protocol in which US is performed first in children suspected of having acute appendicitis is highly accurate and offers the opportunity to substantially reduce radiation.",
        "Purpose To evaluate whether dual-selectin\u2013targeted US molecular imaging allows longitudinal monitoring of anti-inflammatory treatment effects in an acute terminal ileitis model in swine. Materials and Methods The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all animal studies. Fourteen swine with chemically induced acute terminal ileitis (day 0) were randomized into the following groups: (a) an anti-inflammatory treatment group (n = 8; meloxicam, 0.25 mg per kilogram of body weight; prednisone, 0.5 mg/kg) and (b) a control group (n = 6; saline). US molecular imaging was performed with a clinical US machine after intravenous injection of clinically translatable dual P- and E-selectin\u2013targeted microbubbles (5 \u00d7 108/kg). Three inflamed bowel segments per swine were imaged at baseline, as well as on days 1, 3, and 6 after treatment initiation. At day 6, bowel segments were analyzed ex vivo for selectin expression levels by using quantitative immunofluorescence. Results After induction of inflammation, US molecular imaging signal increased at day 1 in both animal groups (P < .001). At day 3, signal in the treatment group decreased (P < .001 vs day 1), while signal in control animals did not significantly change (P = .18 vs day 1) and was higher (P = .001) compared with that in the treatment group. At day 6, signal in the treatment group further decreased and remained lower (P = .02) compared with that in the control group. Immunofluorescence confirmed significant (P \u2264 .04) downregulation of both P- and E-selectin expression levels in treated versus control bowel segments. Conclusion Dual-selectin\u2013targeted US molecular imaging allows longitudinal monitoring of anti-inflammatory treatment effects in a large-animal model of acute ileitis. This supports further clinical development of this quantitative and radiation-free technique for monitoring inflammatory bowel disease. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",

        "An 11-year-old girl presented to the pediatric gastroenterology outpatient department of our institution with gradually increasing painless abdominal distention. The distention started 2 years earlier and was not associated with any other constitutional symptoms, vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice, hematemesis, or melaena. She reported early satiety and heaviness in the lower abdomen. The abdominal swelling was predominantly in the infraumbilical region and was soft at palpation. She was the first child of nonconsanguineous parents and had an uneventful perinatal course after a normal vaginal delivery. Her developmental milestones were normal. She had an average scholastic performance at school. There was no history of visual problems, seizures, or inappropriate behaviors. She had an early menarche 2 years previously. Her menstrual cycles were regular, and there was no abnormal vaginal discharge. Her breast development was normal (Tanner stage III), while pubic and axillary hair were absent (Tanner stage I). She was short for her age (104 cm; normal range, 120-154 cm). There was no history of short stature among her siblings or parents. Laboratory investigations were performed to measure thyroid-stimulating hormone (1354.34 \u03bcIU/mL; normal range, 0.35-5.5 \u03bcIU/mL), triiodothyronine (<2.5 ng/dL [0.0385 pmol/L]; normal range, 100-200 ng/dL [1.54-3.08 pmol/L]), thyroxine (1.35 \u03bcg/dL [17.37 nmol/L]; normal range, 5-12 \u03bcg/dL [64.35-154.44 nmol/L]), \u03b2-human chorionic gonadotropin (<1.2 mIU/mL; normal, <5 mIU/mL), luteinizing hormone (0.08 mIU/mL; normal range, 0.1-6.0 mIU/mL), and follicle-stimulating hormone (6.93 mIU/mL; normal range, 0.3-2.0 mIU/mL) levels. Complete blood count was normal. An abdominal mass was suspected, and abdominopelvic CT was performed and followed by US; these examinations revealed multiple large cysts in both ovaries (Figs 1, 2A, 2B). The uterus was pubertal in shape, and endometrial thickness was 9 mm, representing normal follicular phase measurement. Serum CA-125 and inhibin levels were normal. To evaluate short stature, radiographs of the hand (Fig 3) and pelvis (Fig 3B) were obtained as part of a limited skeletal survey, keeping in mind the possible skeletal changes associated with hypothyroidism. In view of the hypothyroidism, US of neck was also performed (Fig 4). Treatment was started based on the clinical and radiologic parameters, and the child's condition improved with medical treatment.",
        "Background Brain MRI parenchymal signal abnormalities have been associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Purpose To describe the neuroimaging findings (excluding ischemic infarcts) in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Materials and Methods This was a retrospective study of patients evaluated from March 23, 2020, to April 27, 2020, at 16 hospitals. Inclusion criteria were (a) positive nasopharyngeal or lower respiratory tract reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays, (b) severe COVID-19 infection defined as a requirement for hospitalization and oxygen therapy, (c) neurologic manifestations, and (d) abnormal brain MRI findings. Exclusion criteria were patients with missing or noncontributory data regarding brain MRI or brain MRI showing ischemic infarcts, cerebral venous thrombosis, or chronic lesions unrelated to the current event. Categorical data were compared using the Fisher exact test. Quantitative data were compared using the Student t test or Wilcoxon test. P < .05 represented a significant difference. Results Thirty men (81%) and seven women (19%) met the inclusion criteria, with a mean age of 61 years \u00b1 12 (standard deviation) (age range, 8-78 years). The most common neurologic manifestations were alteration of consciousness (27 of 37, 73%), abnormal wakefulness when sedation was stopped (15 of 37, 41%), confusion (12 of 37, 32%), and agitation (seven of 37, 19%). The most frequent MRI findings were signal abnormalities located in the medial temporal lobe in 16 of 37 patients (43%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 27%, 59%), nonconfluent multifocal white matter hyperintense lesions seen with fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion-weighted sequences with variable enhancement, with associated hemorrhagic lesions in 11 of 37 patients (30%; 95% CI: 15%, 45%), and extensive and isolated white matter microhemorrhages in nine of 37 patients (24%; 95% CI: 10%, 38%). A majority of patients (20 of 37, 54%) had intracerebral hemorrhagic lesions with a more severe clinical presentation and a higher admission rate in intensive care units (20 of 20 patients [100%] vs 12 of 17 patients without hemorrhage [71%], P = .01) and development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (20 of 20 patients [100%] vs 11 of 17 patients [65%], P = .005).

        "To retrospectively compare transition zone (TZ) cancer detection and localization accuracy of 3-T T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with that of multiparametric (MP) MR imaging, with radical prostatectomy specimens as the reference standard.The informed consent requirement was waived by the institutional review board. Inclusion criteria were radical prostatectomy specimen TZ cancer larger than 0.5 cm(3) and 3-T endorectal presurgery MP MR imaging (T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted [DW] imaging apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC] maps [b < 1000 sec/mm(2)], and dynamic contrast material-enhanced [DCE] MR imaging). From 197 patients with radical prostatectomy specimens, 28 patients with TZ cancer were included. Thirty-five patients without TZ cancer were randomly selected as a control group. Four radiologists randomly scored T2-weighted and DW ADC images, T2-weighted and DCE MR images, and T2-weighted, DW ADC, and DCE MR images. TZ cancer suspicion was rated on a five-point scale in six TZ regions of interest (ROIs). A score of 4-5 was considered a positive finding. A score of 4 or higher for any ROI containing TZ cancer was considered a positive detection result at the patient level. Generalized estimating equations were used to analyze detection and localization accuracy by using ROI-receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analyses for the latter. Gleason grade (GG) 4-5 and GG 2-3 cancers were analyzed separately.Detection accuracy did not differ between T2-weighted and MP MR imaging for all TZ cancers (68% vs 66%, P = .85), GG 4-5 TZ cancers (79% vs 72%-75%, P = .13), and GG 2-3 TZ cancers (66% vs 62%-65%, P = .47). MP MR imaging (area under the ROC curve, 0.70-0.77) did not improve T2-weighted imaging localization accuracy (AUC = 0.72) (P > .05).Use of 3-T MP MR imaging, consisting of T2-weighted imaging, DW imaging ADC maps (b values, 50, 500, and 800 sec/mm(2)), and DCE MR imaging may not improve TZ cancer detection and localization accuracy compared with T2-weighted imaging.http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.12120281/-/DC1.",
        "Purpose To determine the individual and combined performance of magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopic imaging and diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging at 3 T in the in vivo assessment of prostate cancer aggressiveness by using histopathologically defined regions of interest on radical prostatectomy specimens to define the prostate cancer regions to be investigated. Materials and Methods The local institutional ethics review board approved this retrospective study and waived the informed consent requirement. Fifty-four patients with biopsy-proved prostate cancer underwent clinical MR spectroscopic imaging followed by prostatectomy. Guided by the histopathologic map, all spectroscopy voxels that contained tumor tissue were selected, and metabolite ratios (choline [Cho] plus creatine [Cr]-to-citrate [Cit] and Cho/Cr ratios) were derived. For each spectroscopic voxel, 25th percentile apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the region corresponding to that voxel was determined, representing the most aberrant tumor part on the ADC map, which was often smaller than spectroscopic imaging voxels. Maximum metabolic ratios and minimum 25th percentile ADC of each tumor were related to tumor aggressiveness and were used to differentiate aggressiveness classes. A logistic regression model (LRM) was used to combine data from both modalities. Results Significant correlation was found between aggressiveness classes and maximum Cho+Cr/Cit ratio (\u03c1 = 0.36), maximum Cho/Cr ratio (\u03c1 = 0.35), and minimum 25th percentile ADC (\u03c1 = \u22120.63) in the peripheral zone (PZ). In the transition zone (TZ), the correlation was significant for only Cho+Cr/Cit and Cho/Cr ratios (\u03c1 = 0.58 and \u03c1 = 0.60, respectively). For differentiation between aggressiveness classes, LRM use did not result in significantly improved differentiation over any individual variables. Conclusion These findings enabled confirmation that MR spectroscopic imaging and DW imaging offer potential for in vivo noninvasive assessment of prostate cancer aggressiveness, and both modalities have comparable performance. The combination did not result in better performance. Nonetheless, the better performances of metabolite ratios in the TZ and of ADCs in the PZ suggest that they have complementary value. \u00a9 RSNA, 2012",
        "Background Although deep learning has brought revolutionary changes in health care, reliance on manually selected cross-sectional images and segmentation remain methodological barriers. Purpose To develop and validate an automated preoperative artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm for tumor and lymph node (LN) segmentation with CT imaging for prediction of LN metastasis in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, patients with surgically resected, pathologically confirmed PDAC underwent multidetector CT from January 2015 to April 2020. Three models were developed, including an AI model, a clinical model, and a radiomics model. CT-determined LN metastasis was diagnosed by radiologists. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to develop the clinical and radiomics models. The performance of the models was determined on the basis of their discrimination and clinical utility. Kaplan-Meier curves, the log-rank test, or Cox regression were used for survival analysis. Results Overall, 734 patients (mean age, 62 years \u00b1 9 [SD]; 453 men) were evaluated. All patients were split into training (n = 545) and validation (n = 189) sets. Patients who had LN metastasis (LN-positive group) accounted for 340 of 734 (46%) patients. In the training set, the AI model showed the highest performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.91) in the prediction of LN metastasis, whereas the radiologists and the clinical and radiomics models had AUCs of 0.58, 0.76, and 0.71, respectively. In the validation set, the AI model showed the highest performance (AUC, 0.92) in the prediction of LN metastasis, whereas the radiologists and the clinical and radiomics models had AUCs of 0.65, 0.77, and 0.68, respectively (P < .001). AI model-predicted positive LN metastasis was associated with worse survival (hazard ratio, 1.46; 95% CI: 1.13, 1.89; P = .004). Conclusion An artificial intelligence model outperformed radiologists and clinical and radiomics models for prediction of lymph node metastasis at CT in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. \u00a9 RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "With more than 900 000 confirmed cases worldwide and nearly 50 000 deaths during the first 3 months of 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has emerged as an unprecedented health care crisis. The spread of COVID-19 has been heterogeneous, resulting in some regions having sporadic transmission and relatively few hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and others having community transmission that has led to overwhelming numbers of severe cases. For these regions, health care delivery has been disrupted and compromised by critical resource constraints in diagnostic testing, hospital beds, ventilators, and health care workers who have fallen ill to the virus exacerbated by shortages of personal protective equipment. Although mild cases mimic common upper respiratory viral infections, respiratory dysfunction becomes the principal source of morbidity and mortality as the disease advances. Thoracic imaging with chest radiography and CT are key tools for pulmonary disease diagnosis and management, but their role in the management of COVID-19 has not been considered within the multivariable context of the severity of respiratory disease, pretest probability, risk factors for disease progression, and critical resource constraints. To address this deficit, a multidisciplinary panel comprised principally of radiologists and pulmonologists from 10 countries with experience managing patients with COVID-19 across a spectrum of health care environments evaluated the utility of imaging within three scenarios representing varying risk factors, community conditions, and resource constraints. Fourteen key questions, corresponding to 11 decision points within the three scenarios and three additional clinical situations, were rated by the panel based on the anticipated value of the information that thoracic imaging would be expected to provide. The results were aggregated, resulting in five main and three additional recommendations intended to guide medical practitioners in the use of chest radiography and CT in the management of COVID-19.",
        "Purpose To describe carpet lesions (laterally spreading tumors \u2265 3 cm) detected at computed tomographic (CT) colonography, including their clinical, imaging, and pathologic features. Materials and Methods The imaging reports for 9152 consecutive adults undergoing initial CT colonography at a tertiary center were reviewed in this HIPAA-compliant, institutional review board\u2013approved retrospective study to identify all potential carpet lesions detected at CT colonography. Carpet lesions were defined as morphologically flat, laterally spreading tumors 3 cm or larger. For those patients with neoplastic carpet lesions, CT colonography studies were analyzed to determine maximal lesion width and height, oral contrast material coating, segmental location, and computer-aided detection (CAD) findings. Demographic data and details of clinical treatment in these patients were reviewed. Results Eighteen carpet lesions in 18 patients (0.2%; mean age, 67.1 years; eight men, 10 women) were identified and were subsequently confirmed at colonoscopy and pathologic examination among 20 potential flat masses (\u22653 cm) prospectively identified at CT colonography (there were two nonneoplastic rectal false-positive findings). No additional neoplastic carpet lesions were found in the cohort undergoing colonoscopy after CT colonography and/or surgery (there were no false-negatives). Mean lesion width was 46.5 mm (range, 30\u201380 mm); mean lesion height was 7.9 mm (range, 4\u201314 mm). Surface retention of oral contrast material was noted in all 18 cases. All but two lesions were located in the distal rectosigmoid or proximal right colon. At CAD, 17 (94.4%) lesions were detected (mean, 6.2 CAD marks per lesion). Sixteen lesions (88.9%) demonstrated advanced histologic features, including a villous component (n = 11), high-grade dysplasia (n = 4), and invasive cancer (n = 5). Sixteen patients (88.9%) required surgical treatment for complete excision. Conclusion CT colonography can effectively depict carpet lesions. Common features in this series included older patient age, rectal or cecal location, surface coating with oral contrast material, multiple CAD hits, advanced yet typically benign histologic features, and surgical treatment. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To investigate whether low graft attenuation at unenhanced computed tomography (CT) is associated with 1-month mortality or graft failure after liver transplant and determine its diagnostic performance. Materials and Methods Included were 663 recipients who underwent CT imaging within 7 days after liver transplant between December 2014 and August 2016. Initial poor function (IPF) was diagnosed by using a combination of laboratory values within 7 days after liver transplant and subdivided patients into primary and secondary IPF. At 1 month after the operation, mortality and graft failure or survival in recipients was categorized. Two radiologists who were blinded to clinical data retrospectively and independently evaluated graft attenuation on unenhanced CT images (high or isoattenuation, graft attenuation greater than or equal to that of spleen; low, graft attenuation less than that of spleen). The interobserver agreement was evaluated by using intraclass correlation coefficient and \u03ba statics. Incidence of low graft attenuation between recipients with IPF and those with normal function was compared by using \u03c72 test. The relationship between graft attenuation and outcome in primary and secondary IPF was evaluated by using log-rank test. Results Of 663 recipients, 114 had IPF (80 primary; 34 secondary). After 1 month, 11 had graft failure or died, whereas 652 survived. Low graft attenuation was more common in patients with IPF than in normal-function patients (P < .001). In the primary group (those without identifiable cause), 15 patients had low graft attenuation, which led to mortality or graft failure within 1 month in seven of those patients. No recipient with high or isoattenuation had 1-month mortality or graft failure (P < .001). The secondary group (those with identifiable cause) showed no significant association between graft attenuation and 1-month mortality and graft failure (P = .181). Values of low graft attenuation for 1-month mortality and graft failure in primary IPF were positive predictive value, 46.7%; negative predictive value, 100%; sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 89.0%; and accuracy, 90.0%. There was excellent interobserver agreement in the assessment of graft attenuation (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.957; \u03ba = 1.00). Conclusion Low graft attenuation can be associated with 1-month mortality or graft failure in liver graft recipients with primary IPF. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017.",
        "Purpose To determine the minimum dose of technetium 99m (99mTc) mercaptoacetyltriglycerine (MAG3) needed to perform dynamic renal scintigraphy in the pediatric population without loss of diagnostic quality or accurate quantification of renal function and to investigate whether adaptive noise reduction could help further reduce the minimum dose required. Materials and Methods Approval for this retrospective study was obtained from the institutional review board, with waiver of informed consent. A retrospective review was conducted in 33 pediatric patients consecutively referred for a 99mTc-MAG3 study. In each patient, a 20-minute dynamic study was performed after administration of 7.4 MBq/kg. Binomial subsampling was used to simulate studies performed with 50%, 30%, 20%, and 10% of the administered dose. Four nuclear medicine physicians independently reviewed the original and subsampled images, with and without noise reduction, for image quality. Two observers independently performed a quantitative analysis of renal function. Subjective rater confidence was analyzed by using a logistic regression model, and the quantitative analysis was performed by using the paired Student t test. Results Reducing the administered dose to 30% did not substantially affect image quality, with or without noise reduction. When the dose was reduced to 20%, there was a slight but significant decrease (P = .0074) in image quality, which resolved with noise reduction. Reducing the dose to 10% caused a decrease in image quality (P = .0003) that was not corrected with noise reduction. However, the dose could be reduced to 10% without a substantial change in the quantitative evaluation of renal function independent of the application of noise reduction. Conclusion Decreasing the dose of 99mTc-MAG3 from 7.4 to 2.2 MBq/kg did not compromise image quality. With noise reduction, the dose can be reduced to 1.5 MBq/kg without subjective loss in image quality. The quantitative evaluation of renal function was not substantially altered, even with a theoretical dose as low as 0.74 MBq/kg. \u00a9 RSNA, 2011",
        "Purpose To assess the ability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to enable high-performance automated binary classification of chest radiographs. Materials and Methods In a retrospective study, 216 431 frontal chest radiographs obtained between 1998 and 2012 were procured, along with associated text reports and a prospective label from the attending radiologist. This data set was used to train CNNs to classify chest radiographs as normal or abnormal before evaluation on a held-out set of 533 images hand-labeled by expert radiologists. The effects of development set size, training set size, initialization strategy, and network architecture on end performance were assessed by using standard binary classification metrics; detailed error analysis, including visualization of CNN activations, was also performed. Results Average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.96 for a CNN trained with 200 000 images. This AUC value was greater than that observed when the same model was trained with 2000 images (AUC = 0.84, P < .005) but was not significantly different from that observed when the model was trained with 20 000 images (AUC = 0.95, P > .05). Averaging the CNN output score with the binary prospective label yielded the best-performing classifier, with an AUC of 0.98 (P < .005). Analysis of specific radiographs revealed that the model was heavily influenced by clinically relevant spatial regions but did not reliably generalize beyond thoracic disease. Conclusion CNNs trained with a modestly sized collection of prospectively labeled chest radiographs achieved high diagnostic performance in the classification of chest radiographs as normal or abnormal; this function may be useful for automated prioritization of abnormal chest radiographs. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Purpose To determine the rate at which computed tomographically guided pelvic percutaneous bone biopsy in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) yields adequate tissue for genomic profiling and to identify issues likely to affect diagnostic yields. Materials and Methods This study was institutional review board approved, and written informed consent was obtained. In a phase II trial assessing response to everolimus, 31 men with mCRPC underwent 54 biopsy procedures (eight men before and 23 men both before and during treatment). Variables assessed were lesion location (iliac wing adjacent to sacroiliac joint, iliac wing anterior and/or superior to sacroiliac joint, sacrum, and remainder of pelvis), mean lesion attenuation, subjective lesion attenuation (purely sclerotic vs mixed), central versus peripheral lesion sampling, lesion size, core number, and use of zoledronic acid for more than 1 year. Results Of 54 biopsy procedures, 21 (39%) yielded adequate tissue for RNA isolation and genomic profiling. Three of four sacral biopsies were adequate. Biopsies of the ilium adjacent to the sacroiliac joints were more likely adequate than those from elsewhere in the ilium (48% vs 28%, respectively). All five biopsies performed in other pelvic locations yielded inadequate tissue for RNA isolation. Mean attenuation of lesions with inadequate tissue was 172 HU greater than those with adequate tissue (621.1 HU \u00b1 166 vs 449 HU \u00b1 221, respectively; P = .002). Use of zoledronic acid, peripheral sampling, core number, and lesion size affected yields, but the differences were not statistically significant. Histologic examination with hematoxylin-eosin staining showed that results of 36 (67%) biopsies were positive for cancer; only mean attenuation differences were significant (707 HU \u00b1 144 vs 473 HU \u00b1 191, negative vs positive, respectively; P < .001). Conclusion In men with mCRPC, percutaneous sampling of osseous metastases for genomic profiling is possible, but use of zoledronic acid for more than 1 year may reduce the yield of adequate tissue for RNA isolation. Sampling large low-attenuating lesions at their periphery maximizes yield. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "The Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound convened a panel of specialists from radiology, hepatology, pathology, and basic science and physics to arrive at a consensus regarding the use of elastography in the assessment of liver fibrosis in chronic liver disease. The panel met in Denver, Colo, on October 21-22, 2014, and drafted this consensus statement. The recommendations in this statement are based on analysis of current literature and common practice strategies and are thought to represent a reasonable approach to the noninvasive assessment of diffuse liver fibrosis.",
        "Purpose To evaluate the hybrid approach in a large population of patients with melanoma in the head and neck, on the trunk, or on an extremity who were scheduled for sentinel node (SN) biopsy. Materials and Methods This prospective study was approved by the institutional review board. Between March 2010 and March 2013, 104 patients with a melanoma, including 48 women (average age, 54.3 years; range, 18.5\u201387.4 years) and 56 men (average age, 55.2 years; range, 22.4\u201377.4 years) (P = .76) were enrolled after obtaining written informed consent. Following intradermal hybrid tracer administration, lymphoscintigraphy and single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography were performed. Blue dye was intradermally injected prior to the start of the surgical operation (excluding patients with a facial melanoma). Intraoperatively, SNs were initially pursued by using gamma tracing followed by fluorescence imaging (FI) and, when applicable, blue-dye detection. A portable gamma camera was used to confirm SN removal. Collected data included number and location of the preoperatively and intraoperatively identified SNs and the intraoperative number of SNs that were radioactive, fluorescent, and blue. A two-sample test for equality of proportions was performed to evaluate differences in intraoperative SN visualization through FI and blue-dye detection. Results Preoperative imaging revealed 2.4 SNs (range, 1\u20136) per patient. Intraoperatively, 93.8% (286 of 305) of the SNs were radioactive, 96.7% (295 of 305) of the SNs were fluorescent, while only 61.7% (116 of 188) of the SNs stained blue (P < .0001). FI was of value for identification of near-injection-site SNs (two patients), SNs located in complex anatomic areas (head and neck [28 patients]), and SNs that failed to accumulate blue dye (19 patients). Conclusion The hybrid tracer enables both preoperative SN mapping and intraoperative SN identification in melanoma patients. In the setup of this study, optical identification of the SNs through the fluorescent signature of the hybrid tracer was superior compared with blue dye\u2013based SN visualization. \u00a9 RSNA, 2014 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To assess the degree of cortical vein opacification in patients with internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke and to evaluate the relationship with treatment benefit from intra-arterial therapy (IAT). Materials and Methods Written informed consent was obtained from all patients in the Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands. From the trial's database, all patients (recruited from December 2010 until March 2014) with baseline computed tomographic (CT) angiograms were retrospectively included. Enhancement of the vein of Labb\u00e9, sphenoparietal sinus, and superficial middle cerebral vein was graded by one neuroradiologist, as follows: 0, not visible; 1, moderate opacification; and 2, full opacification. The sum for the ipsilateral hemisphere was calculated, resulting in the cortical vein opacification score (COVES) (range, 0\u20136). Primary outcome was the modified Rankin Scale score at 90 days. Association with treatment according to full cortical vein score and different dichotomized cutoff points was estimated with ordinal logistic regression. Interobserver agreement was assessed by two separate observers who reviewed 100 studies each. Results In total, 397 patients were analyzed. Interaction of the cortical vein score with treatment was significant (P = .044) when dichotomized COVES was 0 versus more than 0. The adjusted odds ratio for shift toward better functional outcome was 1.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.5, 2.0) for a COVES of 0 (n = 123) and 2.2 (95% CI: 1.6, 4.1) for a COVES greater than 0 (n = 274). The multirater \u03ba value was 0.73. Conclusion In this study, patients with acute middle cerebral artery stroke with absence of cortical vein opacification in the affected hemisphere (COVES = 0) appeared to have no benefit from IAT, whereas patients with venous opacification (COVES >0) were shown to benefit from IAT. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Clinical trial registration nos.

        "Purpose To characterize the incidence, location, grade, and patterns of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings in the tibia in asymptomatic recruits before and after 4-month basic training and to investigate whether MR imaging parameters correlated with pretraining activity levels or with future symptomatic injury. Materials and Methods This study was approved by three institutional review boards and was conducted in compliance with HIPAA requirements. Volunteers were included in the study after they signed informed consent forms. MR imaging of the tibia of 55 men entering the Israeli Special Forces was performed on recruitment day and after basic training. Ten recruits who did not perform vigorous self-training prior to and during service served as control subjects. MR imaging studies in all recruits were evaluated for presence, type, length, and location of bone stress changes in the tibia. Anthropometric measurements and activity history data were collected. Relationships between bone stress changes, physical activity, and clinical findings and between lesion size and progression were analyzed. Results Bone stress changes were seen in 35 of 55 recruits (in 26 recruits at time 0 and in nine recruits after basic training). Most bone stress changes consisted of endosteal marrow edema. Approximately 50% of bone stress changes occurred between the middle and distal thirds of the tibia. Lesion size at time 0 had significant correlation with progression. All endosteal findings smaller than 100 mm resolved or did not change, while most findings larger than 100 mm progressed. Of 10 control subjects, one had bone stress changes at time 0, and one had bone stress changes at 4 months. Conclusion Most tibial bone stress changes occurred before basic training, were usually endosteal, occurred between the middle and distal thirds of the tibia, were smaller than 100 mm, and did not progress. These findings are presumed to represent normal bone remodeling. \u00a9 RSNA, 2014",
        "Introduction: The measurement of knee joint space width (JSW), between the distal femur and the proximal tibia is an indirect way of measuring the tibio-femoral cartilage thickness, which is considered a valuable parameter, in assessing knee cartilage disease. This study is aimed at establishing normal references of JSW for use in diagnosis and follow up of knee cartilage diseases.\r\nMaterials and Methods: This prospective study was conducted on 300 fixed-flexion erect knee computed radiographs of one hundred and sixty adults. The JSW of both medial and lateral compartments of each knee was measured using in-built electronic calipers.Results: The mean right medial and lateral JSW measured 4.74 mm +0.75 and 5.63 mm +0.86 respectively. The mean left medial and lateral JSW measured 4.74 mm + 0.76 and 5.66 mm + 0.87. No statistically significant difference was found between right and left knee JSW compartments.\r\nConclusion: The radiographic reference values for the knee JSW was obtained, showing no significant gender variation in knee JSW. However, there is decrease in JSW with increasing age.",
        "To determine the causal association and effect of intravenous iodinated contrast material exposure on the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI), also known as contrast material-induced nephropathy (CIN).This retrospective study was approved by an institutional review board and was HIPAA compliant. Informed consent was waived. All contrast material-enhanced (contrast group) and unenhanced (noncontrast group) abdominal, pelvic, and thoracic CT scans from 2000 to 2010 were identified at a single facility. Scan recipients were sorted into low- (<1.5 mg/dL), medium- (1.5-2.0 mg/dL), and high-risk (>2.0 mg/dL) subgroups of presumed risk for CIN by using baseline serum creatinine (SCr) level. The incidence of AKI (SCr \u2265 0.5 mg/dL above baseline) was compared between contrast and noncontrast groups after propensity score adjustment by stratification, 1:1 matching, inverse weighting, and weighting by the odds methods to reduce intergroup selection bias. Counterfactual analysis was used to evaluate the causal relation between contrast material exposure and AKI by evaluating patients who underwent contrast-enhanced and unenhanced CT scans during the study period with the McNemar test.A total of 157,140 scans among 53,439 unique patients associated with 1,510,001 SCr values were identified. AKI risk was not significantly different between contrast and noncontrast groups in any risk subgroup after propensity score adjustment by using reported risk factors of CIN (low risk: odds ratio [OR], 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.76, 1.13; P = .47; medium risk: odds ratio, 0.97; 95% CI: 0.81, 1.16; P = .76; high risk: OR, 0.91; 95% CI: 0.66, 1.24; P = .58). Counterfactual analysis revealed no significant difference in AKI incidence between enhanced and unenhanced CT scans in the same patient (McNemar test: \u03c7(2) = 0.63, P = .43) (OR = 0.92; 95% CI: 0.75, 1.13; P = .46).Following adjustment for presumed risk factors, the incidence of CIN was not significantly different from contrast material-independent AKI. These two phenomena were clinically indistinguishable with established SCr-defined criteria, suggesting that intravenous iodinated contrast media may not be the causative agent in diminished renal function after contrast material administration.http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.12121823/-/DC1.",
        "History A 28-year-old man presented with lifelong anejaculation, which had become an issue because of family planning. The patient had a history of normal erections and experienced the sensation of orgasm without ever ejaculating. On physical examination, both testes were present in the scrotum, with normal dimensions and a normal epididymis bilaterally. The patient had a slightly tender left testicle, and digital rectal examination findings were normal. The patient underwent further investigation for the possibility of retrograde ejaculation with urine cytology, the results of which were negative. Genetic testing was performed to exclude Y chromosome microdeletions. Serum-luteinizing and follicle-stimulating hormone levels were normal, with a borderline low level of testosterone (7.6 nmol/L; normal range, 8.0-29.0 nmol/L). All other pertinent laboratory results were noncontributory. Pelvic MRI was requested to exclude an anatomic cause of anejaculation. MRI was performed in accordance with the standard clinical prostate protocol, with a dynamic contrast material-enhanced study ( Figs 1 - 3 ). CT of the upper abdomen was also performed ( Fig 4 ).

        "Background Previously, the risk of death from breast cancer was analyzed for women participating versus those not participating in the last screening examination before breast cancer diagnosis. Consecutive attendance patterns may further refine estimates. Purpose To estimate the effect of participation in successive mammographic screening examinations on breast cancer mortality. Materials and Methods Participation data for Swedish women eligible for screening mammography in nine counties from 1992 to 2016 were linked with data from registries and regional cancer centers for breast cancer diagnosis, cause, and date of death (Uppsala University ethics committee registration number: 2017/147). Incidence-based breast cancer mortality was calculated by whether the women had participated in the most recent screening examination prior to diagnosis only (intermittent participants), the penultimate screening examination only (lapsed participants), both examinations (serial participants), or neither examination (serial nonparticipants). Rates were analyzed with Poisson regression. We also analyzed incidence of breast cancers proving fatal within 10 years. Results Data were available for a total average population of 549 091 women (average age, 58.9 years \u00b1 6.7 [standard deviation]). The numbers of participants in the four groups were as follows: serial participants, 392 135; intermittent participants, 41 746; lapsed participants, 30 945; and serial nonparticipants, 84 265. Serial participants had a 49% lower risk of breast cancer mortality (relative risk [RR], 0.51; 95% CI: 0.48, 0.55; P < .001) and a 50% lower risk of death from breast cancer within 10 years of diagnosis (RR, 0.50; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.55; P < .001) than serial nonparticipants. Lapsed and intermittent participants had a smaller reduction. Serial participants had significantly lower risk of both outcomes than lapsed or intermittent participants. Analyses correcting for potential biases made little difference to the results. Conclusion Women participating in the last two breast cancer screening examinations prior to breast cancer diagnosis had the largest reduction in breast cancer death. Missing either one of the last two examinations conferred a significantly higher risk. Published under a CC BY 4.0 license. Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "History A 1-year-old boy was referred for cochlear implant assessment after he received a diagnosis of bilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss at neonatal hearing screening shortly after birth. The child was born at term via uneventful delivery, and there was no history of familial hearing loss or maternal illness. Tympanic membranes were normal, and hearing loss was confirmed with auditory brainstem testing, which showed no response from either ear. Hearing aids were provided from 3 months of age, but no behavioral responses were noted when these were worn. He was also noted to have some mild developmental delay throughout his 1st year of life and was slow to crawl, roll over, and stand up. Physical examination showed no syndromic features or physical abnormalities. Ophthalmology confirmed normal vision and visual movements but bilateral anesthetic corneas. He had corneal abrasions due to minor repeated corneal trauma, and left-sided tarsorraphy was performed at 6 months. Facial nerve function, swallow, and voice quality were normal. To assess suitability for a cochlear implant, the patient underwent MRI of the temporal lobe and brain and thin-section CT of the temporal bones.

        "Purpose To assess the impact of a patient experience improvement program on national ranking in patient experience in a large academic radiology department. Materials and Methods This Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act\u2013compliant study was exempted from institutional review board approval. After initiating an electronic patient experience survey, 26 210 surveys and 22 213 comments were received from May 2017 to April 2018. During the study period, a multifaceted quality improvement initiative was instituted, focused on improving patient experience in the radiology department. The primary outcome was national percentile ranking as measured with the survey. Secondary outcome was the change in departmental percentile ranking compared with the overall hospital ranking for patient experience measured with a similar survey. Results The overall raw score for the department increased from 92.8 to 93.6 of 100 (P < .001), and the national ranking improved from the 35th to 50th percentile (P = .001). Improvements in raw scores related to personnel were primarily responsible for the increase in overall raw score and ranking. Of the 22 213 comments received, 3458 (15.6%) were negative. The percentage of negative comments was highly correlated with lower monthly percentile ranking (Pearson correlation coefficient of \u22120.69; P = .01). Conclusion It is feasible to develop a large-scale electronic survey to assess patient experience in the radiology department, to identify improvement opportunities, and to measurably improve patient experience. Changes in the percentage of negative comments were correlated with changes in a practice's national percentile rank in patient experience. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "History A 6-year-old girl presented with bilateral hearing loss. Her otologic, birth, and family histories were limited, given that she was adopted, but her parents reported that she had had difficulty hearing and speaking ever since they adopted her at 2 years of age. Her parents denied a history of acute otitis media, otorrhea, otalgia, vertigo, autophony, or tinnitus since her adoption. At 2.5 years of age, a diagnosis of hearing loss was made, and she was given hearing aids. Her parents believed that she had been doing well with both receptive and expressive language since she had received the hearing aids. At examination, she had small bilateral preauricular skin tags and normal pinna. Her external auditory canals were of a normal caliber bilaterally, with no otorrhea or lesions. The tympanic membranes were translucent and mobile at pneumatic otoscopy. There was no evidence of a middle ear lesion, nor was there a Schwartz sign. She had no nystagmus or vertigo at pneumatic otoscopy. Audiometry was performed and revealed moderate to severe conductive hearing loss bilaterally, with a mixed component present at 2000 KHz. She had normal bilateral middle ear pressure at tympanometry. Thin-section computed tomography (CT) of the temporal bone was performed.",
        "Purpose To evaluate the performance of an artificial intelligence (AI) tool using a deep learning algorithm for detecting hemorrhage, mass effect, or hydrocephalus (HMH) at non-contrast material-enhanced head computed tomographic (CT) examinations and to determine algorithm performance for detection of suspected acute infarct (SAI). Materials and Methods This HIPAA-compliant retrospective study was completed after institutional review board approval. A training and validation dataset of noncontrast-enhanced head CT examinations that comprised 100 examinations of HMH, 22 of SAI, and 124 of noncritical findings was obtained resulting in 2583 representative images. Examinations were processed by using a convolutional neural network (deep learning) using two different window and level configurations (brain window and stroke window). AI algorithm performance was tested on a separate dataset containing 50 examinations with HMH findings, 15 with SAI findings, and 35 with noncritical findings. Results Final algorithm performance for HMH showed 90% (45 of 50) sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI]: 78%, 97%) and 85% (68 of 80) specificity (95% CI: 76%, 92%), with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.91 with the brain window. For SAI, the best performance was achieved with the stroke window showing 62% (13 of 21) sensitivity (95% CI: 38%, 82%) and 96% (27 of 28) specificity (95% CI: 82%, 100%), with AUC of 0.81. Conclusion AI using deep learning demonstrates promise for detecting critical findings at noncontrast-enhanced head CT. A dedicated algorithm was required to detect SAI. Detection of SAI showed lower sensitivity in comparison to detection of HMH, but showed reasonable performance. Findings support further investigation of the algorithm in a controlled and prospective clinical setting to determine whether it can independently screen noncontrast-enhanced head CT examinations and notify the interpreting radiologist of critical findings. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To address the frequency of identifying nonsolid nodules, diagnosing lung cancer manifesting as such nodules, and the long-term outcome after treatment in a prospective cohort, the International Early Lung Cancer Action Program.A total of 57,496 participants underwent baseline and subsequent annual repeat computed tomographic (CT) screenings according to an institutional review board, HIPAA-compliant protocol. Informed consent was obtained. The frequency of participants with nonsolid nodules, the course of the nodule at follow-up, and the resulting diagnoses of lung cancer, treatment, and outcome are given separately for baseline and annual repeat rounds of screening. The \u03c7(2) statistic was used to compare percentages.A nonsolid nodule was identified in 2392 (4.2%) of 57,496 baseline screenings, and pathologic pursuit led to the diagnosis of 73 cases of adenocarcinoma. A new nonsolid nodule was identified in 485 (0.7%) of 64,677 annual repeat screenings, and 11 had a diagnosis of stage I adenocarcinoma; none were in nodules 15 mm or larger in diameter. Nonsolid nodules resolved or decreased more frequently in annual repeat than in baseline rounds (322 [66%] of 485 vs 628 [26%] of 2392, P < .0001). Treatment of the cases of lung cancer was with lobectomy in 55, bilobectomy in two, sublobar resection in 26, and radiation therapy in one. Median time to treatment was 19 months (interquartile range [IQR], 6-41 months). A solid component had developed in 22 cases prior to treatment (median transition time from nonsolid to part-solid, 25 months). The lung cancer-survival rate was 100% with median follow-up since diagnosis of 78 months (IQR, 45-122 months).Nonsolid nodules of any size can be safely followed with CT at 12-month intervals to assess transition to part-solid. Surgery was 100% curative in all cases, regardless of the time to treatment.",
        "To evaluate the diagnostic performance of multiparametric (MP) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for prostate cancer detection by using transperineal template prostate mapping (TTPM) biopsies as the reference standard and to determine the potential ability of MP MR imaging to identify clinically significant prostate cancer.Institutional review board exemption was granted by the local research ethics committee for this retrospective study. Included were 64 men (mean age, 62 years [range, 40-76]; mean prostate-specific antigen, 8.2 ng/mL [8.2 \u03bcg/L] [range, 2.1-43 ng/mL]), 51 with biopsy-proved cancer and 13 suspected of having clinically significant cancer that was biopsy negative or without prior biopsy. MP MR imaging included T2-weighted, dynamic contrast-enhanced and diffusion-weighted imaging (1.5 T, pelvic phased-array coil). Three radiologists independently reviewed images and were blinded to results of biopsy. Two-by-two tables were derived by using sectors of analysis of four quadrants, two lobes, and one whole prostate. Primary target definition for clinically significant disease necessary to be present within a sector of analysis on TTPM for that sector to be deemed positive was set at Gleason score of 3+4 or more and/or cancer core length involvement of 4 mm or more. Sensitivity, negative predictive value, and negative likelihood ratio were calculated to determine ability of MP MR imaging to rule out cancer. Specificity, positive predictive value, positive likelihood ratio, accuracy (overall fraction correct), and area under receiver operating characteristic curves were also calculated.Twenty-eight percent (71 of 256) of sectors had clinically significant cancer by primary endpoint definition. For primary endpoint definition (\u2265 4 mm and/or Gleason score \u2265 3+4), sensitivity, negative predictive value, and negative likelihood ratios were 58%-73%, 84%-89%, and 0.3-0.5, respectively. Specificity, positive predictive value, and positive likelihood ratios were 71%-84%, 49%-63%, and 2.-3.44, respectively. Area under the curve values were 0.73-0.84.Results of this study indicate that MP MR imaging has a high negative predictive value to rule out clinically significant prostate cancer and may potentially have clinical use in diagnostic pathways of men at risk.",
        "The style and tone of the writing in Radiology has changed over the years since its first publication in 1923. Many of the tonal changes have occurred transiently and likely in relation to political and professional issues in play at a particular time. Others represent more consistent trends in the evolution of the professional writing style. In this report, we analyze the tone of the editorial content from 1923 to 2013 in a historical context as well as progressive changes in readability parameters involving both editorial and technical content.",
        "Background The associations of density measures from the publicly available Laboratory for Individualized Breast Radiodensity Assessment (LIBRA) software with breast cancer have primarily focused on estimates from the contralateral breast at the time of diagnosis. Purpose To evaluate LIBRA measures on mammograms obtained before breast cancer diagnosis and compare their performance to established density measures. Materials and Methods For this retrospective case-control study, full-field digital mammograms in for-processing (raw) and for-presentation (processed) formats were obtained (March 2008 to December 2011) in women who developed breast cancer an average of 2 years later and in age-matched control patients. LIBRA measures included absolute dense area and area percent density (PD) from both image formats. For comparison, dense area and PD were assessed by using the research software (Cumulus), and volumetric PD (VPD) and absolute dense volume were estimated with a commercially available software (Volpara). Density measures were compared by using Spearman correlation coefficients (r), and conditional logistic regression (odds ratios [ORs] and 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) was performed to examine the associations of density measures with breast cancer by adjusting for age and body mass index. Results Evaluated were 437 women diagnosed with breast cancer (median age, 62 years \u00b1 17 [standard deviation]) and 1225 matched control patients (median age, 61 years \u00b1 16). LIBRA PD showed strong correlations with Cumulus PD (r = 0.77-0.84) and Volpara VPD (r = 0.85-0.90) (P < .001 for both). For LIBRA, the strongest breast cancer association was observed for PD from processed images (OR, 1.3; 95% CI: 1.1, 1.5), although the PD association from raw images was not significantly different (OR, 1.2; 95% CI: 1.1, 1.4; P = .25). Slightly stronger breast cancer associations were seen for Cumulus PD (OR, 1.5; 95% CI: 1.3, 1.8; processed images; P = .01) and Volpara VPD (OR, 1.4; 95% CI: 1.2, 1.7; raw images; P = .004) compared with LIBRA measures. Conclusion Automated density measures provided by the Laboratory for Individualized Breast Radiodensity Assessment from raw and processed mammograms correlated with established area and volumetric density measures and showed comparable breast cancer associations. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Background The workflow of breast cancer screening programs could be improved given the high workload and the high number of false-positive and false-negative assessments. Purpose To evaluate if using an artificial intelligence (AI) system could reduce workload without reducing cancer detection in breast cancer screening with digital mammography (DM) or digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). Materials and Methods Consecutive screening-paired and independently read DM and DBT images acquired from January 2015 to December 2016 were retrospectively collected from the C\u00f3rdoba Tomosynthesis Screening Trial. The original reading settings were single or double reading of DM or DBT images. An AI system computed a cancer risk score for DM and DBT examinations independently. Each original setting was compared with a simulated autonomous AI triaging strategy (the least suspicious examinations for AI are not human-read; the rest are read in the same setting as the original, and examinations not recalled by radiologists but graded as very suspicious by AI are recalled) in terms of workload, sensitivity, and recall rate. The McNemar test with Bonferroni correction was used for statistical analysis. Results A total of 15 987 DM and DBT examinations (which included 98 screening-detected and 15 interval cancers) from 15 986 women (mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 58 years \u00b1 6) were evaluated. In comparison with double reading of DBT images (568 hours needed, 92 of 113 cancers detected, 706 recalls in 15 987 examinations), AI with DBT would result in 72.5% less workload (P < .001, 156 hours needed), noninferior sensitivity (95 of 113 cancers detected, P = .38), and 16.7% lower recall rate (P < .001, 588 recalls in 15 987 examinations). Similar results were obtained for AI with DM. In comparison with the original double reading of DM images (222 hours needed, 76 of 113 cancers detected, 807 recalls in 15 987 examinations), AI with DBT would result in 29.7% less workload (P < .001), 25.0% higher sensitivity (P < .001), and 27.1% lower recall rate (P < .001). Conclusion Digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis screening strategies based on artificial intelligence systems could reduce workload up to 70%. Published under a CC BY 4.0 license.",
        "To examine the usefulness of diffusion kurtosis imaging for the diagnosis of Parkinson disease (PD).Examinations were performed with the understanding and written consent of each subject, with local ethics committee approval, and in compliance with national legislation and Declaration of Helsinki guidelines. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 30 patients with idiopathic PD (mean age, 64.5 years \u00b1 3.4 [standard deviation]) and 30 healthy subjects (mean age, 65.0 years \u00b1 5.1). Mean kurtosis, fractional anisotropy, and mean, axial, and radial diffusivity of the basal ganglia were compared between the groups. Disease severity was assessed by using Hoehn and Yahr staging and the motor section of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (mean scores, 2.0 and 33.6, respectively). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to compare the diagnostic accuracies of the indexes of interest. Pearson correlation coefficient analysis was used to correlate imaging findings with disease severity.Mean kurtosis in the putamen was higher in the PD group (0.93 \u00b1 0.15) than in the control group (0.71 \u00b1 0.09) (P < .000416). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.95 for both the ipsilateral putamen and the ipsilateral substantia nigra. The mean kurtosis for the ipsilateral substantia nigra had the best diagnostic performance (mean cutoff, 1.10; sensitivity, 0.92; specificity, 0.87). In contrast, AUCs for the tensor-derived indexes ranged between 0.43 (axial and radial diffusivity in substantia nigra) and 0.65 (fractional anisotropy in substantia nigra).Diffusion kurtosis imaging in the basal ganglia, as compared with conventional diffusion-tensor imaging, can improve the diagnosis of PD."
