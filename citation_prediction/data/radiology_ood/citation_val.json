        "BackgroundThe performance of a deep learning (DL) algorithm should be validated in actual clinical situations, before its clinical implementation.PurposeTo evaluate the performance of a DL algorithm for identifying chest radiographs with clinically relevant abnormalities in the emergency department (ED) setting.Materials and MethodsThis single-center retrospective study included consecutive patients who visited the ED and underwent initial chest radiography between January 1 and March 31, 2017. Chest radiographs were analyzed with a commercially available DL algorithm. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated by determining the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity at predefined operating cutoffs (high-sensitivity and high-specificity cutoffs). The sensitivities and specificities of the algorithm were compared with those of the on-call radiology residents who interpreted the chest radiographs in the actual practice by using McNemar tests. If there were discordant findings between the algorithm and resident, the residents reinterpreted the chest radiographs by using the algorithm's output.ResultsA total of 1135 patients (mean age, 53 years \u00b1 18; 582 men) were evaluated. In the identification of abnormal chest radiographs, the algorithm showed an AUC of 0.95 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.93, 0.96), a sensitivity of 88.7% (227 of 256 radiographs; 95% CI: 84.1%, 92.3%), and a specificity of 69.6% (612 of 879 radiographs; 95% CI: 66.5%, 72.7%) at the high-sensitivity cutoff and a sensitivity of 81.6% (209 of 256 radiographs; 95% CI: 76.3%, 86.2%) and specificity of 90.3% (794 of 879 radiographs; 95% CI: 88.2%, 92.2%) at the high-specificity cutoff. Radiology residents showed lower sensitivity (65.6% [168 of 256 radiographs; 95% CI: 59.5%, 71.4%], P < .001) and higher specificity (98.1% [862 of 879 radiographs; 95% CI: 96.9%, 98.9%], P < .001) compared with the algorithm. After reinterpretation of chest radiographs with use of the algorithm's outputs, the sensitivity of the residents improved (73.4% [188 of 256 radiographs; 95% CI: 68.0%, 78.8%], P = .003), whereas specificity was reduced (94.3% [829 of 879 radiographs; 95% CI: 92.8%, 95.8%], P < .001).ConclusionA deep learning algorithm used with emergency department chest radiographs showed diagnostic performance for identifying clinically relevant abnormalities and helped improve the sensitivity of radiology residents' evaluation.Published under a CC BY 4.0 license.Online supplemental material is available for this article.See also the editorial by Munera and Infante in this issue.",
        "To report the prevalence of qualitative radiographic findings for femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) and associations among them and to characterize the inter- and intraobserver variability of these interpretations.This study is part of an institutional review board-approved population-based prospective follow-up of 2081 of 4006 (participation rate, 51.9%) young adults (874 [42.0%] male participants, 1207 [58.0%] female participants; mean age, 18.6 years) who took part in a randomized hip trial on developmental dysplasia of the hip. All participants gave informed consent. Two pelvic radiographs were obtained. Pistol-grip deformity, focal femoral neck prominence, and flattening of the lateral head, all suggestive of cam-type impingement, and the posterior wall sign, excessive acetabular coverage, and crossover sign, all suggestive of pincer-type impingement, were assessed subjectively by an experienced radiologist. To assess inter- and intraobserver agreement, images from 350 examinations were read independently twice by two observers.Cam-type deformities were seen in 868 male and 1192 female participants, respectively, as follows: pistol-grip deformity, 187 (21.5%) and 39 (3.3%); focal femoral neck prominence, 89 (10.3%) and 31 (2.6%); and flattening of the lateral femoral head, 125 (14.4%) and 74 (6.2%). Pincer-type deformities were seen in the same numbers of male and female participants, respectively, as follows: posterior wall sign, 203 (23.4%) and 131 (11.0%); and excessive acetabular coverage, 127 (14.6%) and 58 (4.9%) (all P < .001, according to sex distribution). The crossover sign was seen in 446 (51.4%) and 542 (45.5%) of the male and female participants, respectively (P = .004). There was a high degree of coexistence (odds ratio [OR] > 2) among most FAI findings. Interobserver agreement was good to very good (\u03ba = 0.74-0.84) in rating cam- and pincer-type findings. Intraobserver agreement was moderate or good (\u03ba = 0.49-0.80) for all findings for both observers.Overall, radiographic FAI findings are quite common in a population of healthy young adults, especially in males, with a high degree of coexistence among most findings (OR > 2).",
        "Purpose To develop a magnetic resonance (MR) imaging approach to noninvasively image quantitative Po2 in the human vitreous. Materials and Methods Human studies were approved by the institutional review board with informed consent obtained from all subjects and were HIPAA compliant. Animal studies were performed with animal care committee approval. An MR imaging method to measure the longitudinal relaxation rate, or R1, of water was implemented with a 3.0-T MR imager. R1 was calibrated in water phantoms at multiple Po2 and temperature conditions (n = 10) and in ex vivo animal vitreous (n = 2). Vitreous Po2 was imaged in three human volunteers (age range, 26\u201328 years) in multiple sessions on separate days to evaluate reproducibility. The effects of temperature and ambient air were evaluated by acquiring data with the eye open and closed. Statistical analysis consisted of t tests, with P less than .05 indicating significant difference. Results Calibrations of phantoms and ex vivo vitreous yielded an R1 association with oxygen of 0.209 sec\u22121 + Po2 \u22c5 2.07 \u00d7 10\u22124 sec\u22121/mm Hg at 37\u00b0C, and an association with temperature (\u0394[1/R1]/\u0394Temperature) of 0.106 sec/\u00b0C \u00b1 0.009 (standard deviation). A difference in R1 was found between the phantoms and vitreous. If uncorrected, vitreal Po2 would be significantly overestimated (P < .001). In vivo human vitreous Po2 maps were spatially heterogeneous, with a whole vitreous Po2 of 16.7 mm Hg \u00b1 6.5 (eye closed). Measurements between open and closed eyes showed spatially dependent R1 differences, which translated to temperature differences of 0.34\u00b0\u20130.83\u00b0C across the eye. Conclusion This study established an MR imaging protocol to image quantitative vitreous Po2 noninvasively and evaluated effects from vitreal macromolecules, temperature gradients, and ambient air on vitreal Po2 values. Measurement of vitreous Po2 with MR imaging has the potential to be used to study eye diseases noninvasively. \u00a9 RSNA, 2012",
        "Purpose To determine improvement in breast cancer detection by using supplemental three-dimensional (3D) automated breast (AB) ultrasonography (US) with screening mammography versus screening mammography alone in asymptomatic women with dense breasts. Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval and written informed consent were obtained for this HIPAA-compliant study. The SomoInsight Study was an observational, multicenter study conducted between 2009 and 2011. A total of 15 318 women (mean age, 53.3 years \u00b1 10 [standard deviation]; range, 25\u201394 years) presenting for screening mammography alone with heterogeneously (50%\u201375%) or extremely (>75%) dense breasts were included, regardless of further risk characterization, and were followed up for 1 year. Participants underwent screening mammography alone followed by an AB US examination; results were interpreted sequentially. McNemar test was used to assess differences in cancer detection. Results Breast cancer was diagnosed at screening in 112 women: 82 with screening mammography and an additional 30 with AB US. Addition of AB US to screening mammography yielded an additional 1.9 detected cancers per 1000 women screened (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2, 2.7; P < .001). Of cancers detected with screening mammography, 62.2% (51 of 82) were invasive versus 93.3% (28 of 30) of additional cancers detected with AB US (P = .001). Of the 82 cancers detected with either screening mammography alone or the combined read, 17 were detected with screening mammography alone. Of these, 64.7% (11 of 17) were ductal carcinoma in situ versus 6.7% (two of 30) of cancers detected with AB US alone. Sensitivity for the combined read increased by 26.7% (95% CI: 18.3%, 35.1%); the increase in the recall rate per 1000 women screened was 284.9 (95% CI: 278.0, 292.2; P < .001). Conclusion Addition of AB US to screening mammography in a generalizable cohort of women with dense breasts increased the cancer detection yield of clinically important cancers, but it also increased the number of false-positive results. \u00a9 RSNA, 2014",
        "The American Board of Radiology (ABR) has provided certification for diagnostic radiologists and other specialists and subspecialists for more than 75 years. The Board certification process is a tangible expression of the social contract between the profession and the public by which the profession enjoys the privilege of self-regulation and the public is assured that it can expect medical professionals to put patients' interests first, guarantees the competence of practitioners, and guards the public health. A primary tool used by the ABR in fulfilling this responsibility is the secure proctored examination. This article sets forth seven standards based on authoritative sources in the field of psychometrics (the science of mental measurements), and explains in each case how the ABR implements that standard. Readers are encouraged to understand that, despite the multiple opinions that may be held, these standards developed over decades by experts using the scientific method should be the central feature in any discussion or critique of examinations given for the privilege of professional practice and for safeguarding the public well-being. \u00a9 American Board of Radiology, 2013",
        "To compare the new \"warp\" sequence (slice-encoding metal artifact correction [SEMAC], view-angle tilting [VAT], and increased bandwidth) for the reduction of both through-plane and in-plane magnetic resonance (MR) artifacts with current optimized MR sequences in patients with total hip arthroplasty (THA).The institutional review board issued a waiver for this study. Forty patients with THA were prospectively included. SEMAC, VAT, and increased bandwidth were applied by using the warp turbo-spin-echo sequence at 1.5 T. Coronal short tau inversion-recovery (STIR)-warp and transverse T1-weighted warp (hereafter, T1-warp) images, as well as standard coronal STIR and transverse T1-weighted sequence images optimized with high bandwidth (STIR-hiBW and T1-hiBW), were acquired. Fifteen additional patients were examined to compare the T1-warp and T1-hiBW sequence with an identical matrix size. Signal void was quantified. Qualitative criteria (distinction of anatomic structures, blurring, and noise) were assessed on a five-point scale (1, no artifacts; 5, not visible due to severe artifacts) by two readers. Abnormal imaging findings were recorded. Quantitative data were analyzed with a t test and qualitative data with a Wilcoxon signed rank test.Signal void around the acetabular component was smaller for STIR-warp than STIR-hiBW images (21.6 cm2 vs 42.4 cm2; P=.0001), and for T1-warp than T1-hiBW images (17.6 cm2 vs 20.2 cm2; P=.0001). Anatomic distinction was better on STIR-warp compared with STIR-hiBW images (1.9-2.8 vs 3.6-4.6; P=.0001), and on T1-warp compared with T1-hiBW images (1.3-2.8 vs 1.8-3.2; P<.002). Distortion, blurring, and noise were lower with warp sequences than with the standard sequences (P=.0001). Almost half of the abnormal imaging findings were missed on STIR-hiBW compared with STIR-warp images (55 vs 105 findings; P=.0001), while T1-hiBW was similar to T1-warp imaging (50 vs 55 findings; P=.06).STIR-warp and T1-warp sequences were significantly better according to quantitative and qualitative image criteria, but a clinically relevant artifact reduction was only present for STIR images.",
        "Background Current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) radiologic literature is dominated by CT, and a detailed description of chest radiography appearances in relation to the disease time course is lacking. Purpose To describe the time course and severity of findings of COVID-19 at chest radiography and correlate these with real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2, nucleic acid. Materials and Methods This is a retrospective study of patients with COVID-19 confirmed by using RT-PCR and chest radiographic examinations who were admitted across four hospitals and evaluated between January and March 2020. Baseline and serial chest radiographs (n = 255) were reviewed with RT-PCR. Correlation with concurrent CT examinations (n = 28) was performed when available. Two radiologists scored each chest radiograph in consensus for consolidation, ground-glass opacity, location, and pleural fluid. A severity index was determined for each lung. The lung scores were summed to produce the final severity score. Results The study was composed of 64 patients (26 men; mean age, 56 years \u00b1 19 [standard deviation]). Of these, 58 patients had initial positive findings with RT-PCR (91%; 95% confidence interval: 81%, 96%), 44 patients had abnormal findings at baseline chest radiography (69%; 95% confidence interval: 56%, 80%), and 38 patients had initial positive findings with RT-PCR testing and abnormal findings at baseline chest radiography (59%; 95% confidence interval: 46%, 71%). Six patients (9%) showed abnormalities at chest radiography before eventually testing positive for COVID-19 with RT-PCR. Sensitivity of initial RT-PCR (91%; 95% confidence interval: 83%, 97%) was higher than that of baseline chest radiography (69%; 95% confidence interval: 56%, 80%) (P = .009). Radiographic recovery (mean, 6 days \u00b1 5) and virologic recovery (mean, 8 days \u00b1 6) were not significantly different (P = .33). Consolidation was the most common finding (30 of 64; 47%) followed by ground-glass opacities (21 of 64; 33%). Abnormalities at chest radiography had a peripheral distribution (26 of 64; 41%) and lower zone distribution (32 of 64; 50%) with bilateral involvement (32 of 64; 50%). Pleural effusion was uncommon (two of 64; 3%). The severity of findings at chest radiography peaked at 10\u201312 days from the date of symptom onset. Conclusion Findings at chest radiography in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 frequently showed bilateral lower zone consolidation, which peaked at 10\u201312 days from symptom onset. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020",
        "P arapneumonic effusion sampling reportedly yields posi- tive cultures in up to 62% of cases in pediatric patients with a normal immune response (1) and as low as 9% in children with compromised immune systems (2).In our experience, pleural fluid sampling yields a much lower rate of positive cultures than previously reported, and we hypothesize its findings do not affect clinical management.This study aims to evaluate the clinical impact of diagnostic thoracentesis in pediatric parapneumonic effusions with the primary outcome being a change in antibiotic management according to pleural fluid microbiologic analysis.",
        "Purpose To compare the diagnostic performance of radiomic analysis (RA) and a convolutional neural network (CNN) to radiologists for classification of contrast agent-enhancing lesions as benign or malignant at multiparametric breast MRI. Materials and Methods Between August 2011 and August 2015, 447 patients with 1294 enhancing lesions (787 malignant, 507 benign; median size, 15 mm \u00b1 20) were evaluated. Lesions were manually segmented by one breast radiologist. RA was performed by using L1 regularization and principal component analysis. CNN used a deep residual neural network with 34 layers. All algorithms were also retrained on half the number of lesions (n = 647). Machine interpretations were compared with prospective interpretations by three breast radiologists. Standard of reference was histologic analysis or follow-up. Areas under the receiver operating curve (AUCs) were used to compare diagnostic performance. Results CNN trained on the full cohort was superior to training on the half-size cohort (AUC, 0.88 vs 0.83, respectively; P = .01), but there was no difference for RA and L1 regularization (AUC, 0.81 vs 0.80, respectively; P = .76) or RA and principal component analysis (AUC, 0.78 vs 0.78, respectively; P = .93). By using the full cohort, CNN performance (AUC, 0.88; 95% confidence interval: 0.86, 0.89) was better than RA and L1 regularization (AUC, 0.81; 95% confidence interval: 0.79, 0.83; P < .001) and RA and principal component analysis (AUC, 0.78; 95% confidence interval: 0.76, 0.80; P < .001). However, CNN was inferior to breast radiologist interpretation (AUC, 0.98; 95% confidence interval: 0.96, 0.99; P < .001). Conclusion A convolutional neural network was superior to radiomic analysis for classification of enhancing lesions as benign or malignant at multiparametric breast MRI. Both approaches were inferior to radiologists' performance; however, more training data will further improve performance of convolutional neural network, but not that of radiomics algorithms. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To evaluate the added value of computer-aided detection (CAD) for lung nodules on chest radiographs when radiologists have bone-suppressed images (BSIs) available.Written informed consent was waived by the institutional review board. Selection of study images and study setup was reviewed and approved by the institutional review boards. Three hundred posteroanterior (PA) and lateral chest radiographs (189 radiographs with negative findings and 111 radiographs with a solitary nodule) in 300 subjects were selected from image archives at four institutions. PA images were processed by using a commercially available CAD, and PA BSIs were generated. Five radiologists and three residents evaluated the radiographs with BSIs available, first, without CAD and, second, after inspection of the CAD marks. Readers marked locations suspicious for a nodule and provided a confidence score for that location to be a nodule. Location-based receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed by using jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic analysis. Area under the curve (AUC) functioned as figure of merit, and P values were computed with the Dorfman-Berbaum-Metz method.Average nodule size was 16.2 mm. Stand-alone CAD reached a sensitivity of 74% at 1.0 false-positive mark per image. Without CAD, average AUC for observers was 0.812. With CAD, performance significantly improved to an AUC of 0.841 (P = .0001). CAD detected 127 of 239 nodules that were missed after evaluation of the radiographs together with BSIs pooled over all observers. Only 57 of these detections were eventually marked by the observers after review of CAD candidates.CAD improved radiologists' performance for the detection of lung nodules on chest radiographs, even when baseline performance was optimized by providing lateral radiographs and BSIs. Still, most of the true-positive CAD candidates are dismissed by observers.",
        "Purpose To compare the subjective Likert score to the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PIRADS) and morphology-location-signal intensity (MLS) scores for categorization of prostate lesions as benign or malignant at multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Materials and Methods Two hundred fifteen patients who underwent T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic contrast material\u2013enhanced multiparametric MR imaging of the prostate before radical prostatectomy were included in a prospective database after they signed the institutional review board\u2013approved forms. Senior readers 1 and 2 prospectively noted the location, shape, and signal intensity of lesions on MR images from individual pulse sequences and scored each for likelihood of malignancy by using a Likert scale (range, 1\u20135). A junior reader (reader 3) retrospectively reviewed the database and did the same analysis. The MLS score (range, 1\u201313) was computed by using the readers' descriptions of the lesions. Then, the three readers again scored the lesions they described by using the PIRADS score (range, 3\u201315). MLS and PIRADS scores were compared with the Likert score by using their areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves. Results Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of the Likert, MLS, and PIRADS scores were 0.81, 0.77 (P = .03), and 0.75 (P = .01) for reader 1; 0.88, 0.74 (P < .0001), and 0.76 (P < .0001) for reader 2; and 0.81, 0.78 (P = .23), and 0.75 (P = .01) for reader 3. For diagnosing cancers with Gleason scores greater than or equal to 7, the Likert score was significantly more accurate than the others, except for the MLS score for reader 3. Weighted \u03ba values were 0.470\u20130.524, 0.405\u20130.430, and 0.378\u20130.441 for the Likert, MLS, and PIRADS scores, respectively. Conclusion The Likert score allowed significantly more accurate categorization of prostate lesions on MR images than did the MLS and PIRADS scores. \u00a9 RSNA, 2014 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To assess the short-term efficacy and safety of ultrasonographically (US)-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation for treatment of benign solid thyroid nodules.This prospective study was approved by the institutional ethics committee, and written informed consent was acquired. HIFU ablation was performed in one session with US guidance and conscious sedation in 20 euthyroid patients (mean age, 44.5 years) with a benign solitary or dominant thyroid nodule. Thyroid nodule volume, US structure, and Doppler pattern were assessed at baseline, at 1 week, and at 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment. Adverse events associated with HIFU were evaluated. Statistical analysis was conducted by using repeated measures analysis of variance, the Student t test, \u03c7(2) test, and correlation analysis.The mean \u00b1 standard deviation nodule volume was 4.96 mL \u00b1 2.79 at the start of the study. Nodule volume had decreased to 3.05 mL \u00b1 1.96 at the 3-month follow-up examination (n = 20, P < .001), and reached 2.91 mL \u00b1 2.43 by the 6-month follow-up examination (n = 16, P < .001). By then, the mean volume reduction was 48.7% \u00b1 24.3 (P < .001). Isoechoic nodules showed greater reduction at 1 month than did hypoechoic nodules (31.6% \u00b1 18.1 vs 16.4% \u00b1 8.6, P = .053). Nodules with markedly increased blood flow showed smaller volume reduction at 3 months than did less-vascularized nodules (10.9% \u00b1 14.5 vs 41.5% \u00b1 20.3, P = .054). Minor transient complications (eg, subcutaneous edema, mild skin redness) were observed in two patients.Early data suggest that US-guided HIFU ablation is an effective and safe procedure for treatment of benign solid thyroid nodules. Initial US echogenicity and vascularization influence the ablation outcome.",
        "To report the results of sweep imaging with Fourier transformation (SWIFT) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for diagnostic breast imaging.Informed consent was obtained from all participants under one of two institutional review board-approved, HIPAA-compliant protocols. Twelve female patients (age range, 19-54 years; mean age, 41.2 years) and eight normal control subjects (age range, 22-56 years; mean age, 43.2 years) enrolled and completed the study from January 28, 2011, to March 5, 2013. Patients had previous lesions that were Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System 4 and 5 based on mammography and/or ultrasonographic imaging. Contrast-enhanced SWIFT imaging was completed by using a 4-T research MR imaging system. Noncontrast studies were completed in the normal control subjects. One of two sized single-breast SWIFT-compatible transceiver coils was used for nine patients and five controls. Three patients and five control subjects used a SWIFT-compatible dual breast coil. Temporal resolution was 5.9-7.5 seconds. Spatial resolution was 1.00 mm isotropic, with later examinations at 0.67 mm isotropic, and dual breast at 1.00 mm or 0.75 mm isotropic resolution.Two nonblinded breast radiologists reported SWIFT image findings of normal breast tissue, benign fibroadenomas (six of six lesions), and malignant lesions (10 of 12 lesions) concordant with other imaging modalities and pathologic reports. Two lesions in two patients were not visualized because of coil field of view. The images yielded by SWIFT showed the presence and extent of known breast lesions.The SWIFT technique could become an important addition to breast imaging modalities because it provides high spatial resolution at all points during the dynamic contrast-enhanced examination.",
        "Purpose To determine if the change in tumor apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) at diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI is predictive of pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. Materials and Methods In this prospective multicenter study, 272 consecutive women with breast cancer were enrolled at 10 institutions (from August 2012 to January 2015) and were randomized to treatment with 12 weekly doses of paclitaxel (with or without an experimental agent), followed by 12 weeks of treatment with four cycles of anthracycline. Each woman underwent breast DW MRI before treatment, at early treatment (3 weeks), at midtreatment (12 weeks), and after treatment. Percentage change in tumor ADC from that before treatment (\u0394ADC) was measured at each time point. Performance for predicting pCR was assessed by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the overall cohort and according to tumor hormone receptor (HR)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) disease subtype. Results The final analysis included 242 patients with evaluable serial imaging data, with a mean age of 48 years \u00b1 10 (standard deviation); 99 patients had HR-positive (hereafter, HR+)/HER2-negative (hereafter, HER2-) disease, 77 patients had HR-/HER2- disease, 42 patients had HR+/HER2+ disease, and 24 patients had HR-/HER2+ disease. Eighty (33%) of 242 patients experienced pCR. Overall, \u0394ADC was moderately predictive of pCR at midtreatment/12 weeks (AUC = 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.52, 0.68; P = .017) and after treatment (AUC = 0.61; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.69; P = .013). Across the four disease subtypes, midtreatment \u0394ADC was predictive only for HR+/HER2- tumors (AUC = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.89; P < .001). In a test subset, a model combining tumor subtype and midtreatment \u0394ADC improved predictive performance (AUC = 0.72; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.83) over \u0394ADC alone (AUC = 0.57; 95% CI: 0.44, 0.70; P = .032.). Conclusion After 12 weeks of therapy, change in breast tumor apparent diffusion coefficient at MRI predicts complete pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Background CT may play a central role in the diagnosis and management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Purpose To perform a longitudinal study to analyze the serial CT findings over time in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Materials and Methods During January 16 to February 17, 2020, 90 patients (33 men, 57 women; mean age, 45 years) with COVID-19 pneumonia were prospectively enrolled and followed up until being discharged, death, or the end of the study. A total of 366 CT scans were acquired and reviewed by two groups of radiologists for the patterns and distribution of lung abnormalities, total CT scores, and number of zones involved. Those features were analyzed for temporal change. Results CT scores and number of zones involved progressed rapidly, peaked during illness days 6-11 (median CT score, 5; median number of zones involved, five), and were followed by persistence of high levels. The predominant pattern of abnormalities after symptom onset was ground-glass opacity (35 of 78 scans [45%] to 49 of 79 scans [62%] in different periods). The percentage of mixed pattern peaked on illness days 12-17 (30 of 78 scans [38%]) and became the second most predominant pattern thereafter. Pure ground-glass opacity was the most prevalent subtype of ground-glass opacity after symptom onset (20 of 50 scans [40%] to 20 of 28 scans [71%]). The percentage of ground-glass opacity with irregular linear opacity peaked on illness days 6-11 (14 of 50 scans [28%]) and became the second most prevalent subtype thereafter. The distribution of lesions was predominantly bilateral and subpleural. Sixty-six of the 70 patients discharged (94%) had residual disease on final CT scans (median CT score, 4; median number of zones involved, four), with ground-glass opacity (42 of 70 patients [60%]) and pure ground-glass opacity (31 of 42 patients [74%]) the most common pattern and subtype. Conclusion The extent of lung abnormalities at CT peaked during illness days 6-11. The temporal changes of the diverse CT manifestations followed a specific pattern, which might indicate the progression and recovery of the illness. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To explore the extent of signal hyperintensity in the brain on unenhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images with increasing gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) doses in patients who received 35 or more linear GBCA administrations. Materials and Methods In this institutional review board-approved HIPAA-compliant retrospective study, picture archiving and communication systems of two tertiary referral hospitals were searched to identify patients who received 35 or more linear GBCA administrations. Unenhanced T1-weighted images of the brain in patients after six, 12, and 24 GBCA administrations and after the final GBCA administration were independently reviewed by three radiologists to identify sites where T1 signal intensity was increasing. Areas identified by all three observers as increasing in T1 signal intensity when compared with baseline images were further analyzed with a quantitative region of interest analysis measuring the rate of signal increase per injection and the total change after 24 linear GBCA administrations relative to reference tissues that did not show T1 shortening. Results Qualitative analysis of 13 patients with 39-59 linear GBCA administrations showed visually detectable T1 shortening in the dentate nucleus (n = 13), globus pallidus (n = 13), substantia nigra (n = 13), posterior thalamus (n = 12), red nucleus (n = 10), colliculi (n = 10), superior cerebellar peduncle (n = 7), caudate nucleus (n = 4), whole thalamus (n = 3), and putamen (n = 2). Quantitative analysis enable confirmation of signal intensity increases on unenhanced T1-weighted images relative to reference tissues in the dentate nucleus (0.53% signal intensity increase per injection, P < .001), globus pallidus (0.23% increase, P = .009), posterior thalamus (0.26% increase, P < .001), substantia nigra (0.25% increase, P = .01), red nucleus (0.25% increase, P = .01), cerebellar peduncle (0.19% increase, P = .001), and colliculi (0.21% increase, P = .02). Conclusion Increased signal intensity on unenhanced T1-weighted images was seen in the posterior thalamus, substantia nigra, red nucleus, cerebellar peduncle, colliculi, dentate nucleus, and globus pallidus. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016.",
        "To develop and validate a fast cardiac magnetic resonance imaging T1 mapping technique with high spatial resolution based on a radial inversion-recovery (IR) spoiled gradient-echo acquisition.Approval for the study was granted by the local institutional review board, and all subjects gave written informed consent. An electrocardiographically triggered radial single-shot IR (TRASSI) sequence was developed in conjunction with a custom-written fitting algorithm. The proposed imaging technique was validated in phantom measurements and then used for cardiac T1 mapping in 62 subjects with or without cardiac disease. The study population included 51 healthy subjects, three patients with arrhythmia, and eight patients with myocardial infarction. The potential heart rate dependency of the TRASSI method was tested by using linear regression analysis. Statistically significant differences between the sexes and various section orientations were analyzed with a Student t test for independent groups and a repeated-measures analysis of variance for dependent groups.High-spatial-resolution T1 maps (1.17 \u00d7 1.17 mm) without motion artifacts and without heart rate dependency (slope = -0.0303, R(2) = 0.0000887, P = .899) were acquired with an acquisition time of less than 6 seconds in all subjects. The mean T1 of healthy left ventricular myocardium across all examined subjects was 1031 msec \u00b1 33 (standard deviation). Testing for reproducibility in three individuals with 34 repetitive measurements revealed a mean standard deviation of 4.1 msec (0.412%). Subacute and chronic myocardial infarction could be detected in all eight patients. T1 disturbances due to arrhythmia proved to be minimal in three patients (standard deviation, <1.2%).Fast and accurate cardiac T1 mapping is feasible within a single-shot IR experiment.",
        "History A 50-year-old woman presented to the emergency department of our hospital with a 2-day history of lower limb pain associated with unusual asthenia and diffuse arthralgia over the past 3 weeks. She was a native of Guinea and had lived in France for most of her life, working as a personal care assistant. Her only medical history of note was an occurrence of fetal death at 12 weeks gestation when she was 35 years old. She had bilateral lower limb swelling, without changes in skin temperature or color. All proximal and distal arterial pulses were felt. General physical examination findings were otherwise unremarkable. Her laboratory tests showed a decreased hemoglobin concentration of 8.9 g/dL (normal range, 12\u201316 g/dL), a decreased platelet count of 45 \u00d7 109/L (normal range, [150\u2013400] \u00d7 109/L), a C-reactive protein level of 158 mg/L (normal range, <5 mg/L), and a d-dimer level of 2000 mg/L (normal range, <500 mg/L]). Compression US of the lower limbs revealed bilateral calf vein thrombosis involving the fibular and posterior tibial veins. Curative anticoagulation using low-molecular-weight heparin (enoxaparin, subcutaneous injection of 100 units per kilogram of body weight twice a day) was started. The day after the start of anticoagulation therapy, the patient reported dyspnea and acute chest and abdominal pain. Her vital signs were assessed, and she had elevated blood pressure and increased heart rate and respiratory rate, but she remained afebrile. Her cardiac auscultation was unremarkable, besides tachycardia. Skin examination revealed small areas of necrosis on the fingertips of her right hand. Laboratory studies were repeated and showed an increase in serum creatinine level from a baseline value of 0.49 mg/dL to a new value of 1.01 mg/dL (normal range, 0.6\u20131.1 mg/dL), an apparition of low-grade proteinuria of 0.43 g per day (normal range, <0.3 g/ day), and a high serum troponin level of 1066 ng/L (normal range, <14 ng/L), whereas electrocardiography showed no ST segment modification and echocardiography revealed a moderately altered left ventricular ejection fraction (45%). There was no coronary occlusion seen at emergency coronarography. Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed (Figs 1, 2) together with cardiac MRI (Figs 3, 4).",
        "HistoryA 34-year-old man presented to the emergency department of our hospital for progressive shortness of breath and worsening productive cough of 2 weeks duration. He reported a 10-kg weight loss over 4 months but denied experiencing fever, chills, night sweats, or gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, or neurologic symptoms. His medical history was unremarkable. Although he was a native of Morocco, he had lived in Europe for many years and worked as a truck driver. The patient had a smoking history but had quit smoking 5 years prior to presentation. He denied alcohol abuse or recreational drug use. He did not have any allergies. Besides bilateral clubbing, the physical examination findings were normal. At the time of admission, he had an oxygen (O2) saturation of 87% at ambient air, which increased to 100% with 1 L of O2 administered via a nasal cannula. The blood sample revealed a slight increase in his hemoglobin concentration (18.7 g/dL; normal range, 13.6-17.2 g/dL) and hematocrit level (50.8%; normal range, 39%-49%). His inflammatory parameters were normal, as were his hepatic and renal function.

        "Purpose To compare the diagnostic performance of breast tomosynthesis versus supplemental mammography views in classification of masses, distortions, and asymmetries. Materials and Methods Eight radiologists who specialized in breast imaging retrospectively reviewed 217 consecutively accrued lesions by using protocols that were HIPAA compliant and institutional review board approved in 182 patients aged 31\u201360 years (mean, 50 years) who underwent diagnostic mammography and tomosynthesis. The lesions in the cohort included 33% (72 of 217) cancers and 67% (145 of 217) benign lesions. Eighty-four percent (182 of 217) of the lesions were masses, 11% (25 of 217) were asymmetries, and 5% (10 of 217) were distortions that were initially detected at clinical examination in 8% (17 of 217), at mammography in 80% (173 of 217), at ultrasonography (US) in 11% (25 of 217), or at magnetic resonance imaging in 1% (2 of 217). Histopathologic examination established truth in 191 lesions, US revealed a cyst in 12 lesions, and 14 lesions had a normal follow-up. Each lesion was interpreted once with tomosynthesis and once with supplemental mammographic views; both modes included the mediolateral oblique and craniocaudal views in a fully crossed and balanced design by using a five-category Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) assessment and a probability-of-malignancy score. Differences between modes were analyzed with a generalized linear mixed model for BI-RADS\u2013based sensitivity and specificity and with modified Obuchowski-Rockette approach for probability-of-malignancy\u2013based area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results Average probability-of-malignancy\u2013based area under the ROC curve was 0.87 for tomosynthesis versus 0.83 for supplemental views (P < .001). With tomosynthesis, the false-positive rate decreased from 85% (989 of 1160) to 74% (864 of 1160) (P < .01) for cases that were rated BI-RADS category 3 or higher and from 57% (663 of 1160) to 48% (559 of 1160) for cases rated BI-RADS category 4 or 5 (P < .01), without a meaningful change in sensitivity. With tomosynthesis, more cancers were classified as BI-RADS category 5 (39% [226 of 576] vs 33% [188 of 576]; P = .017) without a decrease in specificity. Conclusion Tomosynthesis significantly improved diagnostic accuracy for noncalcified lesions compared with supplemental mammographic views. \u00a9 RSNA, 2012",
        "A 29-year-old woman was referred for US of bilateral breasts during evaluation for noncyclical mastalgia predominantly in the left breast of 8 months duration. She had been taking selective serotonin receptor inhibitors for the past 6 months for a clinical diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder. A detailed medical history revealed breast cancer in the patient's mother and grandmother. There was no history of weight loss or appetite loss, nor was there a history of any altered bowel or bladder habits. The patient was overweight, with a body mass index of 26.8 kg/m2, and appeared anxious during the general physical examination, with an increased pulse (102 beats per minute) and normal blood pressure (118/82 mm Hg). Local examination revealed multiple small mobile painful lesions that were palpable in all quadrants of the bilateral breasts, anterior abdominal wall, and forearm. On further questioning, the patient reported similar painful lesions were present in her mother and one brother. Laboratory investigations showed a normal hemoglobin level (12.4 g/dL; normal range, 12-15 g/dL), a total leukocyte count of 9000 cells per microliter (9 cells \u00d7 109/L) (normal range, 4500-11 000 cells per microliter [4.5-11 cells \u00d7 109/L]), a normal differential leukocyte count (74% neutrophils [normal range, 40%-80%], 24% lymphocytes [normal range, 20%-40%], and 2% eosinophils [normal range, 1%-4%]), and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 5 mm per hour (normal range, 0-29 mm per hour). High-frequency US of bilateral breasts (Figs 1, 2) was performed in conjunction with Color Doppler US (Fig 3) and shear-wave elastography of representative lesions in the breasts (Fig 4). Similar lesions were also found in the subcutaneous plane of the right forearm (Fig 5) and the anterior abdominal wall (Fig 6).",
        "To assess diagnostic accuracy with diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) in patients with breast lesions and to evaluate the potential association between DKI-derived parameters and breast cancer clinical-pathologic factors.Institutional review board approval and written informed consent were obtained. Data from 97 patients (mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 45.7 years \u00b1 13.1; range, 19-70 years) with 98 lesions (57 malignant and 41 benign) who were treated between January 2014 and April 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. DKI (with b values of 0-2800 sec/mm(2)) and conventional diffusion-weighted imaging data were acquired. Kurtosis and diffusion coefficients from DKI and apparent diffusion coefficients from diffusion-weighted imaging were measured by two radiologists. Student t test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Jonckheere-Terpstra test, receiver operating characteristic curves, and Spearman correlation were used for statistical analysis.Kurtosis coefficients were significantly higher in the malignant lesions than in the benign lesions (1.05 \u00b1 0.22 vs 0.65 \u00b1 0.11, respectively; P < .0001). Diffusivity and apparent diffusion coefficients in the malignant lesions were significantly lower than those in the benign lesions (1.13 \u00b1 0.27 vs 1.97 \u00b1 0.33 and 1.02 \u00b1 0.18 vs 1.48 \u00b1 0.33, respectively; P < .0001). Significantly higher specificity for differentiation of malignant from benign lesions was shown with the use of kurtosis and diffusivity coefficients than with the use of apparent diffusion coefficients (83% [34 of 41] and 83% [34 of 41] vs 76% [31 of 41], respectively; P < .0001) with equal sensitivity (95% [54 of 57]). In patients with invasive breast cancer, kurtosis was positively correlated with tumor histologic grade (r = 0.75) and expression of the Ki-67 protein (r = 0.55). Diffusivity was negatively correlated with tumor histologic grades (r = -0.44) and Ki-67 expression (r = -0.46).DKI showed higher specificity than did conventional diffusion-weighted imaging for assessment of benign and malignant breast lesions. Patients with grade 3 breast cancer or tumors with high expression of Ki-67 were associated with higher kurtosis and lower diffusivity coefficients; however, this association must be confirmed in prospective studies.",
        "Background Women are increasingly delaying childbearing, and thus lactation, into their 30s and 40s, when mammography would typically be the initial imaging modality to evaluate palpable masses in the general population. Current guidelines recommend US as the first-line imaging modality for palpable masses in pregnant and lactating women, but data regarding breastfeeding women age 30 years and older are near nonexistent. Purpose To evaluate the diagnostic performance of targeted US as the primary imaging modality for the evaluation of palpable masses in lactating women, including those of advanced maternal age. Materials and Methods Lactating women with palpable breast masses evaluated at targeted US over a 17-year period (January 2000 to July 2017) were retrospectively identified. All US evaluations were performed at diagnostic evaluation, and mammography was performed at the discretion of the interpreting radiologist. Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System assessments, imaging, and pathology results were collected. Descriptive statistics and 2 \u00d7 2 contingency tables were assessed at the patient level. Results There were 167 women (mean age, 35 years \u00b1 5 [standard deviation]), 101 of whom (60%) were of advanced maternal age (\u226535 years). All women underwent targeted US, and 98 (59%) underwent mammography in addition to US. The frequency of malignancy was five of 167 (3.0%). Targeted US demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity of five of five (100%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 48%, 100%) and 114 of 162 (70%; 95% CI: 63%, 77%), respectively. Negative predictive value, positive predictive value of an abnormal examination, and positive predictive value of biopsy were 114 of 114 (100%; 95% CI: 97%, 100%), five of 53 (9.4%; 95% CI: 3%, 21%), and five of 50 (10%; 95% CI: 3%, 22%), respectively. In the subset of 98 women who underwent mammography in addition to US, mammography depicted seven incidental suspicious findings, which lowered the specificity from 62 of 93 (67%; 95% CI: 56%, 76%) to 57 of 93 (61%; 95% CI: 51%, 71%) (P = .02). Conclusion Targeted US depicted all malignancies in lactating women with palpable masses. Adding mammography increased false-positive findings without any additional cancer diagnoses. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020 See also the editorial by Newell in this issue.",
        "To estimate the risk of nerve injuries and assess outcomes after sodium tetradecyl sulfate (STS) sclerotherapy of venous malformations (VMs) in children.Sclerotherapy is the treatment of choice for most VMs, but all sclerotherapy agents are associated with the risk of complications. Neuropathy is considered a rare but potentially serious complication of venous sclerotherapy. The institutional review board waived ethical approval for this retrospective review, in which 647 sclerotherapy procedures were performed in 204 patients (104 female and 100 male patients; mean age, 9 years 6 months [range, 6 months to 17 years 11 months]) as treatment for symptomatic VMs. Technical and clinical success of the treatment was evaluated. Complications were reviewed with a particular focus on nerve injury. Informed consent, specifying the risk of neuropathy, as well as pain, swelling, infection, risks of anesthesia, skin injury, nonresolution or worsening of symptoms, and possible need for further or multiple procedures, was obtained for all patients. Standard sclerotherapy techniques were used. Technical details of all procedures were recorded prospectively. Follow-up included immediate postprocedural assessment and outpatient clinic review. All nerve injuries were recorded. Patients were monitored and treated according to clinical need. Confidence intervals were calculated by using the Wilson method, without correction for continuity.Treatment was technically successful in 197 of 204 patients (96.6%), and clinical success was achieved in 174 of 204 (85.3%). Thirty-seven of the 647 procedures (5.7%) resulted in a complication, including 11 cases of excessive swelling, nine cases of skin injury, two patients with infection, and two with pain. Motor and/or sensory nerve injuries occurred after seven procedures (1.1%). Five of the seven children had undergone at least one previous sclerotherapy procedure. Neuropathy resolved spontaneously in four patients and partially recovered in three, of whom two underwent surgery. Surgery included debridement of necrotic tissue, carpal tunnel decompression, and external neurolysis.Nerve injury is an unusual but not rare complication of STS sclerotherapy. A degree of recovery, which may be complete, can be expected in most patients.",
        "Background Men suspected of having clinically significant prostate cancer (sPC) increasingly undergo prostate MRI. The potential of deep learning to provide diagnostic support for human interpretation requires further evaluation. Purpose To compare the performance of clinical assessment to a deep learning system optimized for segmentation trained with T2-weighted and diffusion MRI in the task of detection and segmentation of lesions suspicious for sPC. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, T2-weighted and diffusion prostate MRI sequences from consecutive men examined with a single 3.0-T MRI system between 2015 and 2016 were manually segmented. Ground truth was provided by combined targeted and extended systematic MRI-transrectal US fusion biopsy, with sPC defined as International Society of Urological Pathology Gleason grade group greater than or equal to 2. By using split-sample validation, U-Net was internally validated on the training set (80% of the data) through cross validation and subsequently externally validated on the test set (20% of the data). U-Net-derived sPC probability maps were calibrated by matching sextant-based cross-validation performance to clinical performance of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS). Performance of PI-RADS and U-Net were compared by using sensitivities, specificities, predictive values, and Dice coefficient. Results A total of 312 men (median age, 64 years; interquartile range [IQR], 58-71 years) were evaluated. The training set consisted of 250 men (median age, 64 years; IQR, 58-71 years) and the test set of 62 men (median age, 64 years; IQR, 60-69 years). In the test set, PI-RADS cutoffs greater than or equal to 3 versus cutoffs greater than or equal to 4 on a per-patient basis had sensitivity of 96% (25 of 26) versus 88% (23 of 26) at specificity of 22% (eight of 36) versus 50% (18 of 36). U-Net at probability thresholds of greater than or equal to 0.22 versus greater than or equal to 0.33 had sensitivity of 96% (25 of 26) versus 92% (24 of 26) (both P > .99) with specificity of 31% (11 of 36) versus 47% (17 of 36) (both P > .99), not statistically different from PI-RADS. Dice coefficients were 0.89 for prostate and 0.35 for MRI lesion segmentation. In the test set, coincidence of PI-RADS greater than or equal to 4 with U-Net lesions improved the positive predictive value from 48% (28 of 58) to 67% (24 of 36) for U-Net probability thresholds greater than or equal to 0.33 (P = .01), while the negative predictive value remained unchanged (83% [25 of 30] vs 83% [43 of 52]; P > .99). Conclusion U-Net trained with T2-weighted and diffusion MRI achieves similar performance to clinical Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System assessment. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Purpose To investigate neural substrates underlying attention deficit in patients with chronic subcortical stroke by combining voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) and diffusion-tensor (DT) tractography. Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval and written informed consent were obtained. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging data were prospectively acquired from August 1, 2014, to March 30, 2015, in 49 patients (32 men, 17 women; mean age, 55.7 years \u00b1 8.0; age range, 40-71 years) with subcortical infarctions in the basal ganglia and neighboring regions and 52 control subjects (30 men, 22 women; mean age, 54.4 years \u00b1 7.5; age range, 40-68 years). A modified version of the attention network test was used to assess visual attention function. On the basis of the lesion map at the acute stage, VLSM was used to identify lesion locations related to attention deficit in patients with stroke. DT tractography then was used to determine the responsible impaired connections by using diffusion data at the chronic stage (>6 months after stroke). Results When compared with control subjects, patients with chronic stroke exhibited prolonged reaction time (RT) of correct responses (P = .009). VLSM revealed that acute stroke lesion in the right caudate nucleus and nearby white matter (found in seven patients) was correlated with the prolonged RT (P < .05). DTT showed that the responsible lesion was located in the right thalamic- and caudate-prefrontal pathways in control subjects. The subgroup with right-sided brain damage had significantly decreased fractional anisotropy in these pathways (P < .001), which were correlated with the prolonged RT (P = .009 for the thalamic-prefrontal pathway, P < .001 for the caudate-prefrontal pathway). Conclusion Thalamic-prefrontal and caudate-prefrontal pathways impaired by stroke lesions appear to underlie attention deficit in patients with subcortical stroke in the right hemisphere.",
        "To retrospectively evaluate the adherence of radiologists to the 2010 Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound (SRU) guidelines for management of adnexal cysts.One radiologist reviewed the interpreting radiologists' reports for 398 adnexal cysts detected at ultrasonography in 398 patients (mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 41.1 years \u00b1 14.3; range, 18-87 years) and classified the management recommendations according to adherence to SRU guidelines. Recommendations that were not adherent were classified as overmanagement, undermanagement, or incomplete. The effects of menopausal status, cyst size and other features, and the individual interpreting radiologist on adherence were assessed by using \u03c7(2) tests, and the association of these factors with over- and undermanagement was identified.Overall adherence was 59%; overmanagement, 27%; undermanagement, 9%; and incomplete, 6%. Menopausal status, cyst size, and other cyst features significantly affected adherence (P < .001). For evaluation of premenopausal patients, adherence was 63% (overmanagement, 30%) and of postmenopausal patients, 42% (undermanagement, 26%). For evaluation of cysts 1-3 cm in size, adherence was 65% (overmanagement, 21%); for cysts 3-5 cm, 33% (overmanagement, 49%); for cysts 5-7 cm, 47% (overmanagement, 20%); for cysts larger than 7 cm, 77% (over- and undermanagement, 12% each). Recommendations were adherent in most instances for corpora lutea (88%), simple cysts (56%), and cysts suggestive of benign diagnosis (60%), or with a nodule or multiple thin or thick septations (60%-100%). Cysts with recommentations for overmanagement in most instances were hemorrhagic (59%) and those with a single thin septation (67%); 31% of cysts measuring 1-7 cm in postmenopausal patients were undermanaged. Adherence varied significantly among radiologists (40%-75% adherence among radiologists who interpreted 20 or more examinations; P = .004).Adherence to SRU guidelines for management of adnexal cysts at our institution was 59%. Overmanagement generally occurred for physiologic cysts in premenopausal patients; undermanagement was observed for simple cysts in postmenopausal patients.",
        "Purpose To investigate whether qualitative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging assessments of background parenchymal enhancement (BPE), amount of fibroglandular tissue (FGT), and mammographic density are associated with risk of developing breast cancer in women who are at high risk. Materials and Methods In this institutional review board\u2013approved HIPAA-compliant retrospective study, all screening breast MR images obtained from January 2006 to December 2011 in women aged 18 years or older and at high risk for but without a history of breast cancer were identified. Women in whom breast cancer was diagnosed after index MR imaging comprised the cancer cohort, and one-to-one matching (age and BRCA status) of each woman with breast cancer to a control subject was performed by using MR images obtained in women who did not develop breast cancer with follow-up time maximized. Amount of BPE, BPE pattern (peripheral vs central), amount of FGT at MR imaging, and mammographic density were assessed on index images. Imaging features were compared between cancer and control cohorts by using conditional logistic regression. Results Twenty-three women at high risk (mean age, 47 years \u00b1 10 [standard deviation]; six women had BRCA mutations) with no history of breast cancer underwent screening breast MR imaging; in these women, a diagnosis of breast cancer (invasive, n = 12; in situ, n = 11) was made during the follow-up interval. Women with mild, moderate, or marked BPE were nine times more likely to receive a diagnosis of breast cancer during the follow-up interval than were those with minimal BPE (P = .007; odds ratio = 9.0; 95% confidence interval: 1.1, 71.0). BPE pattern, MR imaging amount of FGT, and mammographic density were not significantly different between the cohorts (P = .5, P = .5, and P = .4, respectively). Conclusion Greater BPE was associated with a higher probability of developing breast cancer in women at high risk for cancer and warrants further study. \u00a9 RSNA, 2015 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To assess the feasibility of hybrid imaging of the heart with fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) on an integrated 3-T positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance (MR) imaging system.The present study was approved by the local institutional review board. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients before imaging. Twenty consecutive patients with myocardial infarction (n = 20) underwent cardiac PET/MR imaging examination. Ten patients underwent additional cardiac PET/computed tomography (CT) before PET/MR. Two-dimensional half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin-echo sequences, balanced steady-state free precession cine sequences, two-dimensional turbo inversion-recovery magnitude T2-weighted sequences, and late gadolinium-enhanced (LGE) segmented two-dimensional inversion-recovery turbo fast low-angle shot sequences were performed. According to the 17-segment model, PET tracer uptake, wall motion, and late gadolinium enhancement were visually assessed for each segment on a binary scale, and categorical intermethod agreement was calculated by using the Cohen \u03ba. The maximum standardized uptake value was measured in corresponding myocardial locations on PET/CT and PET/MR images.Agreement was substantial over all patients and segments between PET and LGE images (\u03ba = 0.76) and between PET and cine images (\u03ba = 0.78). In 306 segments, 97 (32%) were rated as infarcted on PET images, compared with 93 (30%) rated as infarcted on LGE images and with 90 (29%) rated as infarcted on cine images. In a subgroup of patients (n = 10) with an additional PET/CT scan, no significant difference in myocardial tracer uptake between PET/CT and PET/MR images was found (paired t test, P = .95).Cardiac PET/MR imaging with FDG is feasible and may add complementary information in patients with ischemic heart disease.",
        "BACKGROUND: Doppler ultrasound has emerged as the procedure of choice for monitoring the feto-placental circulation. Non-invasive, requiring no ionising radiation and with no known biohazard effects to both mother and foetus; In pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH); where a decreased placental perfusion causes intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), it can identify fetuses at risk for adverse outcome.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this research was to study the umbilical artery with Doppler ultrasound in pregnant women with PIH; and relate the umbilical artery Doppler findings to obstetric outcome.METHODS: A prospective study which involved the determination of the umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry values Systolic/Diastolic ratio (S/D), Pulsatility Index (PI), Resistivity Index (RI), its waveforms patterns in singleton foetuses of 140 pregnancy women between 24-36weeks\u2019 of gestation. The duration of the study which was carried out in the Department of Radiodiagnosis, LUTH was one year and a half.RESULTS: Data was analysed with SPSS version 18. The presence of adverse foetal and neonatal outcomes was found to be associated with worsening umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry indices. A relationship was demonstrated between abnormal Doppler ultrasonography and the occurrence of abnormal perinatal outcomes. PI was the most accurate in the prediction of intrauterine demise with an area under the curve (AUC) of 82.5% (sensitivity of 90.0% sand specificity of 66.2%).CONCLUSION: Ultrasonography is a useful tool in predicting at risk foetuses in PIH, enabling early intervention which in more technologically advanced environment has significantly reduced maternal and foetal morbidity and mortality Therefore, its use should be encouraged in our environment.KEYWORDS: PIH; IUGR; Umbilical Artery Doppler, AUC.",
        "Background: Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is the most common genetic cause of illness and death in the world, with Africa bearing the highest burden. Trans-cranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) which is different from transfontanelle ultrasound, was used to measure mean flow velocities in the large intra-cranial arteries. It is a readily available, economical, reliable, non invasive method of imaging and has been shown to predict risk of stroke when cerebral blood flow velocity> 200cm/s.\r\nAim & Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the common findings in TCD in children with Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA) in this environment, the associated various risk factors and to identify the high risk patients who are likely to have primary stroke.\r\nMaterials and Methods: This prospective study was conducted on 200 children with SCA, without a known history of stroke, at the Sickle Cell Foundation Nigeria, Lagos over a period of 6 months. A TCD machine - DWL Doppler box (Scan Med) s/n DB-0563, p/n 301748 \u00ae manufactured in Germany and equipped with a 2MHz transducer probe was used to measure the cerebral blood flow (CBFv) in internal carotid artery (ICA), middle cerebral artery (MCA) and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanterior cerebral artery (ACA).

        "Purpose To compare two technical approaches for determination of coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography\u2013derived fractional flow reserve (FFR)\u2014FFR derived from coronary CT angiography based on computational fluid dynamics (hereafter, FFRCFD) and FFR derived from coronary CT angiography based on machine learning algorithm (hereafter, FFRML)\u2014against coronary CT angiography and quantitative coronary angiography (QCA). Materials and Methods A total of 85 patients (mean age, 62 years \u00b1 11 [standard deviation]; 62% men) who had undergone coronary CT angiography followed by invasive FFR were included in this single-center retrospective study. FFR values were derived on-site from coronary CT angiography data sets by using both FFRCFD and FFRML. The performance of both techniques for detecting lesion-specific ischemia was compared against visual stenosis grading at coronary CT angiography, QCA, and invasive FFR as the reference standard. Results On a per-lesion and per-patient level, FFRML showed a sensitivity of 79% and 90% and a specificity of 94% and 95%, respectively, for detecting lesion-specific ischemia. Meanwhile, FFRCFD resulted in a sensitivity of 79% and 89% and a specificity of 93% and 93%, respectively, on a per-lesion and per-patient basis (P = .86 and P = .92). On a per-lesion level, the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.89 for FFRML and 0.89 for FFRCFD showed significantly higher discriminatory power for detecting lesion-specific ischemia compared with that of coronary CT angiography (AUC, 0.61) and QCA (AUC, 0.69) (all P < .0001). Also, on a per-patient level, FFRML (AUC, 0.91) and FFRCFD (AUC, 0.91) performed significantly better than did coronary CT angiography (AUC, 0.65) and QCA (AUC, 0.68) (all P < .0001). Processing time for FFRML was significantly shorter compared with that of FFRCFD (40.5 minutes \u00b1 6.3 vs 43.4 minutes \u00b1 7.1; P = .042). Conclusion The FFRML algorithm performs equally in detecting lesion-specific ischemia when compared with the FFRCFD approach. Both methods outperform accuracy of coronary CT angiography and QCA in the detection of flow-limiting stenosis. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018",
        "To investigate the feasibility of magnetic resonance (MR) electric impedance tomography ( EIT electric impedance tomography ) technique for in situ monitoring of electric field distribution during in vivo electroporation of mouse tumors to predict reversibly electroporated tumor areas.All experiments received institutional animal care and use committee approval. Group 1 consisted of eight tumors that were used for determination of predicted area of reversibly electroporated tumor cells with MR EIT electric impedance tomography by using a 2.35-T MR imager. In addition, T1-weighted images of tumors were acquired to determine entrapment of contrast agent within the reversibly electroporated area. A correlation between predicted reversible electroporated tumor areas as determined with MR EIT electric impedance tomography and areas of entrapped MR contrast agent was evaluated to verify the accuracy of the prediction. Group 2 consisted of seven tumors that were used for validation of radiologic imaging with histopathologic staining. Histologic analysis results were then compared with predicted reversible electroporated tumor areas from group 1. Results were analyzed with Pearson correlation analysis and one-way analysis of variance.Mean coverage \u00b1 standard deviation of tumors with electric field that leads to reversible electroporation of tumor cells obtained with MR EIT electric impedance tomography (38% \u00b1 9) and mean fraction of tumors with entrapped MR contrast agent (41% \u00b1 13) were correlated (Pearson analysis, r = 0.956, P = .005) and were not statistically different (analysis of variance, P = .11) from mean fraction of tumors from group 2 with entrapped fluorescent dye (39% \u00b1 12).MR EIT electric impedance tomography can be used for determining electric field distribution in situ during electroporation of tissue. Implementation of MR EIT electric impedance tomography in electroporation-based applications, such as electrochemotherapy and irreversible electroporation tissue ablation, would enable corrective interventions before the end of the procedure and would additionally improve the treatment outcome.",
        "Purpose To test the impact of existing Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 2 (V2) decision rules, as well as of proposed adjustments to these decision rules, on detection of Gleason score (GS) 7 or greater (GS \u22657) prostate cancer. Materials and Methods Two radiologists independently provided PI-RADS V2 scores for the dominant lesion on 343 prostate magnetic resonance (MR) examinations. Diagnostic performance for GS \u22657 tumor was assessed by using MR imaging-ultrasonography fusion-targeted biopsy as the reference. The impact of existing PI-RADS V2 decision rules, as well as a series of exploratory proposed adjustments, on the frequency of GS \u22657 tumor detection, was evaluated. Results A total of 210 lesions were benign, 43 were GS 6, and 90 were GS \u22657. Lesions were GS \u22657 in 0%-4.1% of PI-RADS categories 1 and 2, 11.4%-27.1% of PI-RADS category 3, 44.4%-49.3% of PI-RADS category 4, and 72.1%-73.7% of PI-RADS category 5 lesions. PI-RADS category 4 or greater had sensitivity of 78.9%-87.8% and specificity of 75.5%-79.1 for detecting GS \u22657 tumor. The frequency of GS \u22657 tumor for existing PI-RADS V2 decision rules was 30.0%-33.3% in peripheral zone (PZ) lesions upgraded from category 3 to 4 based on dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) score of positive; 50.0%-66.7% in transition zone (TZ) lesions upgraded from category 3 to 4 based on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) score of 5; and 71.7%-72.7% of lesions in both zones upgraded from category 4 to 5 based on size of 15 mm or greater. The frequency of GS \u22657 tumor for proposed adjustments to the decision rules was 30.0%-60.0% for TZ lesions upgraded from category 3 to 4 based on DWI score of 4; 33.3%-57.1% for TZ lesions upgraded from category 3 to 4 based on DCE score of positive when incorporating new criteria (unencapsulated sheetlike enhancement) for DCE score of positive in TZ; and 56.4%-61.9% for lesions in both zones upgraded from category 4 to 5 based on size of 10-14 mm. Other proposed adjustments yielded GS \u22657 tumor in less than 15% of cases for one or more readers. Conclusion Existing PI-RADS V2 decision rules exhibited reasonable performance in detecting GS \u22657 tumor. Several proposed adjustments to the criteria (in TZ, upgrading category 3 to 4 based on DWI score of 4 or modified DCE score of positive; in PZ or TZ, upgrading category 4 to 5 based on size of 10-14 mm) may also have value for this purpose. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To determine whether liver function correlating with indocyanine green (ICG) clearance could be estimated quantitatively from gadoxetate disodium-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) images.This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and the requirement for informed consent was waived. Twenty-three consecutive patients who underwent an ICG clearance test and gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MR imaging with the same parameters as were used for a preoperative examination were chosen. The hepatocellular uptake index (HUI) from liver volume (V(L))and mean signal intensity of the liver on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images with fat suppression (L(20)) and mean signal intensity of the spleen on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images with fat suppression (S(20)) on 3D gradient-echo T1-weighted images with fat suppression obtained at 20 minutes after gadoxetate disodium (0.025 mmol per kilogram of body weight) administration was determined with the following equation: V(L)[(L(20)/S(20)) - 1]. The correlation of the plasma disappearance rate of ICG (ICG-PDR) and various factors derived from MR imaging, including HUI, iron and fat deposition in the liver and spleen, and spleen volume (V(S)), were evaluated with stepwise multiple regression analysis. The difference between the ratio of the remnant HUI to the HUI of the total liver (rHUI/HUI) and ratio of the liver remnant V(L) to the total V(L) (rV(L)/V(L)) was evaluated in four patients who had segmental heterogeneity of liver function.HUI and V(S) were the factors significantly correlated with ICG-PDR (R = 0.87). The mean value and its 95% confidence interval were 0.18 and 0.01 to 0.34, respectively, for the following calculation: (rHUI/HUI) - (rV(L)/V(L)).The liver function correlating with ICG-PDR can be estimated quantitatively from the signal intensities and the volumes of the liver and spleen on gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MR images, which may improve the estimation of segmental liver function.",

        "History A 44-year-old woman who was a resident of Bihar, which is a state in eastern India, presented to the surgical outpatient department of our hospital with a history of gradually increasing swelling of the right breast associated with redness, pain, and itching over the past month (Fig 1). She reported a general sense of malaise and experienced episodes of chills over the past 6 months; however, she had no documented fever. There was no history of breast trauma. No history suggestive of a possible hypercoagulable state could be elicited (she was a nonsmoker, had undergone uncomplicated normal vaginal delivery 15 years earlier, was not taking oral contraceptives, and had no history to suggest past deep venous thrombosis). General physical examination findings were unremarkable. On local examination, she was found to have diffuse enlargement of the right breast. The skin over the lateral part of the breast was erythematous and showed the presence of prominent superficial veins. On palpation, few ill-defined firm mobile masses were found in the upper outer quadrant with overlying skin induration. No skin ulceration or nipple discharge was present. Few firm and discrete lymph nodes were palpable in the right axilla. Laboratory investigations showed mild anemia (hemoglobin level, 10 g/dL; normal range, 12-15 g/dL), a total leukocyte count of 14 000 cells per microliter (14 cells \u00d7 109/L) (normal range, 4500-11 000 cells per microliter [4.5-11 cells \u00d7 109/L]), a normal differential leukocyte count (74% neutrophils [normal range, 40%-80%], 24% lymphocytes [normal range, 20%-40%], and 2% eosinophils [normal range, 1%-4%]), and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 31 mm per hour (normal range, 0-29 mm per hour). She underwent both mammography (Fig 2) and US (Fig 3). Real-time US showed mobile structures on the series of US images obtained seconds apart (Fig 4). On the basis of the imaging findings, US-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology was performed to confirm the diagnosis, and appropriate treatment was instituted.",
        "Purpose To characterize clinically important prostate cancers missed at multiparametric (MP) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Materials and Methods The local institutional review board approved this HIPAA-compliant retrospective single-center study, which included 100 consecutive patients who had undergone MP MR imaging and subsequent radical prostatectomy. A genitourinary pathologist blinded to MP MR findings outlined prostate cancers on whole-mount pathology slices. Two readers correlated mapped lesions with reports of prospectively read MP MR images. Readers were blinded to histopathology results during prospective reading. At histopathologic examination, 80 clinically unimportant lesions (<5 mm; Gleason score, 3+3) were excluded. The same two readers, who were not blinded to histopathologic findings, retrospectively reviewed cancers missed at MP MR imaging and assigned a Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 2 score to better understand false-negative lesion characteristics. Descriptive statistics were used to define patient characteristics, including age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, PSA density, race, digital rectal examination results, and biopsy results before MR imaging. Student t test was used to determine any demographic differences between patients with false-negative MP MR imaging findings and those with correct prospective identification of all lesions. Results Of the 162 lesions, 136 (84%) were correctly identified with MP MR imaging. Size of eight lesions was underestimated. Among the 26 (16%) lesions missed at MP MR imaging, Gleason score was 3+4 in 17 (65%), 4+3 in one (4%), 4+4 in seven (27%), and 4+5 in one (4%). Retrospective PI-RADS version 2 scores were assigned (PI-RADS 1, n = 8; PI-RADS 2, n = 7; PI-RADS 3, n = 6; and PI-RADS 4, n = 5). On a per-patient basis, MP MR imaging depicted clinically important prostate cancer in 99 of 100 patients. At least one clinically important tumor was missed in 26 (26%) patients, and lesion size was underestimated in eight (8%). Conclusion Clinically important lesions can be missed or their size can be underestimated at MP MR imaging. Of missed lesions, 58% were not seen or were characterized as benign findings at second-look analysis. Recognition of the limitations of MP MR imaging is important, and new approaches to reduce this false-negative rate are needed. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To compare the histologic prognostic feature of invasive breast cancer with mean stiffness as measured with shear-wave elastography.This retrospective study was exempted from ethical committee review. Patient consent for use of images for research was obtained. The study group comprised 101 consecutive women (age range, 38-91 years) with solid lesions identified during routine breast ultrasonography (US) performed between April 2010 and March 2011 and subsequently confirmed at histologic examination to be invasive cancers. Four elastographic images in two orthogonal planes were obtained of each lesion, and mean stiffness values were obtained from each image. Histologic findings following surgery were used for comparison, namely histologic grade, tumor type, invasive size, vascular invasion status, and lymph node status. Relationship between mean stiffness and histologic parameters was investigated by using a general linear model and multiple regression analysis.High histologic grade (P < .0001), large invasive size (P < .0001), lymph node involvement (P < .0001), tumor type (P < .0001), and vascular invasion (P = .0077) all showed statistically significant positive association with high mean stiffness values. Multiple linear regression indicated that invasive size is the strongest pathologic determinant of mean stiffness (P < .0001), with histologic grade also having significant influence (P = .022).In this study, breast cancers with higher mean stiffness values at shear-wave elastography had poorer prognostic features.",
        "To compare magnetic resonance (MR) quantitative equilibrium signal (qS0) mapping with quantitative computed tomography (CT) in the estimation of emphysema in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).Written informed consent of the original study permitted future reanalysis of data. This study was a retrospective analysis of data from an institutional review board-approved study. Twenty-four patients with COPD and 12 healthy patients who did not smoke underwent spirometry and two separate 1.5-T MR imaging examinations. All patients with COPD underwent additional chest CT. Lung MR qS0 maps were generated from MR images obtained with multiple inversion times by fitting the inversion recovery signal equation. Mean, 15th percentile, and standard deviation of whole-lung qS0 and relative lung area with a qS0 value below 0.20 (RA0.20) were measured and compared between groups with an unpaired t test. Reproducibility between two examinations was tested with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), and their associations with spirometry and CT measurements of 15th percentile attenuation (PA15) and relative lung area with attenuation below -950 HU (RA-950) were assessed with the Pearson correlation coefficient.Whole-lung mean qS0 and 15th percentile of qS0 were significantly lower, whereas RA0.20 and standard deviation of qS0 were significantly higher in patients with COPD than in healthy control subjects (P = .014, P = .002, P = .005, and P < .001, respectively). Whole-lung mean qS0, the 15th percentile of qS0, and RA0.20 strongly correlated with RA-950 (r = -0.78, r = -0.81, and r = 0.86, respectively; P < .001) and PA15 (r = 0.78, r = 0.79, and r = -0.71, respectively; P < .001) and moderately correlated with the ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) to forced vital capacity (r = 0.63, r = 0.67, and r = -0.60, respectively; P < .001) and percentage predicted FEV1 (r = 0.54, r = 0.62, and r = -0.56, respectively; P \u2264 .001). Good reproducibility of qS0 readouts was found in both groups (ICC range, 0.89-0.98).Lung MR qS0 mapping may be a reliable noncontrast nonradiation alternative to CT in the assessment of emphysema in patients with COPD.",
        "To develop high-spatial-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) microangiography techniques to image the rat ocular circulation.Animal experiments were performed with institutional Animal Care Committee approval. MR microangiography (resolution, 84\u00d784\u00d784 \u03bcm or 42\u00d742\u00d784 \u03bcm) of the rat eye (eight rats) was performed by using a custom-made small circular surface coil with an 11.7-T MR unit before and after monocrystalline iron oxide nanoparticle (MION) injection. MR microangiography measurements were made during air, oxygen, and carbogen inhalation. From three-dimensional MR microangiography, the retina was virtually flattened to enable en face views of various retinal depths, including the retinal and choroidal vascular layers. Signal intensity changes within the retinal or choroidal arteries and veins associated with gas challenges were analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed by using paired t tests, with P<.05 considered to indicate a significant difference. Bonferroni correction was used to adjust for multiple comparisons.The central retinal artery, long posterior ciliary arteries, and choroidal vasculature could be distinguished on MR microangiograms of the eye. With MR microangiography, retinal arteries and veins could be distinguished on the basis of blood oxygen level-dependent contrast. Carbogen inhalation-enhanced MR microangiography signal intensity in both the retina (P=.001) and choroid (P=.027) compared with oxygen inhalation. Carbogen inhalation showed significantly higher signal intensity changes in the retinal arteries (P=.001, compared with oxygen inhalation), but not in the veins (P=.549). With MION administration, MR microangiography depicted retinal arterial vasoconstriction when the animals were breathing oxygen (P=.02, compared with animals breathing air).MR microangiography of the eye allows depth-resolved imaging of small angiographic details of the ocular circulation. This approach may prove useful in studying microvascular pathologic findings and neurovascular dysfunction in the eye and retina.",
        "To evaluate the performance of computed tomographic (CT) examinations at 80 and 100 kV with tube current-time products of 75-150 mA and the effect of adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) on CT image quality in patients with urinary stone disease.In this HIPAA-compliant institutional review board-approved study, verbal consent for prospective low-dose CT and waivers of consent for retrospective review of CT scans were obtained. Between November 2010 and April 2011, 25 patients (15 men, 10 women; mean age, 35 years) with urolithiasis underwent 64-section multidetector CT with 75-150 mA and noise index of 30. Modified protocol was based on body weight (<200 lb [90 kg], 80 kV; >200 lb [90 kg], 100 kV). Images of 5-mm section thickness were reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP) and 60% and 80% ASIR techniques, with 3-mm coronal and sagittal reformations. Two readers independently reviewed FBP and ASIR data sets for image quality (scale, 1-5), noise (scale , 1-3), and calculi (number, size, location). Confidence levels for urolithiaisis and alternate diagnoses were rated (scale, 1-3). In 13 patients, FBP CT images acquired with the reference standard departmental protocol were available for comparison. Radiation dose was compared between imaging series. Statistical analysis was performed with Wilcoxon signed rank and paired t tests.Modified-protocol FBP images showed low image quality (score, 2.5), with improvement on modified-protocol ASIR images (score, 3.4) (P=.03). All 33 stones (mean diameter, 6.1 mm; range, 2-28 mm) at modified-protocol CT were diagnosed by both readers. In 20 of 25 patients (80%), ASIR images were rated adequate for rendering other diagnoses in the abdomen (score, 2.0), as opposed to FBP images (score, 1.3). Mean radiation dose for modified-protocol CT was 1.8 mGy (1.3 mGy for patients<200 lb; 2.3 mGy for patients>200 lb) in comparison with 9.9 mGy for reference-protocol CT (P=.001).Image quality improvements with ASIR at reduced radiation dose of 1.8 mGy enabled effective evaluation of urinary calculi without substantially affecting diagnostic confidence. \u00a9 RSNA, 2012.",
        "To prospectively investigate the incremental value of multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging compared with standard T2-weighted imaging for biopsy planning.The study was approved by the institutional review board; informed consent was obtained. Consecutive patients underwent T2-weighted imaging supplemented with multiparametric 1.5-T MR imaging, consisting of hydrogen 1 ((1)H) MR spectroscopy, diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging, and contrast material-enhanced MR imaging. Quantitative parameters were calculated: (choline plus creatine)-to-citrate ratio, apparent diffusion coefficient, and volume transfer constant and exchange rate constant. The prostate was divided into 20 standardized areas. Each area was classified as benign, inconclusive, or suspicious at T2-weighted imaging, followed by quantitative evaluation of all inconclusive and suspicious areas with multiparametric MR imaging. MR-guided biopsy was performed in lesions classified as suspicious for cancer with at least one of the techniques after transfer to three-dimensional T2-weighted images. Diagnostic parameters were calculated on a per-lesion and per-patient basis for all combinations of T2-weighted imaging with multiparametric MR imaging.Fifty-four patients had a median of two prior transrectal ultrasonographic biopsies with negative findings. Each patient had a median of three suspicious lesions. Prostate cancer was demonstrated in 21 of 54 patients. Biopsy was performed in 178 lesions; 53 were positive for prostate cancer. Detection rates and test negative results, respectively, were as follows: T2-weighted imaging, 70% and 50%; T2-weighted imaging and (1)H MR spectroscopy, 81% and 32%; T2-weighted imaging and contrast-enhanced MR imaging, 83% and 29%; T2-weighted imaging and DW imaging, 85% and 30%; T2-weighted imaging, (1)H MR spectroscopy, and contrast-enhanced MR imaging, 91% and 13%; T2-weighted imaging, (1)H MR spectroscopy, and DW imaging, 94% and 15%; T2-weighted imaging, DW imaging, and contrast-enhanced MR imaging, 94% and 13%; T2-weighted imaging, (1)H MR spectroscopy, DW imaging, and contrast-enhanced MR imaging, 100% and 0%.Only the combination of T2-weighted imaging with all three multiparametric techniques depicts all identifiable prostate cancers; a double combination with DW imaging and (1)H MR spectroscopy or contrast-enhanced MR imaging misses 6%, while reasonably reducing the number of areas needing biopsy.",
        "Purpose To compare the capability to aid prediction of clinical outcome measures, including progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), between volumetric estimates from contrast material\u2013enhanced (CE) T1-weighted subtraction maps and traditional segmentation in a randomized multicenter clinical trial of recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) patients treated with bevacizumab. Materials and Methods All patients participating in this study signed institutional review board\u2013approved informed consent at their respective institutions prior to enrolling in the multicenter clinical trial. One-hundred sixty patients with recurrent GBM enrolled as part of a HIPAA-compliant, multicenter clinical trial (AVF3708 g, BRAIN trial). Contrast-enhancing tumor volumes and change in volumes as a response to therapy were quantified by using either conventional segmentation or CE T1-weighted subtraction maps created by voxel-by-voxel subtraction of intensity-normalized nonenhanced T1-weighted images from CE T1-weighted images. These volumes were then tested as predictors of PFS and OS by using log-rank univariate analysis, the multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model, and receiver operating characteristic analysis. Results Use of CE T1-weighted subtraction maps qualitatively improved visualization and improved quantification of tumor volume after bevacizumab treatment. Significant trends between the volume of tumor and change in tumor volume after therapy on CE T1-weighted subtraction maps were found for both PFS and OS (pretreatment volume < 15 cm3, P < .003; posttreatment volume < 7.5 cm3, P < .05; percentage change in volume > 25%, P = .004 for PFS and P = .053 for OS). CE T1-weighted subtraction maps were significantly better at aiding prediction of 6-month PFS and 12-month OS compared with conventional segmentation by using receiver operating characteristic analysis (P < .05). Conclusion Use of CE T1-weighted subtraction maps improved visualization and aided better prediction of patient survival in recurrent GBM treated with bevacizumab compared with conventional segmentation of CE T1-weighted images. \u00a9RSNA, 2013 Clinical trial registration no.

        "Purpose To investigate whether the blood-brain barrier (BBB) leaks blood-circulating substances in patients with early forms of Alzheimer disease (AD), and if so, to examine the extent and pattern of leakage. Materials and Methods This study was approved by the local medical ethical committees of the Maastricht University Medical Center and Leiden University Medical Center, and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. For this pilot study, 16 patients with early AD and 17 healthy age-matched control subjects underwent dynamic contrast material-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging sequence with dual time resolution for 25 minutes. The Patlak graphical approach was used to quantify the BBB leakage rate and local blood plasma volume. Subsequent histogram analysis was used to determine the volume fraction of the leaking brain tissue. Differences were assessed with linear regression analysis, adjusted for confounding variables. Results The BBB leakage rate was significantly higher in patients compared with that in control subjects in the total gray matter (P < .05) and cortex (P = .03). Patients had a significantly higher volume fraction of the leaking brain tissue in the gray matter (P = .004), normal-appearing white matter (P < .04), deep gray matter (P = .01), and cortex (P = .004). When all subjects were considered, scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination decreased significantly with increasing leakage in the deep gray matter (P = .007) and cortex (P < .05). Conclusion The results of this study showed global BBB leakage in patients with early AD that is associated with cognitive decline. A compromised BBB may be part of a cascade of pathologic events that eventually lead to cognitive decline and dementia. \u00a9RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "To test the hypothesis that in patients with unilateral patellofemoral instability ( PI patellofemoral instability ), the contralateral asymptomatic joints have abnormal morphology and imaging features of osteoarthritis ( OA osteoarthritis ) at four-dimensional ( 4D four-dimensional ) computed tomography (CT).The institutional review board approved this HIPAA-compliant retrospective study. Informed consent was waived. Radiology records were reviewed to identify 25 patients (male-female ratio, 0.56; median age, 20 years; range, 13-43 years) with unilateral PI patellofemoral instability undergoing 4D four-dimensional CT and 25 age- and sex-matched control patients undergoing multidetector CT. Trochlear groove depth ( TGD trochlear groove depth ), tibial tuberosity-trochlear groove ( TT-TG tibial tuberosity-trochlear groove ) distance, and patellar height ratio ( PHR patellar height ratio ) were determined to compare morphology, and bisect offset ( BO bisect offset ) measurements were obtained to compare lateral displacement of the patella between the two groups by using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. All images were interpreted by trained observers. Tracking patterns of the patellae were determined by obtaining BO bisect offset measurements at various flexion angles with 4D four-dimensional CT.In the contralateral asymptomatic joints, TGD trochlear groove depth (median, 3.0 mm; 95% confidence interval [ CI confidence interval ]: 2.5, 4.6; P < .0001), TT-TG tibial tuberosity-trochlear groove (median, 15 mm; 95% CI confidence interval : 12.7, 18; P = .008), PHR patellar height ratio (median, 1.17; 95% CI confidence interval : 1.09, 1.2; P = .002), and patellar lateral displacement ( BO bisect offset , 85%; 95% CI confidence interval : 76.2%, 98.2%; P < .0001) were different from measurements obtained in the control group: TGD trochlear groove depth median, 5.0 mm (95% CI confidence interval : 2.2, 7.6); TT-TG tibial tuberosity-trochlear groove median, 10.9 mm (95% CI confidence interval : 3.4, 20.7); PHR patellar height ratio median, 0.92 (95% CI confidence interval : 0.67, 1.36); and BO bisect offset median, 63% (95% CI confidence interval : 59%, 68.4%). OA osteoarthritis was detected in 40% of asymmetrical contralateral joints (10 of 25). By using 4D four-dimensional CT data, multiple regression analysis demonstrated that TGD trochlear groove depth (P = .026) and BO bisect offset measurements obtained at 30\u00b0 of knee flexion (P = .047) had an association with the presence of OA osteoarthritis .Abnormal morphology and imaging features of OA osteoarthritis are relatively common in contralateral asymptomatic joints of young patients with unilateral PI patellofemoral instability .",
        "Introduction: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive disorder causing red blood cell sickling, vasooclusion and haemolysis. Doppler ultrasonography of the renal vessels provides a non-invasive method of investigating renal diseases which includes sickle cell nephropathy.\r\nAims and objective: To compare the renal dimensions and renal artery resistive index (RI) in children with sickle cell disease with those of healthy children.\r\nMethodology: This prospective study was conducted from May, 2013 to December, 2013.\r\n50 patients with SCD and 50 apparently healthy children matched for age were recruited for this study. Ultrasound assessment of the kidney including the renal dimension and Doppler scan of the interlobar artery of the kidneys was performed.\r\nResults: The mean renal length (RL) in children with SCD is 8.5\u00b11.29 cm on the right side (RT) and 8.5\u00b11.34 cm on the left side (LT). The mean RL in the control is 7.8\u00b11.2 cm on the RT and 8.0\u00b11.26 cm on the LT. The cortical thickness (CT) in children with SCD is 1.0\u00b10.24cm on the RT and 1.1\u00b10.20cm on the LT. The CT in the control is 0.9\u00b10.24cm on the RT and 0.9\u00b10.28cm on the LT. The RI in children with SCD is 0.7\u00b10.06 on the RT and 0.8\u00b10.05 on the LT. The RI in the control group is 0.6\u00b10.05 on RT and 0.6\u00b10.06 on the LT. The PSV is children with SCD is 77.5\u00b122.3 on the RT and 83.0\u00b120.53 on the LT. The PSV in the control group is 67.2\u00b118.78 on the RT and 74.4\u00b119.58 on the LT.

        "Purpose To evaluate three coronary artery calcification (CAC) scoring methods to assess risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) death and all-cause mortality in National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) participants across levels of CAC scores. Materials and Methods The NLST was approved by the institutional review board at each participating institution, and informed consent was obtained from all participants. Image review was HIPAA compliant. Five cardiothoracic radiologists evaluated 1575 low-dose computed tomographic (CT) scans from three groups: 210 CHD deaths, 315 deaths not from CHD, and 1050 participants who were alive at conclusion of the trial. Radiologists used three scoring methods: overall visual assessment, segmented vessel-specific scoring, and Agatston scoring. Weighted Cox proportional hazards models were fit to evaluate the association between scoring methods and outcomes. Results In multivariate analysis of time to CHD death, Agatston scores of 1\u2013100, 101\u20131000, and greater than 1000 (reference category 0) were associated with hazard ratios of 1.27 (95% confidence interval: 0.69, 2.53), 3.57 (95% confidence interval: 2.14, 7.48), and 6.63 (95% confidence interval: 3.57, 14.97), respectively; hazard ratios for summed segmented vessel-specific scores of 1\u20135, 6\u201311, and 12\u201330 (reference category 0) were 1.72 (95% confidence interval: 1.05, 3.34), 5.11 (95% confidence interval: 2.92, 10.94), and 6.10 (95% confidence interval: 3.19, 14.05), respectively; and hazard ratios for overall visual assessment of mild, moderate, or heavy (reference category none) were 2.09 (95% confidence interval: 1.30, 4.16), 3.86 (95% confidence interval: 2.02, 8.20), and 6.95 (95% confidence interval: 3.73, 15.67), respectively. Conclusion By using low-dose CT performed for lung cancer screening in older, heavy smokers, a simple visual assessment of CAC can be generated for risk assessment of CHD death and all-cause mortality, which is comparable to Agatston scoring and strongly associated with outcome. \u00a9 RSNA, 2015 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "History Part one of this case appeared 4 months previously and may contain larger images. A 40-year-old woman presented to the outpatient department of our hospital with a 2-year history of abdominal pain, which had worsened in the past few days. There were no other constitutional symptoms; in particular, there was no weight loss or loss of appetite. The serum amylase and serum lipase levels were always within normal limits, even during the current episode. There was no history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, drug use, or trauma. The patient was evaluated at an outside clinic 2 years ago and underwent imaging, including US and dedicated pancreatic CT, which revealed a complex multiseptated noncalcified pancreatic cystic lesion. After CT, the patient underwent endoscopic US, which showed the lesion was suspected to be an infected parasitic cyst; fine-needle aspiration and cytology were not attempted due to the risk of iatrogenic rupture. The patient was advised to undergo surgical resection but declined the procedure and was lost to follow-up for 2 years before her current visit to our facility. On clinical examination, there were no clinically important findings, aside from mild to moderate pain on deep palpation and some shifting dullness that was suggestive of ascites. The patient always remained hemodynamically stable. US-guided ascitic fluid analysis was performed, which revealed amylase levels of 869 IU/L (normal range, 4\u2013234 IU/L). Considering prior CT and endoscopic US reports, the patient was further evaluated with a pancreatic MRI protocol for lesion characterization and to explain the new-onset abdominal pain.",
        "Purpose To compare the clinical impact of combined positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to that of combined PET and computed tomography (CT) performed on the same day in patients with cancer. Materials and Methods This HIPAA-compliant retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board. Patients gave written informed consent for study enrollment, including the possibility to use their imaging and clinical data in future evaluations. A total of 134 patients with cancer with a non\u2013central nervous system primary neoplasm underwent same-day fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT and FDG PET/MR imaging. PET/CT and PET/MR studies were independently interpreted by teams of radiologists and nuclear medicine physicians. Four readers, divided into two teams composed of one radiologist and one nuclear medicine physician each, read all 134 studies. The referring physician classified discordance between PET/CT and PET/MR observations either as findings affecting clinical management or as findings not affecting clinical management. Data were compared with the \u03c72 test. Results Findings affecting clinical management were noted for PET/CT studies but not for PET/MR studies in two (1.5%) of 134 patients and for PET/MR studies but not for PET/CT studies in 24 (17.9%) of 134 patients. The discrepancies between findings affecting clinical management detected with PET/MR imaging over those detected with PET/CT were significant (P < .001). Conclusion In these patients, PET/MR imaging alone contributed to clinical management more often than did PET/CT alone. PET/MR imaging provides information that affects the care of patients with cancer and is unavailable from PET/CT. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To investigate associations between computed tomographic (CT) features of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and mutations in VHL, PBRM1, SETD2, KDM5C, or BAP1 genes. Materials and Methods The institutional review board approved this retrospective, hypothesis-generating study of 233 patients with clear cell RCC and waived the informed consent requirement. The study was HIPAA compliant. Three radiologists independently reviewed pretreatment CT images of all clear cell RCCs without knowledge of their genomic profile. One radiologist measured largest diameter and enhancement parameters of each clear cell RCC. Associations between CT features and mutations in VHL, PBRM1, SETD2, KDM5C, and BAP1 genes were tested by using the Fisher exact test. Associations between mutations and size and enhancement were assessed by using the independent t test. Interreader agreement was calculated by using the Fleiss \u03ba. Results Mutation frequencies among clear cell RCCs were as follows: VHL, 53.2% (124 of 233); PBRM1, 28.8% (67 of 233); SETD2, 7.3% (17 of 233); KDM5C, 6.9% (16 of 233); and BAP1, 6.0% (14 of 233). Mutations of VHL were significantly associated with well-defined tumor margins (P = .013), nodular tumor enhancement (P = .021), and gross appearance of intratumoral vascularity (P = .018). Mutations of KDM5C and BAP1 were significantly associated with evidence of renal vein invasion (P = .022 and .046, respectively). The genotype of solid clear cell RCC differed significantly from the genotype of multicystic clear cell RCC. While mutations of SETD2, KDM5C, and BAP1 were absent in multicystic clear cell RCC, mutations of VHL (P = .016) and PBRM1 (P = .017) were significantly more common among solid clear cell RCC. Interreader agreement for CT feature assessments ranged from substantial to excellent (\u03ba = 0.791\u20130.912). Conclusion This preliminary radiogenomics analysis of clear cell RCC revealed associations between CT features and underlying mutations that warrant further investigation and validation. \u00a9RSNA, 2013 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "History A 6-year-old male child, born at full term via vaginal delivery, presented with a history of ataxia and delayed motor development.

        "Background The Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System (O-RADS) US risk stratification and management system (O-RADS US) was designed to improve risk assessment and management of ovarian and adnexal lesions. Validation studies including both surgical and nonsurgical treatment as the reference standard remain lacking. Purpose To externally validate O-RADS US in women who underwent either surgical or nonsurgical treatment and to determine if incorporating acoustic shadowing as a benign finding improves diagnostic performance. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included consecutive women who underwent pelvic US between August 2015 and April 2017 at a tertiary referral oncology center. Two independent readers blinded to clinical and histologic outcome assigned an O-RADS risk category and an International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) Assessment of Different NEoplasias in the adneXa (ADNEX) model risk of malignancy score to assessable lesions. Reference standards were surgical histopathology or 2-year imaging follow-up. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate performance of the O-RADS US, ADNEX, and modified O-RADS models incorporating acoustic shadowing. Results In total, 227 women (mean age, 52 years \u00b1 16 [SD]) with 262 ovarian or adnexal lesions were evaluated. Of these lesions, 187 (71%) were benign and 75 (29%) were malignant. The proportion of malignancy was 0% (0 of 100) for O-RADS 2, 3% (one of 32) for O-RADS 3, 35% (22 of 63) for O-RADS 4, and 78% (52 of 67) for O-RADS 5. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for O-RADS and ADNEX was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.88, 0.94) and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.92, 0.97; P = .01), respectively. The addition of acoustic shadowing as a benign finding improved O-RADS AUC to 0.94 (95% CI: 0.91, 0.96; P = .01). Use of O-RADS 4 as a threshold yielded a sensitivity of 99% (74 of 75; 95% CI: 96, 100) and a specificity of 70% (131 of 187; 95% CI: 64, 77). Conclusion In a tertiary referral oncology center, the Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System US risk stratification and management system enabled accurate distinction of benign from malignant ovarian and adnexal lesions. Adding acoustic shadowing as a benign finding improved its diagnostic performance. \u00a9 RSNA, 2022 See also the editorial by Levine in this issue.",
        "History A 50-year-old woman presented with a 6-month history of polyarthralgia involving the left and right hands, wrists, elbows, ankles, and knees. Her pain was not associated with morning stiffness but did worsen over the course of the day. She denied experiencing fevers, chills, or mouth ulcers. She did not report paresthesias or blue discoloration of her fingers when they were exposed to cold. Her family history was remarkable for an aunt who died of systemic lupus erythematosus and for a brother with arthritis. Her medical history was remarkable for vitamin D deficiency, hypertension, and rehabilitation for burns. At clinical examination, she had mild tenderness to palpation of her joints, without associated erythema, swelling, or crepitus. Healed skin grafts were also noted. Blood chemistry tests revealed a rheumatoid factor of 8.5 IU/mL (normal range, 0\u201313.9 IU/mL), an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 2 mm/hr (normal range, 0\u201340 mm/hr), and a C-reactive protein value of 0.4 mg/L (3.8 nmol/L) (normal range, 0\u20134.9 mg/L [0\u201346.7 nmol/L]). Antinuclear antibodies test results were negative. Radiography of the right and left hands was performed.",
        "Purpose To test the hypothesis that hepatic triglyceride content is associated with subclinical vascular impairment and is not confounded by various cardiometabolic risk factors. Materials and Methods This study was approved by the institutional review board, and all participants gave written informed consent. In this cross-sectional analysis of baseline measurements of the Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity study, a population-based cohort study, 1899 participants (52% men; mean age, 55 years \u00b1 6 [standard deviation]) underwent magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy and MR imaging to assess hepatic triglyceride content, aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV), and visceral fat. Carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) was acquired and measured by trained research nurses according to standard procedures. Multivariate regression analyses were used to study associations of hepatic triglyceride content with total and regional aortic PWV and carotid IMT while adjusting for several possible confounding factors, including the metabolic syndrome. Results Total aortic PWV (mean difference, 0.5 m/sec; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.3, 0.7) and carotid IMT (mean difference, 37 \u03bcm; 95% CI: 25, 49) were higher in participants with hepatic steatosis. After adjusting for various covariates, a 10-fold increase in hepatic triglyceride content was associated with an increased mean aortic PWV of 0.19 m/sec (95% CI: 0.03, 0.36) in total and an increased mean aortic PWV of 0.42 m/sec (95% CI: 0.03, 0.81) in the abdominal segment. A 10-fold increase in hepatic triglyceride content was also associated with an increased mean carotid IMT of 15 \u03bcm (95% CI: 0, 29) but not after additional adjustments for visceral and total body fat. Conclusion In this relatively large population-based cohort study, hepatic triglyceride content was associated with aortic pulse wave velocity and carotid IMT. These associations were only partly explained by the metabolic syndrome and visceral adiposity, suggesting a possible specific contribution of hepatic steatosis to subclinical vascular impairment. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To compare biparametric contrast-free radiomic machine learning (RML), mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and radiologist assessment for characterization of prostate lesions detected during prospective MRI interpretation. Materials and Methods This single-institution study included 316 men (mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 64.0 years \u00b1 7.8) with an indication for MRI-transrectal US fusion biopsy between May 2015 and September 2016 (training cohort, 183 patients; test cohort, 133 patients). Lesions identified by prospective clinical readings were manually segmented for mean ADC and radiomics analysis. Global and zone-specific random forest RML and mean ADC models for classification of clinically significant prostate cancer (Gleason grade group \u2265 2) were developed on the training set and the fixed models tested on an independent test set. Clinical readings, mean ADC, and radiomics were compared by using the McNemar test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results In the test set, radiologist interpretation had a per-lesion sensitivity of 88% (53 of 60) and specificity of 50% (79 of 159). Quantitative measurement of the mean ADC (cut-off 732 mm2/sec) significantly reduced false-positive (FP) lesions from 80 to 60 (specificity 62% [99 of 159]) and false-negative (FN) lesions from seven to six (sensitivity 90% [54 of 60]) (P = .048). Radiologist interpretation had a per-patient sensitivity of 89% (40 of 45) and specificity of 43% (38 of 88). Quantitative measurement of the mean ADC reduced the number of patients with FP lesions from 50 to 43 (specificity 51% [45 of 88]) and the number of patients with FN lesions from five to three (sensitivity 93% [42 of 45]) (P = .496). Comparison of the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the mean ADC (AUCglobal = 0.84; AUCzone-specific \u2264 0.87) vs the RML (AUCglobal = 0.88, P = .176; AUCzone-specific \u2264 0.89, P \u2265 .493) showed no significantly different performance. Conclusion Quantitative measurement of the mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) improved differentiation of benign versus malignant prostate lesions, compared with clinical assessment. Radiomic machine learning had comparable but not better performance than mean ADC assessment. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To assess the feasibility and accuracy of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT)\u2013guided needle localization for DBT-detected suspicious abnormalities not visualized with other modalities and to analyze the imaging and pathologic characteristics of abnormalities detected only with DBT to determine the positive predictive value for malignancy. Materials and Methods This HIPAA-compliant study was approved by the institutional review board, and the requirement to obtain informed consent was waived. A retrospective query of the imaging database identified 34 consecutive women (average age, 55 years; age range, 28\u201384 years) with 36 lesions who underwent DBT-guided needle localization between April 2011 and January 2013 with use of commercially available equipment. Imaging findings and medical records were reviewed. Findings that were attributable to previous surgical changes were classified as benign or probably benign and excluded from analysis because the lesions did not proceed to localization. Results Architectural distortion was the imaging finding identified in all 36 abnormalities (100%). Findings from pathologic examination after the first attempt at localization were concordant with those from imaging in 35 of the 36 lesions (97%), which is suggestive of appropriate sampling. Histologic findings were malignant in 17 of the 36 lesions (47%; 95% confidence interval: 30.4%, 64.5%). Thirteen of the 17 lesions (76%; 95% confidence interval: 50.1%, 93.1%) were invasive malignancies. Twenty-two of the 36 abnormalities (61%) were either malignant or high-risk lesions (atypical ductal hyperplasia, lobular carcinoma in situ, atypical lobular hyperplasia). Conclusion DBT-guided needle localization is an accurate and feasible method with which to biopsy DBT-detected suspicious architectural distortions not visualized at mammography or sonography. The high risk of malignancy in abnormalities detected only with DBT (47%) confirms that routine biopsy is required for histologic analysis. \u00a9 RSNA, 2015 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To evaluate the accuracy of trabecular analysis of the lumbar spine by using multidetector computed tomography (CT) in differentiating multiple myeloma patients without spinal fractures from control subjects. Materials and Methods This retrospective single-institution study was approved by the institutional review board, with a waiver of informed consent. Spinal microarchitecture was examined by using 64\u2013detector row CT in 29 patients with multiple myeloma and 51 control subjects. The patients were 13 men and 16 women (mean ages, 71.1 and 69.2 years, respectively). By using multidetector CT data, eight parameters were calculated for the L3 vertebral trabeculae with a three-dimensional image analysis system. The \u03c72 test was used to select a preliminary set of predictors for multiple myeloma. A multivariable generalized linear model was constructed to identify parameters that could be used to differentiate between patients and controls. Parameters with findings of P < .05 were included in the multivariable model. Results Generalized linear models showed that mean trabecular thickness (TbTh) (patients, 703.7 \u03bcm \u00b1 46.7 [standard deviation]; controls, 661.1 \u03bcm \u00b1 35.7) and fractal dimension (FD) (patients, 2.23 \u00b1 0.24; controls, 2.41 \u00b1 0.15) in men (P = .05 and .03, respectively) and degree of anisotropy (DA) (patients, 1.63 \u00b1 0.23; controls, 1.38 \u00b1 0.10) in women (P = .02) had significant effects in differentiation between patients and controls. Conclusion Significant differences were observed in spinal microarchitecture between control subjects and multiple myeloma patients without pathologic fractures. Independent predictors of multiple myeloma included TbTh and FD in male patients and DA in female patients. \u00a9 RSNA, 2011",
        "History A 54-year-old man was found by paramedics in his home face-down at his computer desk with a substantially reduced level of consciousness. He had not contacted his family for more than 50 hours. The patient lived alone and was a heavy smoker with a history of alcohol abuse. His medical history was otherwise unremarkable, and there was no history of cancer, psoriasis, or rheumatoid arthritis, nor was there a history of methotrexate administration. On presentation to the emergency department, he was mildly hypotensive and was experiencing hypercapnic respiratory failure and acute renal failure with rhabdomyolysis. His toxicology screen was mildly positive for opiates. He received naloxone (Narcan; Emergent) with minimal effect. An unenhanced CT scan of the head was obtained (Fig 1A). Of note, this patient's presentation predated the COVID-19 pandemic. He was admitted to the intensive care unit for decreased level of consciousness and respiratory failure. The decreased level of consciousness was thought to be secondary to seizure, as he developed seizurelike movements prior to intubation, probably in the context of intoxication or alcohol withdrawal. Electroencephalography revealed moderate bilateral cerebral dysfunction and encephalopathy, with no evidence of nonconvulsive seizures. He had a short course of intermittent hemodialysis and was discharged home 8 days later with an appointment for neurology follow-up. At discharge, he was at his cognitive and functional baseline. Approximately 3 weeks later, the patient was brought back to the emergency department for progressive confusion and decrease in balance. He became apathetic with reduced psychomotor activity and was no longer able to perform basic daily activities, such as cooking or bathing. He displayed bizarre behavior, such as staring at a wall for hours, and was somnolent, irritable, and inattentive. He eventually became incontinent of urine and stool. Results of a neurologic examination of the cranial nerves, motor function, sensation, and reflexes were normal. The results of blood work-up were grossly normal, and the results of an extensive toxicology work-up were negative. Repeat head CT was performed (Fig 1B). MRI was ordered to further investigate the patient's encephalopathic presentation (Figs 2-3).",
        "Purpose To compare the classification of breast density with two automated methods, Volpara (version 1.5.0; Matakina Technology, Wellington, New Zealand) and Quantra (version 2.0; Hologic, Bedford, Mass), with clinical Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) density classifications and to examine associations of these measures with breast cancer risk. Materials and Methods In this study, 1911 patients with breast cancer and 4170 control subjects matched for age, race, examination date, and mammography machine were evaluated. Participants underwent mammography at Mayo Clinic or one of four sites within the San Francisco Mammography Registry between 2006 and 2012 and provided informed consent or a waiver for research, in compliance with HIPAA regulations and institutional review board approval. Digital mammograms were retrieved a mean of 2.1 years (range, 6 months to 6 years) before cancer diagnosis, with the corresponding clinical BI-RADS density classifications, and Volpara and Quantra density estimates were generated. Agreement was assessed with weighted \u03ba statistics among control subjects. Breast cancer associations were evaluated with conditional logistic regression, adjusted for age and body mass index. Odds ratios, C statistics, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. Results Agreement between clinical BI-RADS density classifications and Volpara and Quantra BI-RADS estimates was moderate, with \u03ba values of 0.57 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.59) and 0.46 (95% CI: 0.44, 0.47), respectively. Differences of up to 14% in dense tissue classification were found, with Volpara classifying 51% of women as having dense breasts, Quantra classifying 37%, and clinical BI-RADS assessment used to classify 43%. Clinical and automated measures showed similar breast cancer associations; odds ratios for extremely dense breasts versus scattered fibroglandular densities were 1.8 (95% CI: 1.5, 2.2), 1.9 (95% CI: 1.5, 2.5), and 2.3 (95% CI: 1.9, 2.8) for Volpara, Quantra, and BI-RADS classifications, respectively. Clinical BI-RADS assessment showed better discrimination of case status (C = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.58, 0.61) than did Volpara (C = 0.58; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.59) and Quantra (C = 0.56; 95% CI: 0.54, 0.58) BI-RADS classifications. Conclusion Automated and clinical assessments of breast density are similarly associated with breast cancer risk but differ up to 14% in the classification of women with dense breasts. This could have substantial effects on clinical practice patterns. (\u00a9) RSNA, 2015 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Substantial societal investments in biomedical research are contributing to an explosion in knowledge that the health delivery system is struggling to effectively implement.

        "Purpose To evaluate the clinical performance of dual-agent relaxation contrast (DARC) magnetic resonance (MR) lymphangiography compared with that of conventional MR lymphangiography in the creation of isolated lymphatic maps in patients with secondary lymphedema. Materials and Methods This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board. The diagnostic quality of 42 DARC MR lymphangiographic studies was compared with that of 42 conventional MR lymphangiographic studies. Two independent readers rated venous contamination as absent, mild, or moderate to severe. Interreader agreement on venous contamination grades was assessed by using the linearly weighted Cohen \u03ba statistic. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the distribution of grades at each station between conventional MR lymphangiography and DARC MR lymphangiography for each reader separately. Results DARC MR lymphangiography had significantly less venous contamination than did conventional MR lymphangiography (P < .001). The two radiologists rated venous contamination as moderate to severe in 64% (27 of 42) and 69% (29 of 42) of distal limbs, 23% (10 of 42) of midlimbs, and 2% (one of 42) and 9% (four of 42) of proximal limbs at conventional MR lymphangiography compared with 0% (0 of 42) of distal limbs, 2% (one of 42) of midlimbs, and 0% (0 of 42) of proximal limbs at DARC MR lymphangiography. Lymphatic signal was partially attenuated (median 45% decrease) when longer echo times were used for venous suppression, but it did not subjectively degrade diagnostic quality. Conclusion DARC MR lymphangiography yields isolated lymphatic maps through nulling of venous contamination, thereby simplifying diagnostic interpretation and communication with surgical colleagues. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017.",
        "To prospectively evaluate radiation and contrast medium requirements for performing high-pitch coronary computed tomographic (CT) angiography at 70 kV using a third-generation dual-source CT system in comparison to a second-generation dual-source CT system.All patients gave informed consent for this institutional review board-approved study. Forty-five patients (median age, 52 years; 27 men) were imaged in high-pitch mode with a third-generation dual-source CT system at 70 kV (n = 15) or with a second-generation dual-source CT system at 80 or 100 kV (n = 15 for each). Tube voltage was based on body mass index: 80 or 70 kV for less than 26 kg/m(2) versus 100 kV for 26-30 kg/m(2). For the 80- and 100-kV protocols, 80 mL of contrast material was injected, versus 45 mL for the 70-kV protocol. Data were reconstructed by using a second-generation iterative reconstruction algorithm for second-generation dual-source CT and a recently introduced third-generation iterative reconstruction algorithm for third-generation dual-source CT. Objective image quality was measured for various regions of interest, and subjective image quality was evaluated with a five-point Likert scale.The signal-to-noise ratio of the coronary CT angiography studies acquired with 70 kV was significantly higher (70 kV: 14.3-17.6 vs 80 kV: 7.1-12.9 vs 100 kV: 9.8-12.9; P < .0497) than those acquired with the other two protocols for all coronary arteries. Qualitative image quality analyses revealed no significant differences between the three CT angiography protocols (median score, 5; P > .05). The mean effective dose was 75% and 108% higher (0.92 mSv \u00b1 0.3 [standard deviation] and 0.78 mSv \u00b1 0.2 vs 0.44 mSv \u00b1 0.1; P < .0001), respectively, for the 80- and 100-kV CT angiography protocols than for the 70-kV CT angiography protocol.In nonobese patients, third-generation high-pitch coronary dual-source CT angiography at 70 kV results in robust image quality for studying the coronary arteries, at significantly reduced radiation dose (0.44 mSv) and contrast medium volume (45 mL), thus enabling substantial radiation dose and contrast medium savings as compared with second-generation dual-source CT.",
        "Purpose To evaluate a radiomics model for predicting lymph node (LN) metastasis in biliary tract cancers (BTCs) and to determine its prognostic value for disease-specific and recurrence-free survival. Materials and Methods For this retrospective study, a radiomics model was developed on the basis of a primary cohort of 177 patients with BTC who underwent resection and LN dissection between June 2010 and December 2016. Radiomic features were extracted from portal venous CT scans. A radiomics signature was built on the basis of reproducible features by using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method. Multivariable logistic regression model was adopted to establish a radiomics nomogram. Nomogram performance was determined by its discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness. The model was internally validated in 70 consecutive patients with BTC between January 2017 and February 2018. Results The radiomics signature, composed of three LN-status\u2013related features, was associated with LN metastasis in primary and validation cohorts (P < .001). The radiomics nomogram that incorporated radiomics signature and CT-reported LN status showed good calibration and discrimination in primary cohort (area under the curve, 0.81) and validation cohort (area under the curve, 0.80). Patients at high risk of LN metastasis portended lower disease-specific and recurrence-free survival than did those at low risk after surgery (both P < .001). High-risk LN metastasis was an independent preoperative predictor of disease-specific survival (hazard ratio, 3.37; P < .001) and recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio, 1.98; P = .003). Conclusion A radiomics model derived from portal phase CT of the liver has good performance for predicting lymph node metastasis in biliary tract cancer and may help to improve clinical decision making. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Purpose To retrospectively investigate whether the background parenchymal features around a tumor at preoperative dynamic contrast material\u2013enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging are associated with ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR)\u2013free survival in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) after breast conservation surgery. Materials and Methods The institutional review board approved this study, and the requirement for informed consent was waived. Between 2004 and 2009, 215 consecutive women with pure DCIS who had undergone preoperative dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging and curative breast conservation surgery were identified. Clinical-pathologic features (age, menopausal status, presentation of clinical findings, biopsy method, tumor size, nuclear grade, hormonal receptor status, margin status, and adjuvant therapy) and MR imaging features (lesion size, background parenchymal enhancement grade, fibroglandular density, parenchymal signal enhancement ratio [SER] around the tumor, lesion type, and lesion kinetics) were analyzed. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine the association between MR imaging variables and IBTR-free survival after controlling for clinical-pathologic variables. Reproducibility of SER measurements was evaluated by using the intraclass correlation coefficient. Results There were 15 of 215 (7.0%) IBTR cases (nine DCIS cases and six invasive cases) at a median of 36 months (range, 11\u201361 months). Multivariate analysis showed that higher parenchymal SER (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.028, P < .001 for reader 1; HR = 1.652, P < .001 for reader 2) and larger histologic tumor size (HR = 1.360, P = .009 for reader 1; HR = 1.402, P = .006 for reader 2) were independent factors associated with worse IBTR-free survival. The intraclass correlation coefficient of SER measurements between two readers was 0.852 (95% confidence interval: 0.811, 0.885). Conclusion Higher parenchymal SER around the tumor at preoperative dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging and larger histologic tumor size were independent factors associated with worse IBTR-free survival in patients with DCIS after breast conservation surgery. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013",
        "History A 92-year-old bedridden woman presented to the emergency department from an assisted living facility with fever, cough, and swelling over the right lateral hip. She had baseline dementia and frailty and had been bedridden for 4 years. She did not have any recent falls or history of trauma at the site of swelling. She had a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that had been diagnosed and treated 7 years ago, and thoracoabdominal CT at last follow-up 3 years ago did not show any recurrence. Physical examination findings were unremarkable except for a painful hard and fixed mass measuring approximately 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 10 cm (in the transverse, anteroposterior, and craniocaudal directions, respectively) located at the right lateral superior thigh. The overlying skin was intact, without any color changes. Pertinent blood test results showed an increased white blood cell count of 13 000/\u03bcL (13 \u00d7109/L) (normal range, 3700-11 000/\u03bcL [3.7-11 \u00d7109/L]). The remaining hematologic and biochemical test results were normal. Abdominal and pelvic CT performed at presentation did not show any abnormal lymph nodes. Because chest radiography showed consolidation in addition to typical clinical picture, the patient was diagnosed with pneumonia and underwent antibiotic treatment for 3 weeks. US ( Fig 1 ) and Doppler US ( Fig 2 ) of the mass were performed. MRI was not performed because the patient had a pacemaker; instead, CT of the lower extremity was performed ( Fig 3a , 3b ). Figure 1: US image of the mass at the level of the greater trochanter. Figure 2: Doppler US image of the caudal portion of the mass. Figure 3a: (a) Axial unenhanced CT image of the lesion at the level of the greater trochanter. (b) Coronal unenhanced CT image of the mass at the level of the greater trochanter.

        "To assess the incremental value of diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging over T2-weighted MR imaging at 3 T for prostate cancer detection and to investigate the use of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) to characterize tumor aggressiveness, with whole-mount step-section pathologic analysis as the reference standard.The Internal Review Board approved this HIPAA-compliant retrospective study and waived informed consent. Fifty-one patients with prostate cancer (median age, 58 years; range, 46-74 years) underwent T2-weighted MR imaging and DW MR imaging (b values: 0 and 700 sec/mm(2) [n = 20] or 0 and 1000 sec/mm(2) [n = 31]) followed by prostatectomy. The prostate was divided into 12 regions; two readers provided a score for each region according to their level of suspicion for the presence of cancer on a five-point scale, first using T2-weighted MR imaging alone and then using T2-weighted MR imaging and the ADC map in conjunction. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) were estimated to evaluate performance. Generalized estimating equations were used to test the ADC difference between benign and malignant prostate regions and the association between ADCs and tumor Gleason scores.For tumor detection, the AUCs for readers 1 and 2 were 0.79 and 0.76, respectively, for T2-weighted MR imaging and 0.79 and 0.78, respectively, for T2-weighted MR imaging plus the ADC map. Mean ADCs for both cancerous and healthy prostatic regions were lower when DW MR imaging was performed with a b value of 1000 sec/mm(2) rather than 700 sec/mm(2). Regardless of the b value used, there was a significant difference in the mean ADC between malignant and benign prostate regions. A lower mean ADC was significantly associated with a higher tumor Gleason score (mean ADCs of [1.21, 1.10, 0.87, and 0.69] \u00d7 10(-3) mm(2)/sec were associated with Gleason score of 3 + 3, 3 + 4, 4 + 3, and 8 or higher, respectively; P = .017).Combined DW and T2-weighted MR imaging had similar performance to T2-weighted MR imaging alone for tumor detection; however, DW MR imaging provided additional quantitative information that significantly correlated with prostate cancer aggressiveness.",
        "Background Accurate estimation of the malignancy risk of pulmonary nodules at chest CT is crucial for optimizing management in lung cancer screening. Purpose To develop and validate a deep learning (DL) algorithm for malignancy risk estimation of pulmonary nodules detected at screening CT. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, the DL algorithm was developed with 16 077 nodules (1249 malignant) collected -between 2002 and 2004 from the National Lung Screening Trial. External validation was performed in the following three -cohorts -collected between 2004 and 2010 from the Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial: a full cohort containing all 883 nodules (65 -malignant) and two cancer-enriched cohorts with size matching (175 nodules, 59 malignant) and without size matching (177 -nodules, 59 malignant) of benign nodules selected at random. Algorithm performance was measured by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and compared with that of the Pan-Canadian Early Detection of Lung Cancer (PanCan) model in the full cohort and a group of 11 clinicians composed of four thoracic radiologists, five radiology residents, and two pulmonologists in the cancer-enriched cohorts. Results The DL algorithm significantly outperformed the PanCan model in the full cohort (AUC, 0.93 [95% CI: 0.89, 0.96] vs 0.90 [95% CI: 0.86, 0.93]; P = .046). The algorithm performed comparably to thoracic radiologists in cancer-enriched cohorts with both random benign nodules (AUC, 0.96 [95% CI: 0.93, 0.99] vs 0.90 [95% CI: 0.81, 0.98]; P = .11) and size-matched benign nodules (AUC, 0.86 [95% CI: 0.80, 0.91] vs 0.82 [95% CI: 0.74, 0.89]; P = .26). Conclusion The deep learning algorithm showed excellent performance, comparable to thoracic radiologists, for malignancy risk estimation of pulmonary nodules detected at screening CT. This algorithm has the potential to provide reliable and reproducible malignancy risk scores for clinicians, which may help optimize management in lung cancer screening. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Purpose To define the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging prevalence of pancreatic cysts in a cohort of patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) compared with a control group without ADPKD that was matched for age, sex, and renal function. Materials and Methods In this HIPAA-compliant, institutional review board\u2013approved study, all patients with ADPKD provided informed consent; for control subjects, informed consent was waived. Patients with ADPKD (n = 110) with mutations identified in PKD1 or PKD2 and control subjects without ADPKD or known pancreatic disease (n = 110) who were matched for age, sex, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and date of MR imaging examination were evaluated for pancreatic cysts by using axial and coronal single-shot fast spin-echo T2-weighted images obtained at 1.5 T. Total kidney volume and liver volume were measured. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to evaluate potential associations between collected variables and presence of pancreatic cysts among patients with ADPKD. The number, size, location, and imaging characteristics of the cysts were recorded. Results Patients with ADPKD were significantly more likely than control subjects to have at least one pancreatic cyst (40 of 110 patients [36%] vs 25 of 110 control subjects [23%]; P = .027). In a univariate analysis, pancreatic cysts were more prevalent in patients with ADPKD with mutations in PKD2 than in PKD1 (21 of 34 patients [62%] vs 19 of 76 patients [25%]; P = .0002). In a multivariable logistic regression model, PKD2 mutation locus was significantly associated with the presence of pancreatic cysts (P = .0004) and with liver volume (P = .038). Patients with ADPKD and a pancreatic cyst were 5.9 times more likely to have a PKD2 mutation than a PKD1 mutation after adjusting for age, race, sex, estimated glomerular filtration rate, liver volume, and total kidney volume. Conclusion Pancreatic cysts were more prevalent in patients with ADPKD with PKD2 mutation than in control subjects or patients with PKD1 mutation. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",
        "Purpose To retrospectively analyze whether Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 2 is helpful for the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer. Materials and Methods Institutional review board approved this retrospective study. A total of 425 patients with prostate cancer who had undergone magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and radical prostatectomy were included. Preoperative parameters such as prostate-specific antigen, biopsy Gleason score, greatest percentage of the core, percentage of the positive core number, and score at PI-RADS version 2 with MR imaging were investigated. Two independent readers performed PI-RADS scoring. Clinically significant prostate cancer was defined as follows: (a) Gleason score of 7 or greater, (b) tumor volume of 0.5 cm(3) or greater, or a (c) positive extracapsular extension or seminal vesicle invasion. The reference standard was based on review of surgical specimen. Logistic regression was conducted to determine which parameters are associated with the presence of clinically significant cancer. Interreader agreement (ie, score \u22654 or not) was investigated by using \u03ba statistics. Results At univariate analysis, all of the preoperative parameters were significant for clinically significant prostate cancer (P < .05). However, multivariate analysis revealed that PI-RADS score was the only significant parameter for both readers (reader 1: odds ratio = 28.170, P = .002; reader 2: odds ratio = 5.474, P = .007). The interreader agreement was excellent for PI-RADS score of 4 or greater (weighted \u03ba = 0.801; 95% confidence interval: 0.737, 0.865). Conclusion The use of PI-RADS version 2 may help preoperatively diagnose clinically significant prostate cancer. (\u00a9) RSNA, 2016.",
        "To investigate the relationship between spiculated masses at mammography and marginal adipose tissue invasion at histologic examination.The institutional review board approved this retrospective study, and the requirement to obtain informed consent was waived. A total of 478 patients with invasive breast cancer who underwent surgery between 1999 and 2009 were included in this study. Clinical-pathologic findings from patients with spiculated masses on mammograms were compared with those from patients without spiculated masses by using logistic regression models, Cox proportional hazards regression models, and the Kaplan-Meier method.There were 136 spiculated tumors and 342 nonspiculated tumors. All 136 spiculated tumors (100%) were positive for adipose tissue invasion, whereas only 264 of the 342 nonspiculated tumors (77%) were positive for adipose tissue invasion (P < .001). Multivariate analysis revealed that adipose tissue invasion (P < .001), histologic grade (P < .001), dense breast (P = .002), and body mass index (P = .02) were independent factors associated with spiculation. With regard to survival, although many patients with spiculated tumors had a hormone-sensitive (estrogen receptor positive: P = .004; progesterone receptor positive: P = .001) or low-grade (P < .001) tumor, in contrast to the patients without spiculated masses, the prognosis in the two groups was similar (disease-free survival: P = .09; overall survival: P = .23).Cancer cell interaction with adipose tissue is crucial for the finding of spiculation at mammography.",
        "To test the image features that may be useful in predicting the visually lossless thresholds (VLTs) of body computed tomographic (CT) images for Joint Photographic Experts Group 2000 (JPEG2000) compression.The institutional review board approved this study, with a waiver of informed patient consent. One hundred body CT studies obtained in different patients by using five scanning protocols were obtained, and 100 images, each of which was selected from each of the 100 studies, were collected. Five radiologists independently determined the VLT of each image for JPEG2000 compression by using the QUEST algorithm. The 100 images were randomly divided into two data sets-the training set (50 images) and the testing set (50 images)-and the division was repeated 200 times. For each of the 200 divisions, a multiple linear regression model was constructed on a training set and tested on a testing set regarding each of five image features-standard deviation of image intensity, image entropy, relative percentage of low-frequency (LF) energy, variation in high-frequency (HF) energy, and visual complexity-as independent variables and considering the VLTs determined with the median value of the radiologists' responses as a dependent variable. The root mean square residual and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for the 200 divisions between the VLTs predicted by the models and those determined by radiologists were compared between the models by using repeated-measures analysis of variance with post-hoc comparisons.Mean root-mean-square residuals for multiple linear regression models constructed with variation in HF energy (1.20 \u00b1 0.10 [standard deviation]) and visual complexity (1.09 \u00b1 0.07) were significantly lower than those for standard deviation of image intensity (1.65 \u00b1 0.13), image entropy (1.63 \u00b1 0.14), and relative percentage of LF energy (1.58 \u00b1 0.12) (P < .01). ICCs for variation in HF energy (0.64 \u00b1 0.05) and visual complexity (0.71 \u00b1 0.04) were significantly higher than those for standard deviation of image intensity (0.04 \u00b1 0.02), image entropy (0.05 \u00b1 0.02), and relative percentage of LF energy (0.20 \u00b1 0.04) (P < .01).Among the five tested image features, variation in HF energy and visual complexity were the most promising in predicting the VLTs of body CT images for JPEG2000 compression.",
        "Purpose To determine feasibility of performing bilateral dual-energy (DE) contrast agent\u2013enhanced (CE) digital mammography and to evaluate its performance compared with conventional digital mammography and breast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in women with known breast cancer. Materials and Methods This study was approved by the institutional review board and was HIPAA compliant. Written informed consent was obtained. Patient accrual began in March 2010 and ended in August 2011. Mean patient age was 49.6 years (range, 25\u201374 years). Feasibility was evaluated in 10 women with newly diagnosed breast cancer who were injected with 1.5 mL per kilogram of body weight of iohexol and imaged between 2.5 and 10 minutes after injection. Once feasibility was confirmed, 52 women with newly diagnosed cancer who had undergone breast MR imaging gave consent to undergo DE CE digital mammography. Positive findings were confirmed with pathologic findings. Results Feasibility was confirmed with no adverse events. Visualization of tumor enhancement was independent of timing after contrast agent injection for up to 10 minutes. MR imaging and DE CE digital mammography both depicted 50 (96%) of 52 index tumors; conventional mammography depicted 42 (81%). Lesions depicted by using DE CE digital mammography ranged from 4 to 67 mm in size (median, 17 mm). DE CE digital mammography depicted 14 (56%) of 25 additional ipsilateral cancers compared with 22 (88%) of 25 for MR imaging. There were two false-positive findings with DE CE digital mammography and 13 false-positive findings with MR imaging. There was one contralateral cancer, which was not evident with either modality. Conclusion Bilateral DE CE digital mammography was feasible and easily accomplished. It was used to detect known primary tumors at a rate comparable to that of MR imaging and higher than that of conventional digital mammography. DE CE digital mammography had a lower sensitivity for detecting additional ipsilateral cancers than did MR imaging, but the specificity was higher. \u00a9 RSNA, 2012",
        "To compare the recently proposed Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) scale that incorporates fixed criteria and a standard Likert scale based on overall impression in prostate cancer localization using multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.This retrospective study was HIPAA compliant and institutional review board approved. Seventy patients who underwent 3-T pelvic MR imaging, including T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and dynamic contrast material-enhanced imaging, with a pelvic phased-array coil before radical prostatectomy were included. Three radiologists, each with 6 years of experience, independently scored 18 regions (12 peripheral zone [PZ], six transition zone [TZ]) using PI-RADS (range, scores 3-15) and Likert (range, scores 1-5) scales. Logistic regression for correlated data was used to compare scales for detection of tumors larger than 3 mm in maximal diameter at prostatectomy.Maximal accuracy was achieved with score thresholds of 8 and higher and of 3 and higher for PI-RADS and Likert scales, respectively. At these thresholds, in the PZ, similar accuracy was achieved with the PI-RADS scale and the Likert scale for radiologist 1 (89.0% vs 88.2%, P = .223) and radiologist 3 (88.5% vs 88.2%, P = .739) and greater accuracy was achieved with the PI-RADS scale than the Likert scale for radiologist 2 (89.6% vs 87.1%, P = .008). In the TZ, accuracy was lower with the PI-RADS scale than with the Likert scale for radiologist 1 (70.0% vs 87.1%, P < .001), radiologist 2 (87.6% vs 92.6%, P = .002), and radiologist 3 (82.9% vs 91.2%, P < .001). For tumors with Gleason score of at least 7, sensitivity was higher with the PI-RADS scale than with the Likert scale for radiologist 1 (88.6% vs 82.6%, P = .032), and sensitivity was similar for radiologist 2 (78.0% vs 76.5, P = .467) and radiologist 3 (77.3% vs 81.1%, P = .125).Radiologists performed well with both PI-RADS and Likert scales for tumor localization, although, in the TZ, performance was better with the Likert scale than the PI-RADS scale.http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.13122233/-/DC1."
